into my hands so I am staying on this

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.900 
into my hands so I am staying on this
spot<00:03:44.470> longer<00:03:44.920> than<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.160> would<00:03:45.220> normally<00:03:45.490> stay

spot longer than I would normally stay
on<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.270> spot<00:03:46.480> just<00:03:46.840> because<00:03:49.200> I'm<00:03:50.200> getting<00:03:50.530> a

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
on this spot just because I'm getting a

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.470 
on this spot just because I'm getting a
reaction<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.520> as<00:03:51.670> long<00:03:51.850> as<00:03:51.880> I'm<00:03:52.150> getting<00:03:52.270> a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
reaction and as long as I'm getting a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.900 
reaction and as long as I'm getting a
reaction<00:03:52.630> from<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.320> horse<00:03:53.560> I'm<00:03:54.280> gonna<00:03:54.640> stay

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
reaction from that horse I'm gonna stay

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:12.610 
reaction from that horse I'm gonna stay
in<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.150> area<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:56.110> how<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.410> read<00:03:56.770> them

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.070 

there<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.740> a<00:04:13.770> nice<00:04:14.010> short<00:04:14.400> little<00:04:14.930> waiting<00:04:15.930> for

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
there is a nice short little waiting for

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:32.460 
there is a nice short little waiting for
the<00:04:16.140> big<00:04:16.260> one

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.040 

I'm<00:04:33.040> only<00:04:33.220> on<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.550> low<00:04:33.700> setting<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.840> light

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
I'm only on the low setting of the light

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.190 
I'm only on the low setting of the light
because<00:04:35.770> I'm<00:04:36.010> not<00:04:36.220> trying<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.850> go<00:04:37.170> into<00:04:38.170> a

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
because I'm not trying to go into a

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.280 
because I'm not trying to go into a
large<00:04:38.560> area<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:39.040> tissue<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:41.110> there's

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
large area of tissue and so there's

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.540 
large area of tissue and so there's
about<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.680> difference<00:04:42.100> in<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.370> light

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
about the difference in the light

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.310 
about the difference in the light
settings<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.600> lights<00:04:43.780> have<00:04:44.020> three

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
settings that the lights have three

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.650 
settings that the lights have three
settings<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.790> difference<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.360> where

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
settings and so the difference is where

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.300 
settings and so the difference is where
is<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.960> tissue<00:04:47.770> you're<00:04:48.520> working<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.150> itself<00:04:49.750> or

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
is a tissue you're working on itself or

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.160 
is a tissue you're working on itself or
how<00:04:51.310> far<00:04:51.580> you're<00:04:51.790> trying<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.210> go<00:04:52.330> into<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.900> for

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
how far you're trying to go into it for

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.150 
how far you're trying to go into it for
for<00:04:53.860> penetration<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.580> light<00:04:55.770> yes<00:04:56.770> both<00:04:57.130> of

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
for penetration of the light yes both of

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.570 
for penetration of the light yes both of
those<00:04:57.490> things<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.620> always<00:04:59.620> like<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.040> start<00:05:00.400> on

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
those things I always like to start on

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.910 
those things I always like to start on
the<00:05:00.700> low<00:05:00.850> setting<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.450> get<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.810> feeling<00:05:02.620> for

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
the low setting and get a feeling for

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.190 
the low setting and get a feeling for
how<00:05:03.220> much<00:05:03.580> they<00:05:03.760> can<00:05:03.820> tolerate<00:05:04.120> there's<00:05:04.990> so

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
how much they can tolerate there's so

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.800 
how much they can tolerate there's so
much<00:05:05.320> more<00:05:05.470> sensitive<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:06.360> energy<00:05:07.360> than<00:05:07.600> we

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
much more sensitive to energy than we

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.470 
much more sensitive to energy than we
are<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:08.320> any<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:09.490> slightest<00:05:10.030> thing<00:05:10.240> they'll

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
are so any the slightest thing they'll

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.200 
are so any the slightest thing they'll
feel<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.290> if<00:05:11.590> they<00:05:11.860> can<00:05:12.460> tolerate<00:05:12.640> it<00:05:13.090> on

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
feel that so if they can tolerate it on

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.450 
feel that so if they can tolerate it on
a<00:05:13.240> high<00:05:13.450> setting<00:05:13.690> I'll<00:05:13.960> turn<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.010> up<00:05:15.160> if<00:05:15.310> I'm

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
a high setting I'll turn that up if I'm

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.060 
a high setting I'll turn that up if I'm
going<00:05:15.730> into<00:05:15.970> just<00:05:16.480> looking<00:05:16.870> for<00:05:17.050> tissue<00:05:17.260> but

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
going into just looking for tissue but

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.650 
going into just looking for tissue but
if<00:05:18.190> I'm<00:05:18.340> trying<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.670> stimulate<00:05:18.910> acupressure

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
if I'm trying to stimulate acupressure

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.540 
if I'm trying to stimulate acupressure
points<00:05:20.110> or<00:05:20.230> any<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.470> these<00:05:20.560> suppressed<00:05:21.040> points

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
points or any of these suppressed points

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.370 
points or any of these suppressed points
they<00:05:21.760> are<00:05:21.790> right<00:05:22.330> below<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.780> surface<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.260> the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
they are right below the surface of the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.690 
they are right below the surface of the
skin<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:23.980> they<00:05:24.550> don't<00:05:24.730> need<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.450> high<00:05:25.720> setting

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
skin and they don't need a high setting

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.810 
skin and they don't need a high setting
to<00:05:27.700> stimulate<00:05:28.240> them

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.880 

I'm<00:05:32.820> kind<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.180> in<00:05:33.480> this<00:05:33.660> shoulder<00:05:34.200> area<00:05:34.500> longer

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
I'm kind of in this shoulder area longer

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.560 
I'm kind of in this shoulder area longer
than<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.100> would<00:05:35.250> normally<00:05:35.280> but<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.420> can

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
than I would normally but it you can

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.970 
than I would normally but it you can
tell<00:05:36.840> already<00:05:39.200> that<00:05:40.200> we're<00:05:40.410> getting<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.770> lot

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
tell already that we're getting a lot

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.520 
tell already that we're getting a lot
less<00:05:41.510> reaction<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:42.960> kind<00:05:43.170> of<00:05:43.260> want<00:05:43.410> I'd

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
less reaction and I kind of want I'd

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.330 
less reaction and I kind of want I'd
