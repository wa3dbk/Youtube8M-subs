 Talk Crocodile Crocodile Games games 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.870
 we are here today for one more tip 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.000
 sensational crocodile games to tip the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.860
 different way that you only find 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.340
 here , everyone, what I 'm talking about 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.029
 here for you I did not test and I go 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 I'll talk again slowly, I will not 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.820
 I tested two friends of my reliability 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 they are very reliable the game 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 videogame with them from fifa to 9 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.800
 they said that for me crocodile people 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.940
 discovered a buggy not to fall from 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.309
 division 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 That's when I thought about it and that's it. 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.219
 told me what happened to him 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.329
 personally what was happening 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.660
 with him 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.100
 he was losing the game he had 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.780
 to win to stay in the division 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.360
 So he had to win was 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.300
 losing the opponent who was 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.340
 winning was touching the ball behind 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.320
 got the anti game and it happened 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 He got really pissed at that situation. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.539
 said bitch shit I'm going to fall apart 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.790
 Did not wait or the game was over there. 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.310
 squeezed off the game was there 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.250
 pressed the button that turns the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.070
 video game but the afternoon was that he came back 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.400
 to play fifa started appeared 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 message that he had given up the game 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.820
 he lost the dn efe 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.009
 I just want him to go in. He has. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.159
 continued in the first division 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.780
 say he did not fall apart with akon 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.360
 turning off video game 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.000
 so he thought it's a fifa bug that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.400
 It's happening, so I do not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930
