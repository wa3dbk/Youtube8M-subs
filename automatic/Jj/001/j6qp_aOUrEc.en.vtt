below<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.250> have<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.460> climate<00:01:38.000> control<00:01:38.390> this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
below you have the climate control this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
below you have the climate control this
is<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.530> ebrake

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
is the ebrake

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.700 
is the ebrake
I<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:41.450> how<00:01:41.600> they<00:01:41.720> integrated<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
I like how they integrated it and the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.890 
I like how they integrated it and the
handle<00:01:43.480> it's<00:01:44.480> nicely<00:01:44.690> hidden<00:01:45.430> pull<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.900> it's

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.060 
handle it's nicely hidden pull it it's
quite<00:01:48.110> easy<00:01:48.229> it's<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:48.590> difficult<00:01:49.040> to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
quite easy it's not difficult to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.650 
quite easy it's not difficult to
disengage<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:49.880> pull<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.120> down<00:01:50.150> pull<00:01:50.630> a

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
disengage just pull it down pull a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.200 
disengage just pull it down pull a
little<00:01:50.780> just<00:01:51.350> goes<00:01:51.500> right<00:01:51.650> back<00:01:51.800> up<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:53.090> not

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
little just goes right back up it's not

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.730 
little just goes right back up it's not
going<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.390> flap<00:01:53.720> around<00:01:53.750> because<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.620> has<00:01:54.710> a
