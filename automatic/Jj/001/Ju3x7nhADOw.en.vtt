00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
but I figured out a way to get to it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.230 
but I figured out a way to get to it
because<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:04.530> took<00:01:04.680> me<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> while<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.519> like

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
getting past all that water that's a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.160 
getting past all that water that's a
death<00:01:08.250> barrier<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.180> hard<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.570> i'll

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
death barrier is pretty hard but i'll

and<00:01:30.200> quite<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> journey<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.100> there

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and quite a bit of journey out there

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
and quite a bit of journey out there
because<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> past<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
because you have to get it past all the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
because you have to get it past all the
water<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:35.070> burying<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.920> but<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
water that's burying all out but all you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.190 
water that's burying all out but all you
gotta<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.750> back<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
gotta do is just go back the way you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
gotta do is just go back the way you
came<00:01:40.380> from<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.189> jump<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> map<00:01:42.119> from

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
came from just jump out of the map from

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.609 
came from just jump out of the map from
over<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.110> jump<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
over here you have to jump from this

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.960 
over here you have to jump from this
side<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> jump<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> other

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
side because if you jump from the other

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
side because if you jump from the other
sides<00:01:45.299> there's<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.439> wall<00:01:46.710> barriers

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
sides there's just wall barriers

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
sides there's just wall barriers
everywhere<00:01:47.820> where<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> buildings<00:01:48.630> become

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
everywhere where the buildings become

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
everywhere where the buildings become
real<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.560> no<00:01:49.920> random<00:01:50.340> reason<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> fast

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
real for no random reason I'm a fast

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
Ford it for a second time because it's a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
Ford it for a second time because it's a
long<00:01:54.240> trip<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.810> out<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
long trip to get out there because you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.530 
long trip to get out there because you
have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> get<00:01:56.310> past<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.969> wall<00:01:57.210> into<00:01:57.360> my

life and then you have to get past the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.930 
life and then you have to get past the
water<00:01:59.490> barrier

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.100

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.260 
in right up here at the top you can see
that's<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> island<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:08.979> 12<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.790> bridges

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
that's the island on 12 and the bridges

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.680 
that's the island on 12 and the bridges
fake<00:02:10.509> everything<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.140> fake<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.330> there's<00:02:13.330> I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
fake everything is fake and there's I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.150 
fake everything is fake and there's I
thought<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.050> was<00:02:14.110> no<00:02:14.350> way<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> get<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.770> until<00:02:15.130> I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
thought it was no way to get to until I

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.770 
thought it was no way to get to until I
find<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> travel<00:02:15.940> far<00:02:16.180> enough<00:02:16.360> out<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
find the travel far enough out of the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.270 
find the travel far enough out of the
mountain<00:02:17.080> where<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> could<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.560> under<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
mountain where I could get under and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.100 
mountain where I could get under and

then I was like hey I see a piece of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.320 
then I was like hey I see a piece of
land<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.830> follows<00:02:21.040> right<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.090> map

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
land that just follows right on the map

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.170
