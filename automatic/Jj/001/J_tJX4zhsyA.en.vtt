00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 moin moin is important out there 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.680
 instead of 1 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:19.340
 I'm at rally team deathmatch object 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:19.340
 alone were enough and there is a corner 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.119
 is possible in the face had the good 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:38.210
 start target and switch I have one 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.210
 490 not yet 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:57.420
 europe come outside so kraus hair 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.420
 across from Europe 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.440
 as cold 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:20.910
 there you come and you do not want that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.910
 daughter you are 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.010
 and I get shorter because I just 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 such a stupid idiot I do not care 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.840
 We have quite good in the pliers 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.950
 because with me nice try 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.460
 I can not do anything then 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.680
 not very good 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:52.190
 as soon as that was close and look out xh 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.940
 no matter that is still alright 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.940
 two tips 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:25.920
 that started again after shit 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.920
 It was well done with Roth today 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.830
 what do I have for a team unbelievable 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.620
 still located drone yes what then 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.620
 everything else 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.600
 I did not hit that balance 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:35.740
 so first get a nice quad or 40 14 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.030
 However, he could still go in order so 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.690
 Often missing but you can certainly 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.639
 take today I want ks but dear 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.780
 from you one against one the competition 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.370
 even if you already applied 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.880
 just have one more under it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.960
 Write that I can see that, too. Yes 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.460
 that has my match again 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:06.210

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:06.210
