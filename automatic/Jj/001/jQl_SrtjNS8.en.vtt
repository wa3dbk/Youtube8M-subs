00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.970
What's going on guys.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.030
My name is Eric. This is watch your style,
where I pretty much discuss different watch

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.170
trends coming in and out and what's hot and
what's not.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.880
Today, I have here the Yacht-Master. Yacht-Master
1 men's 40mm. This is the new one released

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840
in 2012 with that new Sunray dial.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.739
You know what? I haven't seen too many of
them out there, even though I've sold many

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.580
of them, but I really like this watch. Why?

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.540
The other one was a really nice classic design.
Very successful watch by Rolex. They probably

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.800
sold millions of the other one, with the silver
dial, which I'm not sure if everybody knows

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.290
this, but the dial on the previous one is
actually a platinum dial.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.780
It's made out of platinum with like a bead
blast on it, before they obviously apply all

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.170
the insignias and all that. And the bezel
itself, the actual inner bezel, the insert

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.030
is platinum as well.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.910
This time what they did around is that they
did it a little bit different. They introduced

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.990
this blue dial. It's called I believe the
Sunray blue dial. You know they get crazy

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.550
with these names. Sunray blue dial.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.429
And the most important thing besides the dial
to me, what also makes a difference is this

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.270
new clasp, which Rolex finally stepped up
the game with the clasp.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.330
For years they were using that stamped design
clasp. It's a good clasp, but this is like

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.940
a whole other level in clasp-sphere.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.940
Now, something that I want to point out about
this new design of the Yacht-Master is, in

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.470
the watch game, this is the next level when
it comes to the steel Yacht-Master game.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.310
When you see somebody wearing the previous
model with the silver platinum dial, it's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.380
a beautiful watch. I'm not going to hate on
it. I think it's a fantastic watch.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.250
If you want to buy something that's a little
bit more next level beyond the standard Sub

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.420
or something like that, the Yacht-Master is
a good choice.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.890
Good for everything. Fits with everything.
Since it's silver on silver, it matches with

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.830
everything.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.950
However, the bad thing about it is that although
you might have a 2009 with box and papers

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.170
and you picked it up in mint condition, some
people might not give you that credit. They

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.230
might think it's a 99.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.830
Whereas this one right here there's absolutely
no confusion. It's a brand new model. This

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.330
thing changes the value of the watch, the
fact that it has the blue dial and this on

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.440
another level.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.530
The other previous one, you could pick one
up probably around as low as 55 to as high

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.110
as 7500 depending who you're buying it from
and what year and condition. Whereas this

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.110
one retails around 12,000. If you want to
buy it at the AD, that's your choice.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.080
I think that the right way to buy this watch
is pre-owned. You are looking to spend around

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.980
9200 dollars.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.130
So this blue dial it separates the men from
the boys in this Yacht-Master. When someone

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.600
sees you with this watch, you're like "Wow,
that's the brand new one!"

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.980
That's what still you see right now on the
expressway. A lot of ads still with this watch.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.370
As far as the blue, you don't see a lot of
these. And when you see it, you're in that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.870
category just like the green Hulk Submariner,
that it's like a brand new watch. There's

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.600
no confusion. There's no mistaking it.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.490
So, if you're looking to get a nice watch
in the 9000-dollar area that's pretty versatile,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.140
the Yacht-Master with the blue dial. Very
nice. I like it and I've sold many of them

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.319
and everybody's very happy with that watch.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.300
So here's the bottom line. If you're thinking
about getting that new Yacht-Master with the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.580
blue dial, I think it's a really nice watch.
Goes with everything. Very, very good for

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.720
the daily use.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.770
I really like the blue dial. I don't know
what it is. They had it before with the two-tone

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.510
and the all-gold and they never had it before
on the stainless steel and platinum.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.640
Ever since they added it, immediately when
I saw the billboard, I was like drawn to it

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.720
like, "Oh my God!" It's a solid watch
for around that price range.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.580
