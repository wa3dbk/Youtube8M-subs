hi everyone we're here at John Suthers

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi everyone we're here at John Suthers
auto<00:00:03.419> repair<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.020> today<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.770> have<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> 2006<00:00:05.759> h2

auto repair and today we have a 2006 h2

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.419 
auto repair and today we have a 2006 h2
Hummer<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.560> took<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.069> test<00:00:08.340> drive

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Hummer and I took it for a test drive

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.000 
Hummer and I took it for a test drive
and<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.150> got<00:00:09.179> some<00:00:09.450> misfires<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.530> has<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> big

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
and it's got some misfires it has a big

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.280 
and it's got some misfires it has a big
loss<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.400> power<00:00:11.750> has<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> hard<00:00:13.080> time<00:00:13.110> getting

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
loss of power has a hard time getting

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.980 
loss of power has a hard time getting
out<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> its<00:00:13.830> own<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.480> so<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> all

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
out of its own way so we get it all

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.460 
out of its own way so we get it all
system<00:00:16.379> scan<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.960> came<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.260> with

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
system scan on it and we came up with

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.870 
system scan on it and we came up with
four<00:00:19.890> codes<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.640> has<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.640> one

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
four codes that it has so the first one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.990 
four codes that it has so the first one
is<00:00:23.910> PEO<00:00:24.570> 300<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> engine<00:00:26.400> misfires

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
is PEO 300 it has the engine misfires

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.900 
is PEO 300 it has the engine misfires
detected<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.250> then<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.550> scroll<00:00:29.849> down

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
detected and then we can scroll down

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.650 
detected and then we can scroll down
here<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> other<00:00:30.990> ones<00:00:38.300> then<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
here and see the other ones then we have

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.380 
here and see the other ones then we have
a<00:00:39.690> u<00:00:43.760> 1064<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.760> lots<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> communication

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
a u 1064 and it's lots of communication

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
a u 1064 and it's lots of communication
with<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> body<00:00:48.989> control<00:00:49.379> module<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:49.890> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
with the body control module and we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
with the body control module and we
haven't<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.940> an<00:00:51.059> issue<00:00:51.210> sometimes<00:00:51.510> with

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
haven't we have an issue sometimes with

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.279 
haven't we have an issue sometimes with
your<00:00:51.989> conditioning<00:00:52.440> won't<00:00:52.649> work<00:00:57.079> then<00:00:58.079> we

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
your conditioning won't work then we

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
your conditioning won't work then we
have<00:00:59.750> u<00:01:00.750> 1000<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> class<00:01:01.829> 2<00:01:02.129> datalink

malfunction and I have to look that up

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
malfunction and I have to look that up
and<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.610> what's<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.720> 1,000

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and see what's going are you 1,000

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
and see what's going are you 1,000
excuse<00:01:07.770> me<00:01:07.920> look<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.119> what's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
excuse me look that up and see what's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.410 
excuse me look that up and see what's
going<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> could<00:01:12.330> be

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
going on with that but that could be

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.310 
going on with that but that could be
some<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> reason<00:01:13.020> why<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> air

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
some of the reason why the air

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
some of the reason why the air
conditioning<00:01:13.770> doesn't<00:01:13.920> work<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.729> different

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
conditioning doesn't work at different

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.020 
conditioning doesn't work at different
times<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.009> then<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.100> came<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> outside

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
times so then we came out to the outside

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.560 
times so then we came out to the outside
and<00:01:18.240> start<00:01:18.479> looking<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.840> things<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.570> look

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and start looking at things and look

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
and start looking at things and look
down<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> saw<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> someone's<00:01:23.340> replace<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
down and saw that someone's replace the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
down and saw that someone's replace the
battery<00:01:24.090> pretty<00:01:24.270> recently<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:26.340> has<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
battery pretty recently here it has a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.560 
battery pretty recently here it has a
date<00:01:26.790> code<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.330> February<00:01:28.229> 2013<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
date code of February 2013 and the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
date code of February 2013 and the
little<00:01:30.780> code<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.619> read<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.689> there

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
little code here if we can read it there

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.980 
little code here if we can read it there
we<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> backwards<00:01:35.479> if<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.630> look<00:01:36.810> at

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we go but it's backwards if you look at

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.010 
we go but it's backwards if you look at
the<00:01:37.170> positive<00:01:37.590> battery<00:01:37.680> cable<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.869> see

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the positive battery cable you can see

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.740 
the positive battery cable you can see
that<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> cable<00:01:40.799> itself<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that the cable itself here is all the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.440 
that the cable itself here is all the
way<00:01:43.310> smashed<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.460> against<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> metal<00:01:45.149> part<00:01:45.360> of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
way smashed up against the metal part of

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.590 
way smashed up against the metal part of
the<00:01:45.890> frame<00:01:46.890> runner<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.360> eventually

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the frame runner there so eventually

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
the frame runner there so eventually
that<00:01:48.750> cable<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> run<00:01:49.619> through<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that cable is going to run through and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.399 
that cable is going to run through and
weld<00:01:50.549> against<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> frame<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.140> I'm<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
weld against the frame so I'm going to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
weld against the frame so I'm going to
loosen<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.770> lock<00:01:53.040> nut<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.579> bring<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
loosen that lock nut up and bring that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.240 
loosen that lock nut up and bring that
cable<00:01:54.750> down<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.590> straight<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
cable down so it's more straight up and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.030 
cable down so it's more straight up and
down<00:01:56.990> these<00:01:57.990> usually<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> protective

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
down these usually have a protective

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.719 
down these usually have a protective
cover<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.399> them<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:02.100> cover<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> also

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
cover over them and the cover is also

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
cover over them and the cover is also
missing<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:03.740> then<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> steering<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
missing on this one then the steering is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.469 
missing on this one then the steering is
really<00:02:05.520> loose<00:02:05.729> when<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> drive<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> down<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
really loose when you drive it down the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.940 
really loose when you drive it down the
roads<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> scary<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> drive<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
roads kind of scary to drive it

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.199 
roads kind of scary to drive it
and<00:02:09.039> here's<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.149> steering<00:02:10.569> box<00:02:12.090> come<00:02:13.090> here

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
and here's the steering box come here

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.089 
and here's the steering box come here
coming<00:02:13.569> from<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.720> steering<00:02:14.170> box<00:02:14.380> up<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
coming from the steering box up to the

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.540 
coming from the steering box up to the
steering<00:02:15.459> wheel<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.550> steering

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
steering wheel is this is this steering

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.350 
steering wheel is this is this steering
rod<00:02:18.880> right<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.209> or<00:02:19.569> steering<00:02:19.930> linkage<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
rod right here or steering linkage and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.760 
rod right here or steering linkage and
it's<00:02:22.480> just<00:02:22.630> got<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> whole<00:02:23.050> bunch<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.319> play<00:02:23.560> in

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
it's just got a whole bunch of play in

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.340 
it's just got a whole bunch of play in
here<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:27.569> when<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.660> look<00:02:28.840> down<00:02:29.020> at<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
here and when you look down at the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.000 
here and when you look down at the
steering<00:02:31.200> let's<00:02:32.200> see<00:02:32.350> if<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.620> put<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.800> light

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
steering let's see if I can put a light

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.699 
steering let's see if I can put a light
down<00:02:33.160> here<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.520> we<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.709> someone's

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
down here so we can see it someone's

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.229 
down here so we can see it someone's
also<00:02:35.950> chased<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.310> bunch<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.580> front-end<00:02:36.880> parts

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
also chased a bunch of front-end parts

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.430 
also chased a bunch of front-end parts
but<00:02:37.390> some<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.690> grease<00:02:37.870> cutting<00:02:38.200> into<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
but some of the grease cutting into the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.509 
but some of the grease cutting into the
ball<00:02:38.620> joints<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.010> everything<00:02:39.280> don't<00:02:39.370> have

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
ball joints and everything don't have

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.970 
ball joints and everything don't have
very<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.760> grease<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.180> them<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.739> don't<00:02:41.830> know

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
very much grease in them so I don't know

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.080 
very much grease in them so I don't know
what<00:02:42.130> know<00:02:42.280> what<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.519> figure<00:02:42.760> out<00:02:42.880> what<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
what know what to figure out what the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.820 
what know what to figure out what the
deal<00:02:43.269> with<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:46.049> but<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.110> can<00:02:47.319> move<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
deal with that is but I can move this a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.259 
deal with that is but I can move this a
whole<00:02:48.130> bunch<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.640> if<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.819> look<00:02:48.940> right<00:02:49.060> that

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
whole bunch and if you look right that

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.460 
whole bunch and if you look right that
grease<00:02:49.510> fitting<00:02:49.840> down<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.260> where

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
grease fitting down there that's where

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.100 
grease fitting down there that's where
the<00:02:50.590> pitman<00:02:50.950> arm<00:02:51.040> comes<00:02:51.370> off<00:02:51.580> down<00:02:51.819> there<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
the pitman arm comes off down there and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.930 
the pitman arm comes off down there and
you<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.319> see<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:53.680> moving<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.160> lot<00:02:54.459> that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
you can see I'm moving this a lot that

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.690 
you can see I'm moving this a lot that
arms<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.360> even<00:02:55.600> moving<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.220> steering<00:02:57.430> box

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
arms not even moving so the steering box

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.500 
arms not even moving so the steering box
for<00:02:58.030> sure<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.540> way<00:02:58.959> out<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.200> adjustment<00:03:00.510> next

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
for sure is way out of adjustment next

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.020 
for sure is way out of adjustment next
we<00:03:01.600> got<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.810> brake<00:03:01.989> fluid<00:03:02.019> right<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:03.030> so

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
we got the brake fluid right here so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.539 
we got the brake fluid right here so
there's<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.330> reservoir<00:03:05.069> looks<00:03:06.069> dark<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.459> the

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
there's the reservoir looks dark on the

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.199 
there's the reservoir looks dark on the
outside<00:03:07.739> look<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.010> inside<00:03:09.459> looks<00:03:09.940> black

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
outside look on the inside looks black

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.509 
outside look on the inside looks black
like<00:03:10.420> engine<00:03:10.750> oil<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.920> brake<00:03:12.130> fluid<00:03:12.459> is

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
like engine oil so the brake fluid is

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.140 
like engine oil so the brake fluid is
real<00:03:12.640> dirty

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
real dirty

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.970 
real dirty
it<00:03:13.540> does<00:03:13.720> have<00:03:13.930> new<00:03:14.079> brake<00:03:14.230> pads<00:03:14.560> front<00:03:14.859> and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
it does have new brake pads front and

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.150 
it does have new brake pads front and
rear<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.530> went<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.739> check<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.010> power

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
rear and then I went to check the power

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.099 
rear and then I went to check the power
steering<00:03:18.700> fluid<00:03:18.820> which<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.510> inside<00:03:19.959> this

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
steering fluid which is inside this

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.590 
steering fluid which is inside this
reservoir<00:03:20.590> here<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.940> we'll<00:03:22.060> open<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.420> up

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
reservoir here and we'll open this up

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.490 
reservoir here and we'll open this up
and<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.410> can't<00:03:23.859> even<00:03:23.980> read<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.579> stick

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and you can't even read it on the stick

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.849 
and you can't even read it on the stick
because<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.980> very<00:03:27.100> low<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.579> fluid<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.590> we'll

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
because it's very low on fluid and we'll

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.880 
because it's very low on fluid and we'll
see<00:03:30.010> if<00:03:30.070> we<00:03:30.160> can<00:03:30.280> see<00:03:30.459> down<00:03:30.609> inside<00:03:30.850> that

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
see if we can see down inside that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.280 
see if we can see down inside that
reservoir<00:03:32.890> at<00:03:33.010> all<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.720> fluids<00:03:35.079> 'we<00:03:35.260> got

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
reservoir at all but the fluids 'we got

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.740 
reservoir at all but the fluids 'we got
at<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> bottom<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.489> reservoir<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.630> that

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
at the bottom of the reservoir so that

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.530 
at the bottom of the reservoir so that
tells<00:03:38.019> me<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.290> vehicle<00:03:38.709> has<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.859> leak<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.540> lot

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
tells me this vehicle has a leak a lot

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.240 
tells me this vehicle has a leak a lot
of<00:03:40.690> vehicles<00:03:40.840> will<00:03:41.079> have<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> power<00:03:41.590> brake<00:03:41.890> unit

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
of vehicles will have a power brake unit

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.690 
of vehicles will have a power brake unit
and<00:03:42.430> they'll<00:03:43.239> be<00:03:43.359> made<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.859> run<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.070> vacuum

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
and they'll be made to run on vacuum

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.970 
and they'll be made to run on vacuum
this<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.690> called<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.049> hydro<00:03:47.380> boost<00:03:47.530> unit<00:03:47.890> this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
this is called a hydro boost unit this

pressure<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:54.040> whole<00:03:54.220> box<00:03:54.489> here<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:54.819> can

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
pressure so this whole box here you can

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.000 
pressure so this whole box here you can
see<00:03:55.390> it's<00:03:55.510> all<00:03:55.630> these<00:03:55.810> big<00:03:55.989> stains<00:03:56.380> all<00:03:56.739> wet

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
see it's all these big stains all wet

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.819 
see it's all these big stains all wet
and<00:03:57.810> if<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.900> look<00:03:59.049> down<00:03:59.079> underneath<00:03:59.530> down

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
and if you look down underneath down

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.789 
and if you look down underneath down
here<00:04:00.130> below<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.959> see<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:02.230> just<00:04:02.260> all<00:04:02.530> wet

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
here below you can see it's just all wet

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.960 
here below you can see it's just all wet
with<00:04:02.829> fluid<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.690> what<00:04:04.690> happens<00:04:05.109> is<00:04:05.760> I'll<00:04:06.760> get

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
with fluid and what happens is I'll get

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.860 
with fluid and what happens is I'll get
a<00:04:07.000> mirror<00:04:07.299> so<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.660> show<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.900> exactly

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.710 

where<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:15.050> unit<00:04:15.410> actually<00:04:15.560> bolts<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
where the unit actually bolts to the the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.990 
where the unit actually bolts to the the
master<00:04:18.049> cylinder<00:04:18.340> it's<00:04:19.340> too<00:04:19.549> dark<00:04:19.760> we're<00:04:19.910> not

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
master cylinder it's too dark we're not

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.870 
master cylinder it's too dark we're not
going<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.180> be<00:04:20.239> able<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.480> see<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.750> but<00:04:21.880> we're

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
going to be able to see it but we're

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.530 
going to be able to see it but we're
this<00:04:23.000> unit<00:04:23.450> here<00:04:25.030> bolts<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.240> master

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
this unit here bolts of the master

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.760 
this unit here bolts of the master
cylinder<00:04:26.750> on<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:26.960> bottom<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.470> there's<00:04:27.710> a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
cylinder on the bottom is there's a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.850 
cylinder on the bottom is there's a
bleed<00:04:27.979> hole<00:04:28.220> down<00:04:28.460> there<00:04:28.729> like<00:04:29.570> a<00:04:29.600> an<00:04:30.440> over<00:04:30.710> an

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
bleed hole down there like a an over an

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.100 
bleed hole down there like a an over an
excess<00:04:31.190> hole<00:04:31.430> what's<00:04:32.389> happened<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.810> when<00:04:32.960> this

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
excess hole what's happened is when this

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.500 
excess hole what's happened is when this
boot<00:04:33.290> unit<00:04:33.590> goes<00:04:33.740> bad<00:04:34.040> all<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.060> fluid<00:04:35.389> starts

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
boot unit goes bad all the fluid starts

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.760 
boot unit goes bad all the fluid starts
to<00:04:35.660> leak<00:04:35.810> out<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.080> power<00:04:36.260> steering<00:04:36.590> fluid

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
to leak out of the power steering fluid

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.440 
to leak out of the power steering fluid
reservoir<00:04:36.950> that's<00:04:37.490> why<00:04:37.700> that's<00:04:37.880> low<00:04:38.210> and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
reservoir that's why that's low and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.040 
reservoir that's why that's low and
that's<00:04:39.380> why<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.710> all<00:04:39.860> wet<00:04:40.130> with<00:04:40.900> fluid<00:04:41.900> all

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
that's why it's all wet with fluid all

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.219 
that's why it's all wet with fluid all
down<00:04:42.320> along<00:04:42.650> here<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:44.419> it's<00:04:44.570> all<00:04:44.720> wet<00:04:44.930> down<00:04:45.110> on

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
down along here and it's all wet down on

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.890 
down along here and it's all wet down on
the<00:04:45.320> frame<00:04:45.560> rail<00:04:45.770> down<00:04:45.979> here<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.340> can<00:04:46.460> see<00:04:46.900> so

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
the frame rail down here you can see so

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.800 
the frame rail down here you can see so
it's<00:04:48.050> been<00:04:48.169> leaking<00:04:48.380> for<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.620> while<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.510> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
it's been leaking for a while and so the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.000 
it's been leaking for a while and so the
you<00:04:51.200> know<00:04:51.229> it's<00:04:51.440> going<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.620> need<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.860> have<00:04:51.979> a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
you know it's going to need to have a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.900 
you know it's going to need to have a
new<00:04:52.220> unit<00:04:52.520> put<00:04:52.669> on<00:04:52.790> there<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:54.490> misfire<00:04:55.520> it

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
new unit put on there the misfire it

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.879 
new unit put on there the misfire it
looks<00:04:56.060> like<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.270> spark<00:04:56.540> plug<00:04:56.750> wires<00:04:56.990> looks

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
looks like the spark plug wires looks

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.200 
looks like the spark plug wires looks
like<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.190> original<00:04:58.250> ones<00:04:58.760> that<00:04:58.910> came<00:04:59.060> with

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
like the original ones that came with

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.060 
like the original ones that came with
the<00:04:59.300> vehicle<00:04:59.419> it's<00:04:59.810> got<00:04:59.900> like<00:05:00.020> 110,000<00:05:00.919> miles

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
the vehicle it's got like 110,000 miles

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.510 
the vehicle it's got like 110,000 miles
on<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:05.740> then<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.800> went<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:07.010> look<00:05:07.130> at<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.370> air

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
on it and then I went to look at the air

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.350 
on it and then I went to look at the air
intake<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:09.919> can<00:05:10.040> see<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.370> just<00:05:10.460> all

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
intake and you can see it's just all

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.960 
intake and you can see it's just all
black<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:11.990> all<00:05:12.110> car<00:05:12.380> burned<00:05:12.530> up<00:05:12.680> well<00:05:13.550> part<00:05:13.940> of

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
black and all car burned up well part of

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.350 
black and all car burned up well part of
the<00:05:14.060> reason<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.479> is<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:16.760> if<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.000> look<00:05:17.150> at<00:05:17.240> the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
the reason that is is if you look at the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.350 
the reason that is is if you look at the
air<00:05:17.510> intake<00:05:18.130> bellows<00:05:19.130> here's<00:05:19.820> what<00:05:20.000> goes<00:05:20.180> to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
air intake bellows here's what goes to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.330 
air intake bellows here's what goes to
the<00:05:20.389> air<00:05:20.539> cleaner<00:05:20.810> housing<00:05:20.979> you<00:05:21.979> can<00:05:22.130> see<00:05:22.250> it's

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
the air cleaner housing you can see it's

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.690 
the air cleaner housing you can see it's
got<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> nice<00:05:22.729> round<00:05:23.210> smooth<00:05:23.930> area<00:05:24.639> where<00:05:25.639> it

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
got a nice round smooth area where it

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.990 
got a nice round smooth area where it
hooked<00:05:25.880> to<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.150> throttle<00:05:26.389> body<00:05:27.850> it's<00:05:28.850> got

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
hooked to the throttle body it's got

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.900 
hooked to the throttle body it's got
this<00:05:29.120> big<00:05:29.360> damaged<00:05:29.780> lip<00:05:30.050> here<00:05:30.639> where<00:05:31.639> someone

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
this big damaged lip here where someone

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.020 
this big damaged lip here where someone
just<00:05:32.210> forced<00:05:32.600> it<00:05:32.750> on<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:34.370> when<00:05:34.550> they<00:05:34.669> forced

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
just forced it on and when they forced

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.590 
just forced it on and when they forced
it<00:05:35.120> on<00:05:35.300> is<00:05:35.630> sucking<00:05:36.020> dirt<00:05:36.229> inside<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.830> engine

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
it on is sucking dirt inside the engine

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.940 
it on is sucking dirt inside the engine
so<00:05:39.130> down<00:05:40.130> inside<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.550> here<00:05:41.289> all<00:05:42.289> this<00:05:42.530> dirt<00:05:42.800> you

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
so down inside of here all this dirt you

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.690 
so down inside of here all this dirt you
see<00:05:43.539> not<00:05:44.539> supposed<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:44.810> be<00:05:44.960> there<00:05:45.460> if<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.520> look

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
see not supposed to be there if you look

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.950 
see not supposed to be there if you look
at<00:05:46.789> the<00:05:46.880> other<00:05:47.000> side<00:05:47.270> they<00:05:47.479> were<00:05:47.539> sealing

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
at the other side they were sealing

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.920 
at the other side they were sealing
properly<00:05:49.030> very<00:05:50.030> minimal<00:05:50.479> amount<00:05:50.690> of<00:05:50.780> dirt

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
properly very minimal amount of dirt

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.480 
properly very minimal amount of dirt
there<00:05:51.110> it's<00:05:51.320> pretty<00:05:51.500> clean<00:05:51.830> that's<00:05:52.190> how<00:05:52.340> it's

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
there it's pretty clean that's how it's

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.690 
there it's pretty clean that's how it's
supposed<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.880> be<00:05:53.710> so<00:05:54.710> someone<00:05:55.039> just<00:05:55.220> forced<00:05:55.580> it

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
supposed to be so someone just forced it

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.839 
supposed to be so someone just forced it
on<00:05:55.849> and<00:05:56.599> left<00:05:56.840> it<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.169> way<00:05:57.380> so<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.520> inside<00:05:58.820> of

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
on and left it that way so the inside of

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:05.130 
on and left it that way so the inside of
the<00:05:58.940> motor<00:05:59.120> is<00:05:59.240> full<00:05:59.419> of<00:05:59.570> carbon<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.020> dirt<00:06:00.200> now

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.250 

and<00:06:05.920> so<00:06:06.820> all<00:06:07.030> these<00:06:07.150> things<00:06:07.330> can<00:06:07.540> be<00:06:07.660> fixed<00:06:07.840> but

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
and so all these things can be fixed but

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.530 
and so all these things can be fixed but
that's<00:06:08.380> just<00:06:08.470> a<00:06:08.620> quick<00:06:08.800> overview<00:06:09.420> when<00:06:10.420> you're

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
that's just a quick overview when you're

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.720 
that's just a quick overview when you're
checking<00:06:10.810> down<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:11.020> vehicle<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:12.460> you<00:06:12.550> want

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
checking down the vehicle and you want

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.400 
checking down the vehicle and you want
to<00:06:12.820> scan<00:06:13.060> for<00:06:13.270> Coach<00:06:13.480> look<00:06:13.780> at<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.990> fluids
