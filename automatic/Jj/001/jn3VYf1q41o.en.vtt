00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.569
 this is what men 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.569
 Here I had a case 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:28.820
 I had another 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.590
 Well, the way of life of our family in general, we 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.870
 after all, semi-professional hunters 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.150
 frankly you understand of course beat 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.879
 duck on pheasants left the richest 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.570
 But in general places far east but that 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.210
 including and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.090
 underrly rural rip rei to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.820
 nothing to say of course but all the same 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.930
 We were our main hunt after all 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.659
 large beast 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.820
 and here lies the difference 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.670
 perhaps my view on the hunt at all 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.650
 because for me this kind 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.470
 hunting for amateur interesting 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.729
 nice but it's not that one 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.360
 my presentation 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:08.750
 meeting with the beast she really 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.850
 characterizes the human environment and here 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.370
 It seems to me that there is something to do if 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.530
 maybe say it well I would 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.920
 I wanted a lot of such an episode 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.540
 you know for without 12 100 to live it 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.810
 and I'm 8 years old, eight years under the tree found ju 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.630
 which I was the father will give it 1 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 the table was 14 gauge now 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.480
 caliber doesn't release it with a muzzle 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.760
 parts you need to remember 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.720
 then the cheese hangs in the powder box 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.000
 on the other side will be added at the end of it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.520
 small inserted 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.250
 bone on goa refused refused 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.500
 and here you are the old dog 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.470
 get out it poured this bone 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.820
 finger squeezed and then overturned 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.550
 put and guns x hair and tezhu 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.300
 Means there fly with this powder then 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.450
 best of all the newspaper we had in our pockets 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.180
 the newspaper mint and I spun to scored and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.980
 ramrod about drove to the end later 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.980
 I put something else still small 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 I can reach my friends then 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.700
 I knock I'll score one table this right now 2 then 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.040
 one barrel then need not yet said 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.400
 hit to check 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.790
 bounced off yes means to charge a charge and if 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.090
 ramrod does not rebound it has not yet scored 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.310
 hurt after that then you take another gift 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.260
 the hospital is already there from measuring the same 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.689
 way 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.269
 the fraction made that jump at least 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:47.829
 Pauline, too, newspaper crumpled but easier higher 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.109
 then here is such a horn in this place on 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.659
 and torzhok put on special capsule 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.299
 Katz July rushed in such a place that he 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.819

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.680

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.439
 that when hummus attacked the hunters 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.680
 unexpectedly did not kill the roe or 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:18.239
 butchered and by the fire rather by the river 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.939
 Oiled up means back hand up 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.370
