00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.890
 approximately one year ago 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 approximately that you stop recording 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 videos with my face and I wanted you 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.629

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.490

 you have also given me support and you have 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.630
 continued watching my videos even though 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.940
 it had been a long time since they were 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 engravings and well I have decided to return 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.260
 after many requests that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 I was not sure I was going back 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.640
 because now it's going to cost me again 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.749
 get the hang of both the page 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
 from youtube that has changed a lot 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:46.499
 so much to the camera that gives I like giving 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.300
 So embarrassed to see me so good 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:52.230
 I want to explain the reason why 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.489
 I left the channel no I was very good with 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 the channel was very motivated was 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.710
 also very happy to record videos 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.290
 only good as I told you in that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 video that I felt I was going 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 because something personal had happened to me and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 well then after a year day 27 of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 this month will make a year of it then 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.530
 I wanted to tell what happened to me, I stopped 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.830
 living with my father is worth my mother and me 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 we went to live somewhere else 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.020
 things that families spend the most 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.350
 normal and my parents and my father stayed 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.810
 with the kittens in charge because we were 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.530
 mother no longer could have them in the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.410
 site where we were then my father 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.250
 called one day that one of the kittens 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 I had it 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 jeyko not if you will remember it or it left in 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.890
 some video because he had died had 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.810
 dead not and what boy was another used 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.220
 kitten was also very serious with the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.010
 same symptoms that I had had 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 jeyko before I learned about this 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.120
 in a single day if I found out 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.940
 before the cats were sick 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.370
 logically then in fact what I have 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.880
 been in my hand to do that 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.270
 viviesen 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.310
 well I went to look with my mother at home 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.790
 of my father went to look for boy and of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.980
 Suddenly we also saw that I copied that yes 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.420
 you follow me you know who is what is 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.120
 very big is the data that I have 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.420
 white good is a little warmth 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 Well, it was also very bad 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.110
 We took the vet and they had good 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.480
 guys had a very serious illness 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.930
 that was contagious and possibly copito 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.269
 had the same one that happened as a boy what 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.750
 that we did not catch it in time I was 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.910
 a few weeks in veterinary emergencies 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.340
 I took care of him did not separate me from him in 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.030
 no moment then I did not feel like 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.370
 of uploading videos or recording I did not have 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.349
 desire to touch the computer itself or the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.230
 camera well I did not feel comfortable 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.160
 that my priority was to be able to save 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.160
 little bug 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.319
 unfortunately it could not be saved and that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.860
 is the reason why I stopped recording 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.120
 Copito yes that brush more on time what 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.209
 I was American for a few 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.120
 months and is now done a 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.680
 Come on screw is fine and good he 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.500
 will be the reason why I leave 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.190
 to record why 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.680
 I have a very special connection with 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.810
 the kittens good and the animals but 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.570
 especially with the kittens and guys yes 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.480
 that it's true that you guys one the last 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.640
 kitten who died because he had had 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.190
 a lot of connection with him because he was a 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.530
 cat that had been from the street what 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.280
 they brought home very little if there was 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.410
 a cat very very grateful that the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.450
 we have taken and to lead the life that 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.530
 I was carrying that my father then 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.330
 I thought that cats 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.770
 I do not know what I was thinking at that moment 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.720
 I honestly did not know what I was thinking 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.720
 that moment the medical doctors 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.090
 because the cats did not last did not last and 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.630
 because he called better now, I compete 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.989
 I would not be here if I did not call 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.330
 and good this is that topic that part what 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.510
 that came to tell was that which stops 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.450
 record because I did not enter a bit of 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.930
 pressure I did not want to do absolutely 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.690
 nothing absolutely is forgiveness I did not want 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.590
 do nothing I did not even want to enter 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.380
 house because good in that time I was 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.500
 working then he went super early to 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.980
 work maybe I got up at 5 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.370
 the morning 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.130
 and I was taking my mother to work I was going 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.260
 also to work I left I went home 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.870
 towards the house he took the cats he takes 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.370
 to the vet I both alone with the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.910
 car with cats 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.330
 they cried, they also make their things 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.669
 over in the car 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.590
 in the so-called vets then I came back 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.969
 to boar's house to cats so that 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.280
 were with the veterinarians less 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.830
 they answered serum and all the 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.650
 medicines 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.930
 and then I went back home to the food 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.910
 I was going to look for my mother I went later to 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.250
 look for the cats and well he was like 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.740
 You see I was absolutely busy and my 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.689
 priority were were they was the life of 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.779
 them and give them at least 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:40.229
 a life a little calmer and already like 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:44.299
 I tell you guys I can not survive 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.299
 because it was quite serious 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.420
 and the truth is that we had to put 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.950
 the injection and 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.760
 and good that 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:03.630
 Nothing to keep watching over our 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.630
 videos and see you in the next something
