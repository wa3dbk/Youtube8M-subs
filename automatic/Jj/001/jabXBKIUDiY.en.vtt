not know what it is but the generic name
is<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> basis<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.350> always<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
is the basis so always go back to that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.329 
is the basis so always go back to that
and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> third<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.920> chemical

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and then the third one is the chemical

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.950 
and then the third one is the chemical
name<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> chemical

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

lastly I want to talk a little bit about
the<00:03:44.100> construct<00:03:44.579> controlled<00:03:45.150> substance<00:03:45.780> order

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
the construct controlled substance order

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.740 
the construct controlled substance order
these<00:03:46.950> are<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.670> list<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.239> five<00:03:48.480> different

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
these are a list of five different

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.500 
these are a list of five different
schedules<00:03:49.410> where<00:03:50.100> some<00:03:50.579> drugs<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.329> been

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
schedules where some drugs have been

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
schedules where some drugs have been
documented<00:03:52.880> according<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.090> their<00:03:54.390> abuse<00:03:55.260> risk

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
documented according to their abuse risk

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.130 
documented according to their abuse risk
so<00:03:56.310> for<00:03:56.459> example<00:03:56.880> schedule<00:03:57.239> number<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:57.690> are

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
so for example schedule number one are

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.900 
so for example schedule number one are
completely<00:03:58.739> illegal<00:03:59.100> drugs<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.609> is<00:03:59.670> like
