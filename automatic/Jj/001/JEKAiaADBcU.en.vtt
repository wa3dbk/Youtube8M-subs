Alpha goes live the technical alpha and

videos and livestream and whatnot very
very<00:01:21.090> exciting<00:01:21.600> times<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.439> means<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> we're

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
very exciting times it means that we're

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
very exciting times it means that we're
getting<00:01:23.580> pretty<00:01:23.790> close<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.630> perhaps<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> beta

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
getting pretty close to perhaps a beta

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.510 
getting pretty close to perhaps a beta
will<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.000> open<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.720> seriously<00:01:28.380> doubt<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.950> but

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
will it be open I seriously doubt it but

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.179 
will it be open I seriously doubt it but
it's<00:01:29.880> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.329> disappointing<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.259> me<00:01:31.290> being

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's kind of disappointing to me being

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's kind of disappointing to me being
in<00:01:32.460> England<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.570> won't<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.049> eligible

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
in England that I won't be eligible

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
in England that I won't be eligible
because<00:01:34.740> they're<00:01:34.979> only<00:01:35.100> getting<00:01:35.220> people<00:01:35.610> from

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
because they're only getting people from

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.420 
because they're only getting people from
the<00:01:35.880> US<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.450> makes<00:01:36.840> sense<00:01:37.049> though<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the US it makes sense though because you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.710 
the US it makes sense though because you
know<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.030> their<00:01:39.180> servers<00:01:39.600> are

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
know that's where their servers are

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.630 
know that's where their servers are
based<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> test<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
based and they just want to test the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179 
based and they just want to test the
functionality<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.170> game<00:01:43.380> instead<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
functionality of the game instead of

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
functionality of the game instead of
stress<00:01:44.939> testing<00:01:45.420> their<00:01:45.570> servers<00:01:45.930> with

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
stress testing their servers with

stress testing their servers with
international<00:01:46.829> players<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.210> there's
