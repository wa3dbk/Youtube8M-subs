00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.849
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.740
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.290
 I brought a car camera 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 with which you film during the car ride 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.609
 you can just put them somewhere 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 the attitude depends on everything and that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.590
 the mgv 22.50 point hd hd stands for the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.840
 resolution in math hd resolution has ahead 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.630
 infrared diodes turn when we are there 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.669
 look there are the emotions so can 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 at night also up to ten meters far the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.550
 illuminate the scene 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 if you are right behind the glass 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.750
 you have to mount reflections there you have to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 know the lights go off this the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.460
 jews against the disc and blind the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.410
 chamber but otherwise it is correct 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.050
 even if it's so strange 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.390
 Looks like you're showing a display down here 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.270
 built-in so and this built-in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.000
 display that now shows the live image 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 what we see and what we do so naturally 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.149
 Of course you can also record with 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.239
 volume 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.680
 if I always go closer now 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.340
 that's how it is now 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.570
 live image in hd resolution so and this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.549
 full hd cockpit camera as it is called there 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.210
 I can go in different menus 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.670
 can do a lot of resolution loop 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.380
 recording so I take up 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.299
 can set the recordings like 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.070
 long she should take a scene because 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.290
 she has a motion detection can 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.079
 reactivate yourself afterwards 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.970
 You can not really do that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.250
 make continuous recordings but 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.930
 a maximum of ten minutes a greater time 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.820
 you can not stop and then 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 Are you waiting for the next move? 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 yes in the car is always given 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.360
 we have the possibility also pictures 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.430
 take up to 12 megapixel maximum 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.549
 resolution that is of course interpolated 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.630
 and not native and that 's the thing 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.579
 actually ideal 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.100
 now you could say that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.659
 opening angle of it 120 degrees still short 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.159
 interposed one could now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.009
 say how do I do it with the term 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.560
 good battery is built in but there is also 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.690
 There are still a lot of accessories once there 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.530
 here this sauknapp 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.700
 I can then as much as I like 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 turn there does not make such a noise 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.860
 the camera adjust quasi then hang 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.750
 is a usb connection cable here for the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.910
 The computer must be able to transfer the data 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.020
 memory card he can by the way to 32 gb 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.940
 and a car connection cable that will be in 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.610
 car outlet plugged other side in 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.450
 the camera runtime is infinite and mother 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.470
 the camera makes hd and one 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.820
 hdmi output will also be equal 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.740
 cable is included as you can 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.390
 Pictures if it is recorded then too 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.790
 on your TV or display too 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.650
 to see the house directly from the camera 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.150
 played so nice steahel 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.150
 ideal for the holidays and bye
