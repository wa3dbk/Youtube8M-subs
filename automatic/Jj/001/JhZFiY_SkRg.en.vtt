 of course all these glitches two is 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.030
 find video so in this video 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.380
 I present you it's not you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 explain how to install modes 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.640
 in minecraft pocket edition 0.91 0.10 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.900
 for four years earlier so that's so 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
 we will immediately started so all 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.320
 first you will need a mode that you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.359
 want to have so it depends which one we 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.140
 far to judge you move I've got you 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 rather choose the toumani theme that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.730
 is this mode that you see here so I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.590
 you will put the distribution link 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.890
 of the mode and you will download it 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.160
 it's all very simple so you see 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 here for 18 preview forum 0.10 for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.840
 click on them like this is fine 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 sure to download it so we wait a little 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.739
 once it's done click on 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 the download button so here in full 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 middle game was responsible for the crimes 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.500
 So it's just two seconds 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 I start I download you do 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.380
 ok here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 and suddenly it will download it 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.439
 must it be done you have your turn 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.110
 in games 18 preview you click it 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.240
 or does installer finally it's like 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.040
 you want to make yourself an installer or 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.369
 other applications to analyze it 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.200
 avenge do installer and that you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.759
 so install it to install it yourself 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.020
 tell m as this you go in 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.479
 unknown sources and you do ok 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.180
 like this once it's done 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.399
 it is but I have no news 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.770
 authorization 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.689
 so suddenly you settled 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 so I already made the game seems 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.320
 install another all manidem 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.479
 so me as I already did we will 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.040
 return directly from block block ensher 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.740
 it will just be a little bit 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.990
 the other way around I think I think it will be 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.700
 in green for you I do not know 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.090
 so suddenly we go on hunter loop 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.600
 so I'm sorry if it's upside down 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.630
 and you have a kind of little small 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.970
 keys like these garage and you 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.580
 clicked on it and so you 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.310
 see here launcher options stay arc 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.220
 who raid you the keys on you go 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.650
 danger real area and you will see 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.640
 toumani themes and until kruth and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.410
 on it and it should even be enabled 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.790
 or so if he does not see who 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.610
 update it is activated so you 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.580
 must also click on the top so 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.720
 so for those who would not 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.019
 not block 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.790
 finally block launcher I'll do you 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.630

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.670

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.110
