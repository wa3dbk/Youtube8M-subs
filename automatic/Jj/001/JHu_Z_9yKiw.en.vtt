00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.200
 I will open many thanks for these minutes 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.870
 for univision for thanks to you 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.560
 what balance did you do after the 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.050
 participation in the world 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.290
 Well, rest assured by the 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.789
 operation and by the things made of 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.210
 the selection 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 because we deliver ourselves to the maximum every 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.810
 every match we add 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.810
 Because we 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.490
 the circumstances did not want or not 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.380
 they gave for us to move forward 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.650
 that's why we're going quiet 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.079
 because we live the maximum of 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.239
 decisions of others 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.210
 but the truth is that it is what has 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.530
 Miguel Rl is someone who works very 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 well the document 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.969
 not football what the court touches 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.180
 but he is also a person who is very 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.830
 open and very 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.740
 the player gives me a lot of confidence 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.070
 so 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.160
 that's the way the player 's 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.220
 return all that confidence to Miguel 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.630
 inside the court to kill yourself running 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.759
 to jump but so many balls 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.590
 it's a way of thanking the average 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.079
 the confidence that gives us tell us how 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.979
 has been your reception here in the america 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.649
 good very good the truth that is a 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.610
 pretty good group also the people 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.610
 he has received the hobby well 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.020
 I am very grateful only to tell 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.079
 all those visions 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 the institution that will see the video of 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.190
 whenever it is delivered it is marked that 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.940
 fight every ball 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.940
 why 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.480
 and now you've been twice very 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.340
 close to getting the championship of 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.630
 volley or would you like here with the team 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.830
 of the help I would like because I know what 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.230
 the most amount of goals game 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.050
 collaborate so that for the team 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.010
 be in the top positions 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.000
 it's something that does not obsess me 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.560
 is something 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.080
 they are champions some problems 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.710
 significant but I am more interested in 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.710
 championships 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.270
 the team work did not get is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.780
 the most important challenge in his career to 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.780
 club level 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.440
 so it represents that building 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.020
 is to try to take it as quality but 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.490
 Much has been said about your departure from 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.920
 after the people of torreÃ³n how has 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.900
 received that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.099
 and it cost me it hurt 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.099
 but I am a professional 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.220
 We made the decision 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.640
 oliver thank you again one 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.640
