00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
thing the most important thing was the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.970 
thing the most important thing was the
impact<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> subs<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.349> went<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> just

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
impact of the subs that went on I just

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.430 
impact of the subs that went on I just
felt<00:00:14.130> all<00:00:14.280> three<00:00:14.610> help<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.900> back<00:00:16.080> into<00:00:16.289> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
felt all three help to get back into the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.750 
felt all three help to get back into the
game<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.740> gives<00:00:16.949> up<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> little<00:00:17.369> bit<00:00:17.460> more<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
game just gives up a little bit more of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.750 
game just gives up a little bit more of
a<00:00:17.820> lift<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> end<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.830> think<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.580> sort

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a lift and in the end we I think we sort

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.490 
a lift and in the end we I think we sort
of<00:00:20.850> deserved<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> win<00:00:21.480> probably<00:00:22.260> had<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of deserved the win probably had the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
of deserved the win probably had the
three<00:00:22.740> best<00:00:22.920> chances<00:00:23.430> i<00:00:23.550> think<00:00:23.730> McGugan<00:00:24.210> in

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
three best chances i think McGugan in

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.929 
three best chances i think McGugan in
the<00:00:24.420> first<00:00:24.660> half<00:00:24.960> keiran<00:00:25.859> lee<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.340> then<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the first half keiran lee and then I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.189 
the first half keiran lee and then I
think<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.210> he<00:00:27.359> said<00:00:27.510> are<00:00:27.630> there<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
think as he said are there but the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.689 
think as he said are there but the
credits<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> boys<00:00:29.010> they<00:00:29.189> kept<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
credits the boys they kept going and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.339 
credits the boys they kept going and
going<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.150> let's<00:00:30.840> start<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
going and going let's start with the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.990 
going and going let's start with the
five<00:00:31.619> minutes<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.040> keivan<00:00:32.640> Lavery

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
five minutes to go keivan Lavery

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
five minutes to go keivan Lavery
equalizers<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> guess<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.320> point<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
equalizers I guess at that point you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.049 
equalizers I guess at that point you
thinking<00:00:35.130> we've<00:00:35.250> we've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> point<00:00:35.880> from

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
thinking we've we've got a point from

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.430 
thinking we've we've got a point from
this<00:00:36.239> game<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> drama

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this game and that's when the drama

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.500 
this game and that's when the drama
started<00:00:37.760> well<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> annoying<00:00:39.180> thing

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
started well that's the annoying thing

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
started well that's the annoying thing
is<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:39.870> she<00:00:40.020> suddenly<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.559> score<00:00:40.829> our

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
is because she suddenly you score our

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
is because she suddenly you score our

time<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> runs<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
time in the runs and I think as he was a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.200 
time in the runs and I think as he was a
bit<00:01:25.950> unlucky<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> get<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> headers<00:01:27.060> from

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bit unlucky not to get to headers from

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
bit unlucky not to get to headers from
from<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> set<00:01:27.930> plays<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.350> from<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.920> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
from to set plays from from a good but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
from to set plays from from a good but
again<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:29.820> Louis<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.299> showed<00:01:30.509> all

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
again I think Louis just showed all

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.039 
again I think Louis just showed all
round<00:01:31.259> his<00:01:31.439> qualities<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.340> Bora<00:01:32.850> tension<00:01:33.390> he

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
round his qualities is Bora tension he

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.539 
round his qualities is Bora tension he
can<00:01:34.200> pick<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> pass<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:35.220> said<00:01:35.369> in

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
can pick out a pass like I've said in

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.910 
can pick out a pass like I've said in
his<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.290> overall<00:01:37.680> team

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
his but the but it's an overall team

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
his but the but it's an overall team
performance<00:01:38.430> again<00:01:38.909> when<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.420> went<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
performance again when when we went to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
performance again when when we went to
one<00:01:39.900> down<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.130> crumbled<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
one down we could have crumbled but we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.639 
one down we could have crumbled but we
didn't<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.390> stuck<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.229> we've<00:01:43.530> got

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
didn't we stuck in there and we've got

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.870 
didn't we stuck in there and we've got
the<00:01:43.770> three<00:01:43.950> points<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> your

you suddenly found a bit of energy to do

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.090 
you suddenly found a bit of energy to do
that<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.259> would<00:01:58.380> imagine<00:01:58.560> Kieran's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that because I would imagine Kieran's

that<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.800> position<00:02:26.010> says<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> lot<00:02:26.730> about<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that in that position says a lot about a

that in that position says a lot about a
team<00:02:27.209> rather<00:02:28.140> than<00:02:28.230> today<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> strong<00:02:28.920> physical

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
team rather than today a strong physical

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.040 
team rather than today a strong physical
side<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> was<00:02:30.120> probably<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> mismatch<00:02:30.780> at

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
side with it was probably a mismatch at

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.559 
side with it was probably a mismatch at
the<00:02:31.650> picking<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.550> set<00:02:32.730> plays<00:02:32.970> height<00:02:33.300> wise

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
the picking up at set plays height wise

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.479 
the picking up at set plays height wise
but<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.200> most<00:02:34.350> important<00:02:34.800> thing<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.310> there

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
but the most important thing is is there

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.400 
but the most important thing is is there
in<00:02:35.580> your<00:02:35.700> face<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.270> they<00:02:36.360> keep<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> ball

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
in your face and they keep the ball

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.199 
in your face and they keep the ball
alive<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.580> could<00:02:38.730> try<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:38.970> keep<00:02:39.060> it

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
alive and and they could try and keep it

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.699 
alive and and they could try and keep it
in<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.390> box<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.110> turn<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.440> know<00:02:40.470> play

in the box and they turn you know play

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.530 
in the box and they turn you know play
to<00:02:40.770> their<00:02:40.980> strengths<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.910> had<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.239> stuck<00:02:42.450> we

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
to their strengths we had to be stuck we

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.150 
to their strengths we had to be stuck we
have<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.720> stand<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:43.020> be<00:02:43.140> counted<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.709> wasn't<00:02:44.040> it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.610 
of pressure without them really have any
clear-cut<00:02:59.790> clear-cut<00:03:00.510> chances<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.200> I'll

pass him with it because the forced

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.790 
pass him with it because the forced
errors<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.090> was<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> passing<00:03:03.959> by<00:03:04.500> said<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.850 
I thought second half we did that a lot
better
