you're going to need a non-stick pan I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.630 
you're going to need a non-stick pan I
say<00:00:14.900> nonstick<00:00:15.500> because<00:00:15.830> you're<00:00:16.370> going<00:00:16.550> to

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
say nonstick because you're going to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.850 
say nonstick because you're going to
mess<00:00:16.790> up<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.060> nonce<00:00:17.270> expand<00:00:17.960> simply<00:00:18.680> because

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
mess up the nonce expand simply because

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.100 
mess up the nonce expand simply because
we're<00:00:19.160> doing<00:00:19.310> a<00:00:19.340> lot<00:00:19.490> of<00:00:19.550> whisking<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.180> added<00:00:20.960> in

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
we're doing a lot of whisking I added in

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.400 
we're doing a lot of whisking I added in
some<00:00:21.170> sugar<00:00:22.010> I'm<00:00:22.280> now<00:00:22.430> adding<00:00:22.670> my<00:00:23.030> salt<00:00:23.420> you're

also going to need some ground nutmeg

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.930 
also going to need some ground nutmeg
and<00:00:27.020> of<00:00:27.830> course<00:00:28.100> you're<00:00:28.370> going<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:28.700> need<00:00:28.910> some

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
and of course you're going to need some

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.810 
and of course you're going to need some
cornstarch<00:00:29.920> so<00:00:30.920> once<00:00:31.130> everything<00:00:31.610> is<00:00:31.640> in

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
cornstarch so once everything is in

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.459 
cornstarch so once everything is in
there<00:00:32.059> we<00:00:32.329> are<00:00:32.540> going<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.989> mix<00:00:33.200> everything

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
there we are going to mix everything

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.490 
there we are going to mix everything
until<00:00:34.070> well<00:00:34.520> combined<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.540> now<00:00:36.140> we're<00:00:36.350> going

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
until well combined and now we're going

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.709 
until well combined and now we're going
to<00:00:36.620> start<00:00:36.920> pouring<00:00:37.370> in<00:00:37.520> some<00:00:37.969> milk<00:00:38.270> I'm<00:00:38.450> using

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
to start pouring in some milk I'm using

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.660 
to start pouring in some milk I'm using
whole<00:00:39.050> milk<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.829> can<00:00:39.980> definitely<00:00:40.370> use

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
whole milk but you can definitely use

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.259 
whole milk but you can definitely use
two<00:00:41.239> percent<00:00:42.429> once<00:00:43.429> the<00:00:43.609> milk<00:00:43.789> is<00:00:43.940> in<00:00:43.969> there

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
two percent once the milk is in there

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.090 
two percent once the milk is in there
make<00:00:44.449> sure<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.839> whisk<00:00:45.109> continuously<00:00:45.769> and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
make sure you whisk continuously and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.860 
make sure you whisk continuously and
then<00:00:46.850> we're<00:00:46.969> going<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.179> turn<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.510> heat<00:00:47.690> up<00:00:47.719> to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
then we're going to turn the heat up to

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.189 
then we're going to turn the heat up to
medium<00:00:48.519> let<00:00:49.519> this<00:00:49.670> mixture<00:00:49.999> cook<00:00:50.300> over<00:00:50.749> medium

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
medium let this mixture cook over medium

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.290 
medium let this mixture cook over medium
heat<00:00:51.350> for<00:00:51.409> about<00:00:51.620> 10<00:00:52.010> minutes<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:53.120> we're

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
heat for about 10 minutes and now we're

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.020 
heat for about 10 minutes and now we're
going<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.539> dish<00:00:53.809> out<00:00:54.190> about<00:00:55.190> two-thirds<00:00:55.730> cup

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
going to dish out about two-thirds cup

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.899 
going to dish out about two-thirds cup
of<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.329> hot<00:00:56.510> mixture<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.129> heat<00:00:58.339> should

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
of that hot mixture so the heat should

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.389 
of that hot mixture so the heat should
be<00:00:59.120> on<00:00:59.300> about<00:01:00.079> low<00:01:00.289> at<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:00.589> time<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.100> here<00:01:01.219> we

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
be on about low at this time and here we

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.430 
be on about low at this time and here we
have<00:01:01.550> three<00:01:01.909> eggs<00:01:02.149> we're<00:01:02.899> going<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.199> lightly

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
have three eggs we're going to lightly

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.750 
have three eggs we're going to lightly
beat<00:01:03.769> them<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.129> we're<00:01:04.250> going<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.489> slowly

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
beat them and we're going to slowly

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.090 
beat them and we're going to slowly
start<00:01:04.970> pouring<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.810> hot<00:01:06.050> mixture<00:01:06.440> this

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
start pouring in that hot mixture this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.280 
start pouring in that hot mixture this
brings<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.490> temperature<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.570> eggs<00:01:08.750> up<00:01:09.050> so

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
brings the temperature of the eggs up so

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.590 
brings the temperature of the eggs up so
when<00:01:09.440> we<00:01:09.530> do<00:01:09.710> add<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.010> eggs<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.460> our<00:01:10.670> pan<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
when we do add the eggs to our pan the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.060 
when we do add the eggs to our pan the
eggs<00:01:11.780> will<00:01:11.960> not<00:01:12.079> scramble<00:01:12.560> or<00:01:12.740> cook<00:01:12.950> or

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
eggs will not scramble or cook or

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.889 
eggs will not scramble or cook or
anything<00:01:13.340> like<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:14.540> we're<00:01:14.689> going<00:01:14.810> to

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899
