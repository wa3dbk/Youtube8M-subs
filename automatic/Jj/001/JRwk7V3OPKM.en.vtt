00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
go really well under a foundation but

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.169 
go really well under a foundation but
what<00:01:17.709> I<00:01:17.740> found<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.429> sort<00:01:18.789> of<00:01:18.939> quite

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
what I found this it's sort of quite

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.319 
what I found this it's sort of quite
buildable<00:01:19.569> so<00:01:20.499> that<00:01:20.799> yes<00:01:21.219> I<00:01:21.429> still<00:01:21.639> will<00:01:21.850> use<00:01:22.119> a

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
buildable so that yes I still will use a

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.699 
buildable so that yes I still will use a
concealer<00:01:23.229> with<00:01:23.499> it<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.319> can<00:01:26.499> kind<00:01:26.679> of

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
concealer with it but you can kind of

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.649 
concealer with it but you can kind of
work<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.159> into<00:01:27.279> the<00:01:27.369> skin<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:27.969> just<00:01:28.270> looks

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
work it into the skin and it just looks

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.789 
work it into the skin and it just looks
quite<00:01:28.959> dewy<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:31.079> nicely<00:01:32.079> put<00:01:32.409> together<00:01:32.560> I

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
quite dewy and nicely put together I

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.910 
quite dewy and nicely put together I
think<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.689> can<00:01:34.990> only<00:01:35.229> get<00:01:35.469> it<00:01:35.590> in<00:01:35.649> three

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
think you can only get it in three

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.919 
think you can only get it in three
shades<00:01:36.189> which<00:01:36.459> is<00:01:36.609> slightly<00:01:36.880> annoying<00:01:37.209> you

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
shades which is slightly annoying you

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.089 
shades which is slightly annoying you
can<00:01:38.020> get<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.259> in<00:01:38.380> light<00:01:38.619> medium<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.459> deep<00:01:39.700> and

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:41.099 
can get it in light medium and deep and

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.589 
can get it in light medium and deep and
the<00:01:42.099> light<00:01:42.249> is<00:01:42.459> sort<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.789> almost<00:01:43.179> too<00:01:43.420> light

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
the light is sort of almost too light

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.230 
the light is sort of almost too light
for<00:01:43.630> me<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.679> medium<00:01:45.039> is<00:01:45.159> quite<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.549> big<00:01:45.909> jump

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
for me the medium is quite a big jump

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.929 
for me the medium is quite a big jump
from<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:46.899> light<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.319> I<00:01:47.859> haven't<00:01:48.340> tried<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
from the light and I haven't tried the

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.519 
from the light and I haven't tried the
deep<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:49.479> I'm<00:01:49.630> assuming<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.139> not<00:01:50.169> going<00:01:50.469> to

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:50.529 
deep but I'm assuming it's not going to

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:56.069 
deep but I'm assuming it's not going to
cover<00:01:51.179> everyone<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:54.009> think<00:01:54.789> I<00:01:55.060> hope<00:01:55.299> that

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
cover everyone so I think I hope that

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.330 
cover everyone so I think I hope that
they'll<00:01:56.229> bring<00:01:56.349> out<00:01:56.499> more<00:01:56.709> colors<00:01:57.009> if<00:01:57.189> you've

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
they'll bring out more colors if you've

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.519 
they'll bring out more colors if you've
got<00:01:57.520> loads<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.849> money<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.569> can<00:01:58.719> buy<00:01:58.899> two<00:01:58.959> and

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529 
got loads of money you can buy two and

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:02.639 
got loads of money you can buy two and
mix<00:01:59.919> them<00:02:00.099> together<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:01.359> don't<00:02:01.779> so<00:02:02.259> I've

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
mix them together and I don't so I've

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.719 
mix them together and I don't so I've
got<00:02:02.859> lights<00:02:03.099> and<00:02:03.369> actually<00:02:03.880> it's<00:02:04.479> fine<00:02:04.810> but

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
got lights and actually it's fine but

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.859 
got lights and actually it's fine but
you<00:02:06.729> know<00:02:06.849> I'd<00:02:07.209> like<00:02:07.389> something<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.810> between

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
you know I'd like something in between

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.839 
you know I'd like something in between
light<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.229> medium<00:02:08.500> for<00:02:08.800> my<00:02:08.890> skin<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.610> I'm

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
light and medium for my skin and I'm

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.610 
light and medium for my skin and I'm
pretty<00:02:10.119> sure<00:02:10.209> there'll<00:02:11.110> be<00:02:11.170> lots<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.530> people

you know I think I probably will buy it
again<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.820> feel<00:02:58.000> like<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.540> was<00:03:01.660> 30

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
again but I just feel like if it was 30

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.010 
again but I just feel like if it was 30
pounds<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.940> 20<00:03:03.940> something<00:03:04.390> pounds<00:03:04.600> even<00:03:04.840> if

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
pounds or 20 something pounds even if

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.170 
pounds or 20 something pounds even if
it's<00:03:05.140> $29.99<00:03:06.130> which<00:03:06.459> they<00:03:06.640> never<00:03:06.820> price

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
it's $29.99 which they never price

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's $29.99 which they never price
foundations<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:10.870> feel<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> bit<00:03:11.440> better

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
foundations at I would feel a bit better

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.520 
foundations at I would feel a bit better
about<00:03:12.450> spending<00:03:13.450> my<00:03:13.630> money<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.140> because

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
about spending my money on it because

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.040 
about spending my money on it because
it's<00:03:14.860> not<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> foundation<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.780> skin

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
it's not a foundation it's a skin

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.690 
it's not a foundation it's a skin
corrector<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.550> has<00:03:18.730> an<00:03:18.880> SPF<00:03:19.330> of<00:03:19.420> 30<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:20.020> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
corrector so this has an SPF of 30 in it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.949 
corrector so this has an SPF of 30 in it
so<00:03:21.700> I'm<00:03:21.940> not<00:03:22.120> sure<00:03:22.269> how<00:03:22.480> well<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.870> will

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
so I'm not sure how well it will

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.490 
so I'm not sure how well it will
photograph<00:03:24.360> because<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.510> SPF<00:03:25.900> will<00:03:26.140> probably

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
photograph because the SPF will probably

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.479 
photograph because the SPF will probably
flash<00:03:26.769> back<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.040> something<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.370> be

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
flash back so that is something to be

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.920 
flash back so that is something to be
aware<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:37.000> as<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.330> can<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.600> I'm<00:03:37.750> working

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
aware of so as you can see I'm working

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:51.610 
aware of so as you can see I'm working
this<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.350> really<00:03:38.860> well<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.519> needs<00:03:42.700> it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.660 

but<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:52.860> will<00:03:52.950> give<00:03:53.099> already<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.550> just
