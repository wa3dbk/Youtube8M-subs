it<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.909> lot<00:02:00.030> freely<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:00.900> saves<00:02:01.110> energy

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it just a lot freely and it saves energy

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.680 
it just a lot freely and it saves energy
avoids<00:02:01.860> cramps<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:03.180> cool<00:02:03.330> stuff<00:02:03.360> like

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
parallel to the grain so you when your

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 
parallel to the grain so you when your
needs<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.190> right<00:02:08.399> angles<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.599> want

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
needs to be at right angles you want

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
flat on the pedals you know with no

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.289 
flat on the pedals you know with no
hassle<00:02:14.099> at<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.519> don't<00:02:14.610> any<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
hassle at all you don't any of that

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.750 
hassle at all you don't any of that
get<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.430> once<00:02:17.430> you've<00:02:17.519> got<00:02:17.640> that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
get in the way and once you've got that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
get in the way and once you've got that
then<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.269> should<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.480> able<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.629> learn<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
then you should be able to learn and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.899 
then you should be able to learn and
play<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.310> lot<00:02:20.670> easier<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:23.190> heel-toe<00:02:23.519> technique

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
play a lot easier the heel-toe technique

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.429 
play a lot easier the heel-toe technique
is<00:02:24.090> made<00:02:24.299> from<00:02:24.450> two<00:02:24.689> different<00:02:24.840> motions<00:02:25.319> of

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
is made from two different motions of

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.130 
is made from two different motions of
the<00:02:25.529> foot<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.099> got<00:02:26.219> your<00:02:26.370> heel<00:02:26.519> up<00:02:26.549> technique

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
the foot you got your heel up technique

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.210 
the foot you got your heel up technique
and<00:02:29.140> he'll<00:02:29.590> bang<00:02:31.680> basically<00:02:32.680> what<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.100> is

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
and he'll bang basically what I do is

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.560 
and he'll bang basically what I do is
combine<00:02:33.370> both<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.760> those<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.150> same<00:02:34.330> time

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
combine both of those at the same time

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.870 
combine both of those at the same time
so<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.230> get<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> stamp<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.190> motion<00:02:38.880> I'm

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
so you get like a stamp in motion I'm

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.460 
so you get like a stamp in motion I'm
keeping<00:02:40.210> my<00:02:40.330> toe<00:02:40.390> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.870> top<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> pedal

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
keeping my toe on the top of the pedal

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.740 
keeping my toe on the top of the pedal
of<00:02:41.530> control<00:02:41.860> at<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.340> banks<00:02:42.640> but<00:02:42.820> if<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.150> just

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
of control at the banks but if you just

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.330 
of control at the banks but if you just
loosen<00:02:44.050> up<00:02:44.080> your<00:02:44.200> toes<00:02:44.440> bring<00:02:44.890> them<00:02:45.100> off<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
loosen up your toes bring them off the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.640 
loosen up your toes bring them off the
board<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:45.910> bit<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:47.350> can<00:02:47.500> get<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
board a little bit you can you can get a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.000 
board a little bit you can you can get a
banks<00:02:47.980> motion<00:02:48.310> going<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:53.320> know<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.680> once

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
banks motion going you know and once

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.130 
banks motion going you know and once
that<00:02:54.190> second<00:02:54.520> hit<00:02:54.640> has<00:02:54.760> been<00:02:54.940> stroke<00:02:55.840> then<00:02:56.080> you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
that second hit has been stroke then you

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:15.240 
that second hit has been stroke then you
can<00:02:56.290> bring<00:02:56.410> your<00:02:56.500> toes<00:02:56.680> down<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:15.010> like<00:03:15.070> a

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
can bring your toes down it's like a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.000 
can bring your toes down it's like a
motion<00:03:16.380> imagine<00:03:17.380> there's<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.530> pivot<00:03:17.710> in<00:03:17.920> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
motion imagine there's a pivot in the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.050 
motion imagine there's a pivot in the
middle<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.340> foot<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:18.940> want<00:03:19.120> to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
middle of your foot and you just want to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.340 
middle of your foot and you just want to
just<00:03:22.060> keep<00:03:22.240> that<00:03:22.360> going<00:03:22.570> obviously<00:03:23.290> it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
just keep that going obviously it

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.720 
just keep that going obviously it
doesn't<00:03:23.470> sound<00:03:23.650> good<00:03:23.830> when<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.130> slow<00:03:24.400> that's

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
doesn't sound good when it's slow that's

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:52.070 
doesn't sound good when it's slow that's
what<00:03:24.850> singles<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:50.190> could<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.430> start

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
what singles so you could be to start

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.180 
what singles so you could be to start
practicing<00:03:53.080> with<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.590> motion<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:54.100> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
practicing with that motion is the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:33.430 
practicing with that motion is the
normal<00:03:54.490> eight<00:03:54.670> feet<00:03:54.940> so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440
