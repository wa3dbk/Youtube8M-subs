00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820
 diantre the fish 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.150
 all these products his cook on board 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.460
 the captain smashes 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.429
 and to whet your appetite I propose you in images in this case the recipe 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.429
 from his host to erdf account 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.879
 you will see it's a simple recipe it's very beautiful to taste 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.440
 let's see this recipe for dark range closer 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 first of all the ingredients then there let go on the zergs one can 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.460
 imagine 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 the recipe with a multitude of varieties of club calls from the dais 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 we will be able to put purple basil and flat parsley 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.270
 fresh coriander a little tip asks why not 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.270
 then once a salmon assault my account had 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.580
 the ingredients of the marinade this will be 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.680
 old-fashioned mustard 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.780
 a complaint of no tons of rice for spices for the perfume for the time 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.820
 the trip a little bit of this framework 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 a pinch 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.470
 of the sky and pepper for the garnish we'll have 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.510
 a sweet potato 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.490
 and the world 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.259
 firstly we will prepare the marina we will put the mustard to the old 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.820
 then 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.130
 the little point 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.310
 of tenghory 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.180
 the past two or three 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 of curious 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330
 salt 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.470
 the pepper 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.010
 and turn mix with m 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 a little bit more 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.260
 no more added 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.650
 a perfect 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.340
 in which m 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.130
 I'm going marini 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.690
 good not negotiable 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 we are ready 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.670
 but at least we have right on each side 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 so that all its flavors are imbued 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.950
 we will leave him in the last moments 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.970
 the weather 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.970
 for us to prepare Russian agencies 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.240
 so for this mixture of herbs 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.109
 we want to use as I told him 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.479
 different varieties for example never a little disappointing 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.929
 not too much because strasbourg petunia very much slower 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.049
 we will put 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.049
 some beautiful leaves 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.209
 they also promise 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.299
 so you have to ask 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.989
 and now it's a good tail car to chisel them that is to say the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.679
 cut 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.890
 but without messing up 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.910
 the amossois h 30 because they lose at that moment all their flavor 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.659
 we will be able to 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.089
 on our picture 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.069
 he means to mix them 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.999
 the robin season 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.429
 this part of the summit 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.669
 cholet by the marinade 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.959
 now the sweet potato 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.069
 we will try it 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.469
 let's start with hole I prefer to help in the field two to three 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.950
 centimeters of side 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.899
 m 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.430
 obama and that now we put it in the pan 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.649
 covered with cold 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.459
 a hint of salt 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.719
 and a leather during 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.719
 about 30 minutes 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.619
 know it now we're going to cook it 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.629
 so it will take for that a dish in the oven a roasting dish 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.739
 we will have 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.759
 other salmon steak 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.989
 it must be money and now we will put it in the oven for 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.609
 eight minutes in a half-blood lime kiln 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.609
 in order to grab it and have a justin pink cooking 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:41.939
 so here are our items cooked 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.860
 the salmon see perotti and the sweet potato is also 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.109
 direct 8 melt 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.689
 we will have 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.649
 the salmon 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.279
 on the plate 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.329
 we will now 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.869
 drain 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.479
 your sweet potatoes 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.939
 Toulon will crush 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.229
 with clermont I do not care about happiness 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.069
 a promise 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.559
 on the plate 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.069
 dispose 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.069
 this sweet potato 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.129
 and finish now 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.009
 associated with the board is very simple 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.009
 in reality since it is also the other 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.900
 a little salt 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 a little pepper 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.340
 a teaspoon of oil from books 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.430
 - mix 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.580
 the whole to get smaller homogeneous sauce 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.719
 q 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.110
 we will have 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.110
 that's what it is 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.719
 it's the little thing besides it's going to be you're not so clear of 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.229
 reduced balsamic 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.639
 about our society 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.430
 all branches 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.110
 and that's banking 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.080
 she will be served to you on the smashed captain 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.009
 this date
