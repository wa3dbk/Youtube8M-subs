with two different canisters one inch of
insulation<00:00:20.420> provides<00:00:21.890> 6.7<00:00:23.000> rFactor<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
insulation provides 6.7 rFactor for the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.849 
insulation provides 6.7 rFactor for the
insulation<00:00:26.300> very<00:00:27.300> easy<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> use<00:00:28.140> from<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.740> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
warm enough up here the canisters need

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.210 
warm enough up here the canisters need
to<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> between<00:01:12.180> 60<00:01:12.900> degrees<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> 80<00:01:13.710> degrees

properly if the foam comes out green if
not<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.740> need<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> stop<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.520> warm<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.060> your

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
not you need to stop and warm up your

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
not you need to stop and warm up your
canisters<00:01:24.750> you'll<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> canisters<00:01:26.310> are

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
canisters you'll know the canisters are

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.179 
canisters you'll know the canisters are
the<00:01:26.580> proper<00:01:26.939> proper<00:01:27.689> temperature<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the proper proper temperature because a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.609 
the proper proper temperature because a
temperature<00:01:29.759> strip<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> provided<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.350> needs

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
temperature strip is provided it needs

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.469 
temperature strip is provided it needs
to<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> green<00:01:32.369> section<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.090> order<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
to be in the green section in order to

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.600 
to be in the green section in order to
use<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.049> notice<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.920> were<00:01:35.040> using<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
use I notice when we were using this

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
use I notice when we were using this
that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> could<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> temperature

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that you could not see the temperature

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
that you could not see the temperature
so<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.009> did<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.090> push<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.570> down

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so what we did we we just push this down

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.830 
so what we did we we just push this down
this<00:01:40.350> temperature<00:01:40.920> strip<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> voila<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.659> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this temperature strip and voila you can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.030 
this temperature strip and voila you can
see<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.470> comes<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> green<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
see it comes up in the green and here we

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.069 
see it comes up in the green and here we
are<00:01:47.180> here's<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> hose<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.780> comes<00:01:48.990> with

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
are here's the hose that it comes with

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.710 
are here's the hose that it comes with
we<00:01:49.770> had<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.340> canister<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> hoses

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
we had a a canister and the hoses

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
we had a a canister and the hoses
labeled<00:01:52.079> A<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.740> B<00:01:52.770> canister<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.850> labeled

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
labeled A and a B canister is labeled

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.120 
labeled A and a B canister is labeled
good<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:55.560> shook<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.219> 60<00:01:56.520> seconds<00:01:56.880> already

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
good we shook it for 60 seconds already

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
good we shook it for 60 seconds already
this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> nozzle<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.960> going

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this is the nozzle that will be going

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469 
this is the nozzle that will be going
that<00:02:01.590> we'll<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.890> using<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.460> first<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.270> need

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that we'll be using but first you need

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.459 
that we'll be using but first you need
to<00:02:03.509> apply<00:02:03.840> vaseline<00:02:04.560> around<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.850> o-ring<00:02:06.469> just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
to apply vaseline around the o-ring just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.740 
to apply vaseline around the o-ring just
like<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:09.420> generous<00:02:09.869> about<00:02:10.020> it
