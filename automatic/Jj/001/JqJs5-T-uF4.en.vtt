00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
entire race better than words that act

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.620 
entire race better than words that act
right<00:04:46.979> there<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.550> piece<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.910> movement

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
right there that that piece of movement

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.140 
right there that that piece of movement
and<00:04:49.190> spinning<00:04:50.190> out<00:04:50.340> into<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.700> first<00:04:50.910> corner

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
and spinning out into the first corner

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.000 
and spinning out into the first corner
but<00:04:51.300> anyway<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:52.290> are<00:04:52.410> going<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.620> try<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.890> hook

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
but anyway we are going to try and hook

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.140 
but anyway we are going to try and hook
together<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:54.950> good<00:04:55.950> second<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.550> third<00:04:56.820> sector

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
together a good second and third sector

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.550 
together a good second and third sector
let's<00:04:57.419> see<00:04:57.539> what<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.930> do<00:04:58.050> let's<00:04:58.080> see<00:04:58.380> if<00:04:58.440> we

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
let's see what we can do let's see if we

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.469 
let's see what we can do let's see if we
can<00:04:58.740> slide<00:04:59.039> through<00:04:59.340> casinos<00:04:59.910> Greg<00:05:00.210> right

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
can slide through casinos Greg right

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.330 
can slide through casinos Greg right
well<00:05:00.690> yes<00:05:01.410> we<00:05:01.560> can<00:05:01.770> advance

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
well yes we can advance

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.550 
well yes we can advance
slide<00:05:02.580> through<00:05:03.300> there<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.600> bit<00:05:03.870> too<00:05:04.139> well<00:05:04.410> in

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
slide through there a bit too well in

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.129 
slide through there a bit too well in
fact<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.010> we<00:05:05.040> have<00:05:05.720> we've<00:05:06.720> hit<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.960> wall

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
fact and we have we've hit the wall
