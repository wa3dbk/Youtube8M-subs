00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
good afternoon this is Tam Wendell with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750 
good afternoon this is Tam Wendell with
bushcraft<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.720> fire<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.230> happy<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.580> back

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
bushcraft on fire and happy to be back

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.689 
bushcraft on fire and happy to be back
with<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.180> again<00:00:21.439> today<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> would<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
with you again today I would like to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.870 
with you again today I would like to
share<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:24.930> experiment<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.949> cleaning

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
share with you an experiment on cleaning

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089 
share with you an experiment on cleaning
cast<00:00:27.480> iron<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> I've<00:00:28.140> had<00:00:28.349> people<00:00:28.560> asked<00:00:29.070> me

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cast iron and I've had people asked me

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.880 
cast iron and I've had people asked me
how<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> clean<00:00:30.630> cast<00:00:31.019> iron<00:00:31.320> when<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> looks

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
how do you clean cast iron when it looks

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.569 
how do you clean cast iron when it looks
like<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.340> has<00:00:32.460> been<00:00:32.489> destroyed<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.920> found<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
like it has been destroyed so we found a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.510 
like it has been destroyed so we found a
piece<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> cast<00:00:36.390> iron<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.960> definitely<00:00:37.860> looks

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
piece of cast iron that definitely looks

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.650 
piece of cast iron that definitely looks
destroyed<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.230> coated<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.430> wax<00:00:42.000> there's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
destroyed it is coated in wax there's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.010 
destroyed it is coated in wax there's
all<00:00:43.410> sorts<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> pitting<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.239> outside<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
all sorts of pitting on the outside I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.889 
all sorts of pitting on the outside I
don't<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.129> salvageable<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.120> it's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
don't know if it's salvageable but it's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.220 
don't know if it's salvageable but it's
definitely<00:00:49.160> cleanable<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> without<00:00:51.930> further

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
definitely cleanable so without further

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.549 
definitely cleanable so without further
ado<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:53.219> show<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.930> get<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.199> rust

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
ado I will show you how to get this rust

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.209 
ado I will show you how to get this rust
and<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.690> these<00:00:57.690> layers<00:00:58.050> baked<00:00:58.980> on

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and all of this these layers baked on

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.540 
and all of this these layers baked on
here<00:00:59.520> off<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.359> cast<00:01:00.750> iron<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> first

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
here off of this cast iron the first

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.090 
here off of this cast iron the first
step<00:01:02.820> I'm<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.799> use

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
step I'm going to do is to just use

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.260 
step I'm going to do is to just use
plain<00:01:05.840> household<00:01:06.840> vinegar<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> I'll<00:01:08.970> pour

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
plain household vinegar and I'll pour

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.800 
plain household vinegar and I'll pour
vinegar<00:01:10.700> into<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> pot<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> I'll<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.780> on

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
vinegar into the pot and I'll put on

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.620 
vinegar into the pot and I'll put on
some<00:01:16.140> gloves

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.709 

you

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.179 

I'm<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.499> to<00:01:26.619> use<00:01:26.859> some<00:01:27.850> crumpled<00:01:28.390> up

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'm going to use some crumpled up

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:46.580 
I'm going to use some crumpled up
aluminum<00:01:30.299> foil<00:01:31.299> as<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:32.670> scrubby<00:01:33.670> brush<00:01:37.500> make<00:01:38.500> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.620 

as<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.799> can<00:01:48.009> see<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.520> rust<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:51.509> starting<00:01:52.509> to

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
as you can see that rust is starting to

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.609 
as you can see that rust is starting to
come<00:01:52.810> loose<00:01:53.340> yeah<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.289> get<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.439> whole

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
come loose yeah it is to get the whole

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.559 
come loose yeah it is to get the whole
pan<00:01:56.920> outside<00:01:57.609> and<00:01:57.969> inside<00:01:58.860> totally<00:01:59.860> scrubbed

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
pan outside and inside totally scrubbed

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:08.749 
pan outside and inside totally scrubbed
and<00:02:01.569> then<00:02:01.719> we'll<00:02:01.869> move<00:02:01.959> on<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.349> the<00:02:02.439> next<00:02:02.590> step

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.190 

all<00:02:09.759> right<00:02:09.910> I've<00:02:10.030> been<00:02:10.209> working<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:10.989> for<00:02:11.140> a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
all right I've been working it for a

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280 
all right I've been working it for a
while<00:02:11.470> here<00:02:11.829> the<00:02:12.730> rust<00:02:13.000> has<00:02:13.209> got<00:02:13.510> into<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
while here the rust has got into the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.849 
while here the rust has got into the
cast<00:02:14.890> iron<00:02:15.190> pretty<00:02:15.579> deep<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.290> it's<00:02:17.410> taking<00:02:17.769> a

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
cast iron pretty deep so it's taking a

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.920 
cast iron pretty deep so it's taking a
bunch<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.190> elbow<00:02:18.549> grease<00:02:18.579> as<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.329> can<00:02:19.510> see<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
bunch of elbow grease as you can see the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.160 
bunch of elbow grease as you can see the
foil<00:02:20.650> gets<00:02:21.010> rock-hard<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.180> once<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.900> come<00:02:23.140> to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
foil gets rock-hard and once you come to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.110 
foil gets rock-hard and once you come to
a<00:02:23.349> point<00:02:23.560> where<00:02:23.799> there's<00:02:23.980> no<00:02:24.190> more<00:02:24.400> rough

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
a point where there's no more rough

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.080 
a point where there's no more rough
edges<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.810> scrub<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:27.370> get<00:02:27.549> yourself<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
edges to scrub with just get yourself a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:46.590 
edges to scrub with just get yourself a
new<00:02:28.349> ball<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.500> foil

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.150 

some<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.780> rest<00:02:47.990> is<00:02:48.230> coming<00:02:48.650> loose<00:02:48.830> along

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
some of the rest is coming loose along

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.050 
some of the rest is coming loose along
the<00:02:49.310> edges<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.680> once<00:02:51.890> I've<00:02:52.100> I'm<00:02:52.700> happy

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the edges here so once I've I'm happy

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.240 
the edges here so once I've I'm happy
with<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.960> amount<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.260> rust<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.620> pulled<00:02:54.890> off<00:02:55.070> on

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
with the amount of rust I pulled off on

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.520 
with the amount of rust I pulled off on
this<00:02:55.400> inside<00:02:56.270> I'm<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.080> flip<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.320> over

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
this inside I'm going to flip it over

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:09.400 
this inside I'm going to flip it over
and<00:02:57.830> do<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.040> outside<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.610> pan<00:03:08.410> that's

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
and do the outside of the pan that's

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.880 
and do the outside of the pan that's
outside<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.520> can<00:03:10.730> see<00:03:10.760> here<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.420> very<00:03:12.290> deeply

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
outside you can see here is very deeply

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.340 
outside you can see here is very deeply
pitted<00:03:13.280> there's<00:03:13.520> actually<00:03:14.150> little<00:03:14.840> pockets

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
pitted there's actually little pockets

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.460 
pitted there's actually little pockets
that<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.940> cast<00:03:17.210> iron<00:03:17.480> has<00:03:17.750> come<00:03:17.990> off<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that have the cast iron has come off of

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.220 
that have the cast iron has come off of
it<00:03:19.240> but<00:03:20.240> we're<00:03:20.390> not<00:03:20.420> gonna<00:03:20.630> give<00:03:20.870> up<00:03:21.020> we'll

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
it but we're not gonna give up we'll

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.190 
it but we're not gonna give up we'll
just<00:03:21.440> keep<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.890> scrubbing<00:03:22.810> get<00:03:23.810> as<00:03:23.990> much<00:03:24.140> of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
just keep on scrubbing get as much of

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.370 
just keep on scrubbing get as much of
this<00:03:24.470> surface<00:03:25.430> rust<00:03:26.390> as<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.750> can<00:03:27.020> and<00:03:27.290> then

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
this surface rust as I can and then

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:40.240 
this surface rust as I can and then
we'll<00:03:27.500> move<00:03:27.650> down<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> deep<00:03:28.790> crust<00:03:39.250> okay

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
we'll move down to a deep crust okay

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.710 
we'll move down to a deep crust okay
I've<00:03:40.400> got<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.410> pan<00:03:42.410> here<00:03:42.910> as<00:03:43.910> far<00:03:44.180> down<00:03:44.209> as<00:03:44.420> I

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
I've got the pan here as far down as I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.230 
I've got the pan here as far down as I
can<00:03:44.959> see<00:03:45.200> obviously<00:03:45.740> it's<00:03:45.980> pretty<00:03:46.310> filthy

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
can see obviously it's pretty filthy

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.260 
can see obviously it's pretty filthy
looking<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:48.680> I'm<00:03:48.800> going<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.010> do<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.490> dunk

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
looking so what I'm going to do is dunk

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.560 
looking so what I'm going to do is dunk
it<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.540> water<00:03:50.570> which<00:03:51.110> typically<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:52.250> don't

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
it in water which typically you don't

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.140 
it in water which typically you don't
leave<00:03:53.570> your<00:03:53.720> cast<00:03:53.990> iron<00:03:54.260> in<00:03:54.500> water<00:03:55.090> I'm<00:03:56.090> not

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
leave your cast iron in water I'm not

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.720 
leave your cast iron in water I'm not
going<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.510> leave<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.840> I'm<00:03:57.050> just<00:03:57.520> putting<00:03:58.520> it<00:03:58.640> in

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
going to leave it I'm just putting it in

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.790 
going to leave it I'm just putting it in
to<00:03:59.000> give<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.330> rinse<00:04:02.050> so<00:04:03.050> we<00:04:03.140> can<00:04:03.350> see<00:04:03.590> where

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
to give it a rinse so we can see where

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.060 
to give it a rinse so we can see where
we're<00:04:03.950> at<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.950> base<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.520> still<00:04:08.680> pretty<00:04:09.680> deeply

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
we're at the base is still pretty deeply

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.490 
we're at the base is still pretty deeply
coated<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.820> then<00:04:10.880> all<00:04:11.630> these<00:04:11.780> sides<00:04:12.110> on<00:04:12.320> this

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
coated and then all these sides on this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.240 
coated and then all these sides on this
spot<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.760> rust<00:04:14.030> has<00:04:14.270> simply<00:04:14.840> just<00:04:15.170> eaten<00:04:16.130> away

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
spot the rust has simply just eaten away

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.409 
spot the rust has simply just eaten away
the<00:04:16.400> first<00:04:16.850> layer<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.660> cast<00:04:18.470> iron<00:04:19.270> on<00:04:20.270> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
the first layer of the cast iron on the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.620 
the first layer of the cast iron on the
outside<00:04:21.669> basically<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.820> same<00:04:23.000> thing<00:04:23.330> some

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
outside basically the same thing some

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.700 
outside basically the same thing some
pretty<00:04:23.870> big<00:04:24.169> chunks<00:04:24.590> along<00:04:24.860> here<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:27.590> we're

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
pretty big chunks along here but we're

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.970 
pretty big chunks along here but we're
going<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:27.980> move<00:04:28.880> over<00:04:29.120> into<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.810> next<00:04:30.560> step<00:04:30.800> of

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
going to move over into the next step of

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.920 
going to move over into the next step of
my<00:04:31.160> cleaning<00:04:31.700> which<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.520> basically<00:04:34.930> spray

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
my cleaning which is to basically spray

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.430 
my cleaning which is to basically spray
it<00:04:36.080> down<00:04:36.290> with<00:04:36.790> oven<00:04:37.790> cleaner
