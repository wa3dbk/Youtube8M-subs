00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.580
 hi thank you for your interest in this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.170
 video tutorial since microsoft left 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 to offer your product small windows 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.009
 business server the central server is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 the only alternative available for 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.520
 replace both natively 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 microsoft electrical activity like 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.220
 microsoft change in the small and medium 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 company 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.000
 this tutorial is part of a series 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.070
 of videos where the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.480
 central server capabilities like 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.970
 native replacement of these solutions 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.379
 microsoft we will show different cases 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.540
 of use with real examples in 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.519
 working for it let's do 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.450
 use of various virtual machines to 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.550
 develop the scenarios 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.260
 in our second scenario we will show 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.610
 how to join our central server to a 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.130
 deployment with a windows domain 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.750
 preexisting this case is especially 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.300
 interesting since it allows us to maintain 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.980
 our previous infrastructure and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.750
 start a smooth migration of services 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.090
 that is totally transparent for the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.890
 end user we will check the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140
 replication directory tree the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.930
 ns records is a system of 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 kerberos and group policies 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.650
 replication in both directions and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.450
 practically instantaneous keeping the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.550
 coherence of information in our 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.710
 domain servers in our 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.330
 previous tutorial we have seen that we 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.700
 can offer entity as controller 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.530
 of domain standalone however it is very 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.790
 frequent finding an infrastructure 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.980
 established around a domain 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.140
 pre-existing windows 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.520
 in these cases the administrator wish to 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.940
 enter central as a controller 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.140
 additional to replicate the information 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.540
 go migrating some services 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.370
 progressively all this without any 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.680
 service stop and no need to 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.720
 reconfigure install additional software 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.330
 or rejoin the domain to the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.670
 clients this is exactly what we 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.350
 offers the central server we are going to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.630
 from a scenario with a domain already 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.860
 configured in windows we have in this 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.140
 case a windows server 2008 r2 with the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.300
 central domain 2000 land 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.740
 this windows server was located in the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.170
 same local network as our server 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 essential in fact in this central case 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.380
 is acting as a gateway as a door 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.270
 link for this server windows 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.340
 As indicated in the official documentation 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.470
 of central office available in two points 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.210
 to the point or heretic there is a series of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.830
 points that we must ensure before 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.830
 join this domain of windows 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.020
 most of these points are pretty 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.050
 Obvious the servers must have the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.340
 same time and time zone the name of the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.989
 Local domain has to be the same etc 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.660
 with our scenario has prepared 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.030
 we go back to central interface and from 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.620
 the configuration domain form 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.660
 we can verify that you only have to 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.090
 fill in a pretty data set 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.590
 accessible to the administrator the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.900
 server function in this case 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.370
 control of additional domain 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.870
 the effect of n of the controller of the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.150
 domain 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.890
 the ip of the main server of the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.510
 domain in this case is the same machine 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.170
 is in local network with central as 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.819
 we said 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.210
 and the account to the administrator and his 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.030
 password 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.370
 fill in this form 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.090
 ward we would make the changes and now we only 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.260
 it would be 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.260
 activate the module 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 of file and domain sharing 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.819
 at the end of this operation we can already 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.290
 see on the domain controllers here 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.750
 appears essential as one of the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.510
 decent domain controllers to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.450
 Sunday lnd 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.930
 We are going to create 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.680
 an example user here in our 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.680
 windows server 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.580
 we create a user and we are going to create 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.570
 as well 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.570
 an example group 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.220
 once the group is created 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.690
 let's add 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.690
 to this user the group 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.120
 in agreement 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.540
 we apply the changes in the domain of 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.540
 windows 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.310
 here in users and teams manage 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.510
 we see what 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.510
 our user 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.150
 to check that the synchronization is 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:49.319
 effectively bidirectional let's 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.319
 add another user 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.440
 and after a short period they can be 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.440
 half a minute or two minutes 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.400
 let's go to our windows server 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.319
 we refresh the list and see that 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.000
 effectively here the user appears 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.349
 that we have created from the license the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.039
 users that we created in winners are 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:31.139
 have synchronized lit and vice versa what 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.160
 same will happen with the system 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.400
 from ms 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.740
 and here 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.930
 for example we consulted central point 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.449
 central mail point a record that 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.759
 originally did not exist in this this 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.320
 server windows we see that you can 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.630
 solve 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.200
 if we add new records in our 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:57.160
 We can solve them in science in 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.780
 windows and vice versa and we're going to 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.190
 check the operation of the system 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.050
 kerberos throughout the entire domain 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.139
 in this case we have the client here 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.759
 windows already joined the domain 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.270
 has started the session with one of the 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.270
 users 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.310
 and this user if we play here playing 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.380
 list we see that the tickets in this case 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.830
 are offered by win says center point 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.990
 domain point land 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.880
 from science we can have a brooch 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.460
 ttp that I used as we see this check 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.169
 there is kerberos 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.029
 and arranging access 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.889
 instead of allowing everything we are going to 

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:45.129
 restrict that they can only 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:47.199
 Our users enter our proxy 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.460
 valid users in the domain to 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.460
 allow everything for this case 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.130
 we keep changes 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.100
 in a system where we are not using 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.570
 lose you we would have to 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.040
 and enter the credentials of 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.550
 user as soon as we start the 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.550
 navigation 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:07.930
 in this case 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.050
 our windows 7 we have here a 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.720
 browser is already configured 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.180
 to use this proxy we are going to navigate to 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.870
 any page 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:23.199
 as we see, he has asked for credentials and 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.130
 however, if we ask again 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.130
 ticket list 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.890
 we see that effectively 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.540
 the main tickets the axis and the 

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.330
 tics is to say if they were offered by 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.670
 windows originally but we see here 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.200
 central point central point domino dot 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.870
 land which means that these 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.310
 same tickets have allowed him to obtain 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.590
 other tickets for the other services 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:55.260
 so that we can 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.090
 have different services in all 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.550
 domain controllers and the same 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:02.060
 ticket system authorize the 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.060
 users
