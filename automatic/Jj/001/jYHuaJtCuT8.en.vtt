00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.260
 good morning today in the kitchen then 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.469
 we are going to skip the products that we have 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.469
 developed 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.400
 but with a typical flavor we have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.759
 characteristic that we can find in 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.220
 any entity this is a bacon is a 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.500
 bacon completely finished 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.100
 ready to warm a few seconds 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.100
 seconds 10 minutes because it is very thin 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.809
 let's elaborate the cover 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.400
 and that for them all the ingredients 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.400
 then we start by heating a pan 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 made of olives 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.300
 not much 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.559
 this hot 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.559
 the pan first let's prepare 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.590
 Let's see what 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.420
 how 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.420
 this is the table 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.170
 also say that these products are 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.220
 they can talk in many ways we 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.400
 like a lid because we mix by that 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.320
 say meat with carlos were not 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.270
 meat with meat or what we try is 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.350
 that the flavors that the voice has and that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.440
 he takes it from that blood sausage administered with 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.690
 the foot with another different sensation that 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.909
 you can try to elaborate it to our 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.119
 house is very simple and you will see that it is very 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.119
 nice 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.300
 and water is a simple product and for 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.830
 same then now sandwich 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.480
 many many things what are future 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.510
 home 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.500
 well we have the oil is hot 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500
 we gave him the mouthpiece 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:43.720
 let's just leave let's just leave 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.720
 let him go 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.340
 we also make the flavors increase 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.540
 today we highlight loves 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.540
 of the motilla 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.470
 we leave it another second and go 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.280
 preparing that there is compared to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.280
 heat them too 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.220
 because so the oil 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.420
 in the mixtures 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.360
 we are going to much easier to pay the state 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.360
 we simply set aside 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.140
 with the peace process 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.250
 to the heater 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.380
 I'm going to tell you it 's a bit over with 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.380
 a few seconds to warm up 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.069
 as well 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.209
 because the arms 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.470
 let's see 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.830
 it is lasting, it is undertaken and it is already in 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.830
 game 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.580
 sometimes 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.190
 of the table 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.350
 We are going to behave like six tapas 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.430
 I said 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.430
 this process 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:14.190
 and we put a black pudding 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.409
 a piece of blood sausage 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.080
 from bacon 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.949
 we take it to a toothpick 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.949
 as if not 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.830
 and we follow the process 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.730
 well let's cut 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.880
 It is simply 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.420
 we cut the blood sausage 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.420
 and me 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.300
 we could one hour more until that happened 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.300
 I'm going to do three simply 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.250
 much 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.830
 i 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.430
 and well we have a dish the toothpick 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.180
 and we have a very socio-labor dish 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.700
 we see that it has a very nice color and 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.540
 surely you like thank you very much and 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.540
 until the next day
