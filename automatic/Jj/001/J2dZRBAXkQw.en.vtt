00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
this ability to create a world from

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
this ability to create a world from
scratch<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> grid<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.280> created

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
scratch and because the grid was created

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
scratch and because the grid was created
by<00:00:47.790> Kevin<00:00:47.850> Flynn<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.870> world<00:00:49.080> had<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> feel<00:00:49.620> as

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
by Kevin Flynn the world had to feel as

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.530 
by Kevin Flynn the world had to feel as
if<00:00:50.070> every<00:00:50.370> detail<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.970> done<00:00:51.210> by<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.480> person

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
if every detail was done by one person

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.560 
if every detail was done by one person
we<00:00:52.170> wanted<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.650> very<00:00:52.890> real<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.280> tactile<00:00:54.270> world

Tron world is you know incredibly dark
there's<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> grander<00:01:06.000> sense<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.619> geography

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's the grander sense of geography

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
there's the grander sense of geography
there's<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.729> lightning<00:01:09.119> storms<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.720> the

the principles of physics of our world

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
the principles of physics of our world
so<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.869> behaved<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> actual

incredibly flashy and cool it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.510 
incredibly flashy and cool it's
dangerous<00:01:23.720> we<00:01:24.720> made<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.229> disc<00:01:25.440> game<00:01:25.680> multi

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
dangerous we made the disc game multi

dimension

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.969 
dimension
and<00:01:27.799> gave<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.369> much<00:01:28.490> more<00:01:28.729> velocity<00:01:29.119> and

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
and gave it much more velocity and

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.679 
and gave it much more velocity and
created<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.280> more<00:01:31.640> complex<00:01:32.090> gaming

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
created just a more complex gaming

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:45.880 
created just a more complex gaming
experience<00:01:33.409> really<00:01:33.799> supposed<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.310> do
