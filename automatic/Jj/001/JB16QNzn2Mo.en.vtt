over the ball Malay goes to target I'm
in<00:00:49.329> quite<00:00:49.539> a<00:00:49.570> good<00:00:49.719> strong<00:00:49.929> position<00:00:50.109> so<00:00:50.500> if

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
in quite a good strong position so if

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.430

that's all lined with the posts
hopefully<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.769> ball<00:00:53.920> go<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.839> if<00:00:55.839> my

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
hopefully that to the ball go and if my

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
left say it's not in I'll do that one

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.020 
left say it's not in I'll do that one
that's<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.420> big<00:00:58.600> arc<00:00:59.199> or<00:00:59.879> possibility<00:01:00.879> with<00:01:00.969> a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
that's a big arc or possibility with a

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.989 
that's a big arc or possibility with a
ball<00:01:01.179> might<00:01:01.329> go<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:03.129> make<00:01:03.249> it<00:01:03.370> more<00:01:03.489> efficient

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
ball might go can make it more efficient

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.030 
ball might go can make it more efficient
and<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.180> make<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.570> stronger<00:01:05.140> we<00:01:05.590> have<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.860> get<00:01:06.010> a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
and to make it stronger we have to get a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.040 
and to make it stronger we have to get a
body<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.580> target<00:01:07.000> so<00:01:07.570> as<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.720> come<00:01:07.870> in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
body to the target so as you come in

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.960 
body to the target so as you come in
sure<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.770> don't<00:01:08.860> like<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.220> target<00:01:09.580> and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
sure that I don't like the target and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.520 
sure that I don't like the target and
that<00:01:10.000> stock<00:01:10.480> does<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:10.960> we<00:01:11.080> look<00:01:11.260> at<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
that stock does it so we look at the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.330 
that stock does it so we look at the
finish<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.850> far<00:01:13.180> past<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.630> ball<00:01:14.310> towards<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
finish as far past the ball towards the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.430 
finish as far past the ball towards the
goal<00:01:15.400> as<00:01:15.640> possible<00:01:16.090> that's<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.870> big<00:01:17.050> big<00:01:17.260> work

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
goal as possible that's a big big work

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.130

the<00:01:40.480> ball<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:41.260> used<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.860> use<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.370> point

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
the ball so I used to use that to point

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.760 
the ball so I used to use that to point
right<00:01:43.270> through<00:01:43.480> the<00:01:43.570> middle<00:01:43.660> of<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.900> post<00:01:44.110> and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
right through the middle of the post and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.100 
right through the middle of the post and
the<00:01:45.340> reason<00:01:45.670> being<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.660> ball<00:01:46.840> will<00:01:46.960> spin

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
the reason being that the ball will spin

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.900 
the reason being that the ball will spin
on<00:01:47.350> its<00:01:47.470> heaviest<00:01:47.740> access<00:01:48.190> or<00:01:48.340> hivites<00:01:48.670> point

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
on its heaviest access or hivites point

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.360 
on its heaviest access or hivites point
so<00:01:49.840> if<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.050> valve<00:01:50.260> was<00:01:50.440> off<00:01:50.620> this<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.980> different

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
so if the valve was off this a different

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.190 
so if the valve was off this a different
chance<00:01:51.730> it<00:01:51.940> might<00:01:52.060> for<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.780> way<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> ball

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
chance it might for the way of the ball

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.490 
chance it might for the way of the ball
small<00:01:53.830> detail<00:01:54.250> but<00:01:54.690> means<00:01:55.690> these<00:01:56.140> wee<00:01:56.320> things

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
small detail but means these wee things

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.130 
small detail but means these wee things
can<00:01:56.710> be<00:01:56.860> important<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.430> if<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.870> don't<00:01:59.020> have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
can be important so if you don't have

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.210 
can be important so if you don't have
that<00:01:59.230> if<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> valves<00:01:59.770> in<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.920> middle<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.160> the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
that if the valves in the middle of the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.950 
that if the valves in the middle of the
ball<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.060> panel<00:02:01.360> don't<00:02:01.510> want<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.690> vote<00:02:01.780> to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
ball and the panel don't want to vote to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740 
ball and the panel don't want to vote to
pick<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.830> seam<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.280> then<00:02:03.790> line<00:02:04.120> at<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> seam<00:02:04.660> up

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
pick a seam and then line at the seam up

strategically see hips width so if my

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.670 
strategically see hips width so if my
foots<00:05:03.880> underneath<00:05:04.330> they<00:05:04.450> say<00:05:04.570> they're<00:05:05.350> the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
foots underneath they say they're the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.590 
foots underneath they say they're the
line<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.550> my<00:05:06.610> hip<00:05:06.790> then<00:05:07.000> I'm<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.150> quite<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> strong

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
line of my hip then I'm a quite a strong

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.210 
line of my hip then I'm a quite a strong
position<00:05:07.780> if<00:05:08.440> it's<00:05:08.590> out<00:05:08.740> here

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
position if it's out here

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.830 
position if it's out here
you<00:05:09.700> probably<00:05:09.820> bit<00:05:10.030> too<00:05:10.150> far<00:05:10.330> away<00:05:10.450> if<00:05:10.690> I'm

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
you probably bit too far away if I'm

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.240 
you probably bit too far away if I'm
inside<00:05:11.110> my<00:05:11.260> hip<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.590> probably<00:05:11.860> too<00:05:12.010> close

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
inside my hip and probably too close

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.280 
inside my hip and probably too close
it's<00:05:12.850> almost<00:05:12.910> like<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.870> word<00:05:14.020> for<00:05:14.170> your

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
it's almost like a the word for your

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.320 
it's almost like a the word for your
hips<00:05:14.470> away<00:05:15.160> if<00:05:15.430> you<00:05:15.520> know<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.640> mean<00:05:15.730> so<00:05:16.030> focused

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
hips away if you know I mean so focused

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.830 
hips away if you know I mean so focused
on<00:05:16.450> like<00:05:16.660> that<00:05:17.100> that's<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.250> mine<00:05:18.510> no<00:05:19.510> they<00:05:19.750> are

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
on like that that's a mine no they are

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.400 
on like that that's a mine no they are
the<00:05:19.870> understand

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
the understand

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.900 
the understand
so<00:05:21.390> hips<00:05:22.390> width<00:05:22.630> are<00:05:23.140> we<00:05:23.350> in<00:05:23.710> terms<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.790> being

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
so hips width are we in terms of being

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.970 
so hips width are we in terms of being
in<00:05:25.090> front<00:05:25.150> or<00:05:25.720> behind<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:26.050> ball<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.740> want<00:05:26.860> to

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
in front or behind the ball you want to

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.340 
in front or behind the ball you want to
be<00:05:27.070> pretty<00:05:27.370> much<00:05:27.520> then<00:05:28.480> say<00:05:28.750> deer<00:05:28.930> fruit<00:05:29.170> and

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
be pretty much then say deer fruit and

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.380 
be pretty much then say deer fruit and
lane<00:05:29.500> with<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:30.550> valve<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.000> ball<00:05:31.180> if

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
lane with a the valve of the ball if

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.620 
lane with a the valve of the ball if
it's<00:05:31.690> too<00:05:31.870> far<00:05:32.080> forward<00:05:32.380> you've<00:05:33.340> got<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.640> swing

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
it's too far forward you've got it swing

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.730 
it's too far forward you've got it swing
bar<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:35.020> you're<00:05:35.140> not<00:05:35.290> going<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.470> find<00:05:35.590> that

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
strong position if it's to just was this

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.620 
strong position if it's to just was this
is<00:05:39.340> too<00:05:39.460> far<00:05:39.640> backwards<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.210> was<00:05:40.330> too<00:05:40.450> far

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.620 
is too far backwards that was too far
forward<00:05:40.930> you're<00:05:41.410> going<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.680> be<00:05:41.740> leaning<00:05:41.920> back

forward you're going to be leaning back

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.480 
forward you're going to be leaning back
it's<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.690> comfort<00:05:43.990> thing<00:05:44.020> but<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.500> generally
