00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
change in the food system is to take a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.730 
change in the food system is to take a
holistic<00:01:25.820> approach<00:01:26.230> because<00:01:27.230> there's<00:01:27.440> so

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
holistic approach because there's so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.850 
holistic approach because there's so
many<00:01:27.950> single<00:01:28.490> slice<00:01:28.670> groups<00:01:29.060> out<00:01:29.300> there<00:01:29.330> like

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
many single slice groups out there like

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.800 
many single slice groups out there like
hsus<00:01:30.860> or<00:01:31.100> pita<00:01:31.370> that<00:01:32.060> want<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.330> see<00:01:32.510> one<00:01:32.780> thing

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
hsus or pita that want to see one thing

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.520 
hsus or pita that want to see one thing
change<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.970> they<00:01:34.970> are<00:01:35.240> not<00:01:35.450> really<00:01:35.900> focusing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
change and they are not really focusing

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.800 
change and they are not really focusing
on<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.190> holistic<00:01:37.490> approach<00:01:38.000> or<00:01:38.180> system-wide

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
on the holistic approach or system-wide

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.610 
on the holistic approach or system-wide
impact<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.250> what<00:01:40.610> we're<00:01:40.790> going<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.180> do<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.720> look

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
impact so what we're going to do is look

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.690 
impact so what we're going to do is look
at<00:01:44.050> egg<00:01:45.050> production<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.920> three<00:01:46.460> different

types<00:01:47.480> of<00:01:47.780> systems<00:01:48.260> one<00:01:48.800> would<00:01:49.100> be<00:01:49.280> the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
it's 72 square inches so that's the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
say and then we'll look at an aviary so

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.039

that's<00:02:28.340> where<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.610> birds<00:02:28.819> have<00:02:29.120> free<00:02:29.540> free

that's where the birds have free free

range<00:02:30.319> within<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.950> building<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.549> it's<00:02:31.700> in

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
range within a building so it's in

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.440 
range within a building so it's in
inside<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.049> then<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.099> a<00:02:34.190> rich<00:02:34.370> cage<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.329> an

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
inside and then in a rich cage so an

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.180 
inside and then in a rich cage so an
enriched<00:02:35.750> cage<00:02:35.989> what<00:02:36.319> happens<00:02:36.650> there<00:02:36.920> is

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
enriched cage what happens there is

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.479 
enriched cage what happens there is
using<00:02:37.730> European<00:02:38.269> guidelines<00:02:38.690> instead<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.680> 67

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489

square<00:02:40.730> inches<00:02:41.000> birds<00:02:41.299> have<00:02:41.920> 116<00:02:42.920> square

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
square inches birds have 116 square

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.819 
square inches birds have 116 square
inches<00:02:43.670> per<00:02:43.940> bird<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:44.989> they<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.290> purchase

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
inches per bird but they have purchase

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.369 
inches per bird but they have purchase
they<00:02:46.489> have<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.670> nest<00:02:46.940> box<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.690> scratch<00:02:47.989> area

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
they have a nest box and a scratch area

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.250 
they have a nest box and a scratch area
so<00:02:49.099> those<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.370> behaviors<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.359> a<00:02:50.420> bird<00:02:50.720> wants

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
so those are behaviors that a bird wants

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.140 
so those are behaviors that a bird wants
to<00:02:51.379> perform<00:02:51.560> now<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.549> can<00:02:52.670> argue<00:02:52.819> whether

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
to perform now one can argue whether

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.180 
to perform now one can argue whether
they<00:02:53.420> need<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.049> do<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.379> or<00:02:54.500> not<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:54.680> birds

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
they need to do that or not but birds

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.300 
they need to do that or not but birds
want<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.700> perform<00:02:56.090> those<00:02:56.720> behaviors<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.010> for

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
want to perform those behaviors so for

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.160 
want to perform those behaviors so for
every<00:02:58.549> bird<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.970> need<00:02:59.150> six<00:02:59.420> inches<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.930> perch

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
every bird you need six inches of perch

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.130 
every bird you need six inches of perch
and<00:03:00.440> all<00:03:01.160> birds<00:03:01.459> want<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.909> perch<00:03:02.239> especially

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
and all birds want to perch especially

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.220 
and all birds want to perch especially
at<00:03:03.230> night<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.730> somewhat<00:03:05.390> stressful<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
at night and it is somewhat stressful to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.020 
at night and it is somewhat stressful to
a<00:03:06.260> bird<00:03:06.560> if<00:03:06.829> they<00:03:07.099> can't<00:03:07.370> perform<00:03:07.609> those

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
a bird if they can't perform those

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.680 
a bird if they can't perform those
behaviors<00:03:08.569> now<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:10.250> big<00:03:10.489> question<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:11.150> well

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
behaviors now the big question is well

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.250 
behaviors now the big question is well
how<00:03:11.720> stressful<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.849> we<00:03:14.000> know

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
how stressful is it because we know

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.899 
how stressful is it because we know

know<00:04:10.040> there's<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.280> report<00:04:10.730> just<00:04:10.970> out<00:04:11.209> a

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
know there's a report just out a

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.839 
know there's a report just out a
European<00:04:11.900> study<00:04:12.169> just<00:04:12.379> out<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.859> that<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:13.669> you

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
European study just out that that if you

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.789 
European study just out that that if you
take<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.090> snapshot<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:14.989> look<00:04:15.199> you'll<00:04:15.709> see

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
take a snapshot and you look you'll see

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.520 
take a snapshot and you look you'll see
more<00:04:16.130> broken<00:04:16.519> bones<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:17.000> birds<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:18.169> are<00:04:18.229> in
