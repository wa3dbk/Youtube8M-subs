00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
us but the actual barrier which is

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.499 
us but the actual barrier which is
actually<00:01:40.829> still<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.970> easy<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.329> walking

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
actually still just as easy as walking

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840 
actually still just as easy as walking
in<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> corner<00:01:43.200> practically<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.490> once<00:01:44.700> you're

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
in a corner practically so once you're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
in a corner practically so once you're
in<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.000> area<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> ran<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:47.280> going

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in this area that I ran to you're going

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
in this area that I ran to you're going
to<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.479> sure<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:49.049> have

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to want to just make sure you don't have

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
to want to just make sure you don't have
any<00:01:49.439> zombies<00:01:49.950> or<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.159> least<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.610> zombie

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
any zombies or at least is one zombie

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.380 
any zombies or at least is one zombie
and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.759> between<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and then you want to get up between that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.709 
and then you want to get up between that
piece<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> asphalt<00:01:55.340> right<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.329> car

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
piece of asphalt right here and the car

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.580 
piece of asphalt right here and the car
after<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.500> kill<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> zombie<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> get

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
after I kill a zombie so you want to get

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.530 
after I kill a zombie so you want to get
up<00:02:01.710> onto<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.310> piece<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.579> asphalt<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
up onto that piece of asphalt and the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
up onto that piece of asphalt and the
car<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.899> wet<00:02:04.140> yourself<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> corner<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
car and wet yourself in the corner so I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.940 
car and wet yourself in the corner so I
do<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.840> wrong<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.229> first<00:02:07.259> time<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
do it wrong the first time but then I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.160 
do it wrong the first time but then I
fix<00:02:08.250> myself<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> wet<00:02:09.959> yourself

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
fix myself so you kind of wet yourself

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.780 
fix myself so you kind of wet yourself
in<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> corner<00:02:10.860> you'll<00:02:11.009> feel<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> little<00:02:11.459> niche

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
in the corner you'll feel a little niche

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.140 
in the corner you'll feel a little niche
where<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> corner

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
where you're right in the corner

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.960 
where you're right in the corner
and<00:02:13.299> then<00:02:13.569> slowly<00:02:13.810> slide<00:02:14.349> down<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.340> then

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and then slowly slide down and then

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.429 
and then slowly slide down and then
you'll<00:02:16.120> drop<00:02:16.390> down<00:02:16.720> you'll<00:02:16.930> drop<00:02:17.110> straight

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
you'll drop down you'll drop straight

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.369 
you'll drop down you'll drop straight
down<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.480> then<00:02:19.480> once<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.930> drop<00:02:20.140> straight

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
down and then once you drop straight

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.910 
down and then once you drop straight
down<00:02:20.500> here<00:02:20.860> no<00:02:21.010> you're<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.549> glitch<00:02:21.760> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
down here no you're in the glitch so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.130 
down here no you're in the glitch so
it's<00:02:23.920> real<00:02:24.220> simple<00:02:24.489> guys<00:02:25.180> honestly<00:02:25.569> it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
it's real simple guys honestly it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's real simple guys honestly it's
probably<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.950> easiest<00:02:27.370> barrier<00:02:28.000> glitch<00:02:28.269> to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
probably the easiest barrier glitch to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.589 
probably the easiest barrier glitch to
perform<00:02:29.439> and<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.970> quick<00:02:31.209> thing<00:02:31.239> about

perform and one quick thing about

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.619 
perform and one quick thing about
glitches<00:02:32.109> in<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.760> i'm<00:02:33.760> only<00:02:34.000> posting<00:02:34.239> this

in this video so I don't really support

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.649 
in this video so I don't really support

really cool spot you can get all these

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.430 
really cool spot you can get all these
zombies<00:03:19.120> just<00:03:19.389> stack<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.079> just<00:03:20.230> watch

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
zombies just stack up here just watch

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.530 
zombies just stack up here just watch
out<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:21.250> there's<00:03:21.489> one<00:03:21.730> real<00:03:22.120> weird

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
out because there's one real weird

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.960 
out because there's one real weird
glitch<00:03:22.930> where<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.500> zombie<00:03:24.220> will<00:03:24.400> just<00:03:24.609> die

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
glitch where a zombie will just die

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.909 
glitch where a zombie will just die
randomly<00:03:25.750> even<00:03:26.260> if<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.410> don't<00:03:26.560> shoot<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.829> and

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
randomly even if you don't shoot it and

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.890 
randomly even if you don't shoot it and
then<00:03:27.519> all<00:03:27.699> the<00:03:27.730> zombies<00:03:28.000> will<00:03:28.209> swarm<00:03:28.599> it<00:03:28.810> it

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
then all the zombies will swarm it it

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.089 
then all the zombies will swarm it it
breaks<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.379> barrier<00:03:29.650> glitch<00:03:30.010> somehow<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.699> so

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
breaks the barrier glitch somehow and so
