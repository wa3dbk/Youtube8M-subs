00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.089
 change one for natural first of all 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.820
 soak the skin in water for the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.010
 soften when retemper about 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 ten minutes 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.920
 we can roll it around the circle 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 with a spoon 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.779
 can easily made with a piece 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 of aluminum brass when the skin is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.170
 totally softened so it will be easy 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.029
 to rise 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.899
 we can adjust it on the circle 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:39.420
 drop the skin under the circle and then 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.340
 believe rolling the skin around the circle on 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.670
 keeps the skin fixed using 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 tongs is and we flip the skin around 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.989
 the circle with the teaspoon is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 made sure to get four points 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.250
 fixed and then we will re-read each of the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 points between them 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.640
 he 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.000
 and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.619
 now that the four points are 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.530
 obtained I reread these points between them in 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.500
 sewing using the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.119
 spoon I roll the skin behind the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.680
 circle so that it is well 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.680
 imprisoned is maintained 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.580
 so that the skin is secure there 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.319
 I adjust one last time all but 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.319
 sewing on the frame 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.330
 the skin is finished but she is 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.980
 still wet 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.710
 she will have to dry an hour or 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.690
 two quietly to lose any 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.700
 the water it contains and soft 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.700
 naturally on the wooden circle 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.980
 this is your skin ready to mount
