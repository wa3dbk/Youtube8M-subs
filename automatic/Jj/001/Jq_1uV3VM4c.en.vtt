was a kid so I know how it works
ours<00:02:23.519> were<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.879> rusty<00:02:24.780> metal<00:02:24.959> though<00:02:25.319> you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
ours were like rusty metal though you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.190 
ours were like rusty metal though you
know<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.370> goes<00:02:26.580> yeah<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.420> pretty<00:02:27.989> much<00:02:28.080> all

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
know that goes yeah so pretty much all

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.740 
know that goes yeah so pretty much all
plastic<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.830> his<00:02:29.099> eyes<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.819> back<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.510> forth

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
plastic and his eyes go back and forth

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:41.479 
plastic and his eyes go back and forth
faster<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.870> go<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.140> more<00:02:39.709> adorable<00:02:40.709> he's

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
faster you go the more adorable he's

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.270 
faster you go the more adorable he's
smiling<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.680> before<00:02:44.040> wheels

yeah

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.569 
yeah
so<00:02:46.950> yeah<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> guess<00:02:47.549> we'll<00:02:47.790> uh<00:02:48.620> also<00:02:49.620> what<00:02:50.220> there

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
so yeah I guess we'll uh also what there

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.300 
so yeah I guess we'll uh also what there
is<00:02:50.700> no<00:02:50.880> break<00:02:51.090> oh<00:02:51.420> well<00:02:52.290> yeah<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.950> way<00:02:53.069> your

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
is no break oh well yeah the way your

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430 
is no break oh well yeah the way your
child<00:02:53.519> stops<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.120> by<00:02:54.269> putting<00:02:54.480> their<00:02:54.720> feet<00:02:54.959> on

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
child stops is by putting their feet on

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.650 
child stops is by putting their feet on
the<00:02:55.500> ground<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.459> that's<00:02:56.910> probably<00:02:57.269> what<00:02:57.540> they

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the ground so that's probably what they

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.990 
the ground so that's probably what they
would<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.930> anyway<00:02:58.379> they<00:02:59.280> would<00:02:59.489> they<00:02:59.700> wouldn't

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
would do anyway they would they wouldn't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789 
would do anyway they would they wouldn't
get<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.269> concept<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.930> oh<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.200> need<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.620> grab
