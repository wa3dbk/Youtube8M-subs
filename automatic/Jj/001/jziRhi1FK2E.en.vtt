00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 ... In the Formula One races, each part of the second divides 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 Thousands of working hours are dedicated to improving the performance of Arab women 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 But more hours are devoted to ensuring reliability 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.250
 Inside the engine and gearbox is one of the most difficult conditions 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.500
 And provide the appropriate oils to maintain good performance 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 It is the latest innovation in Formula One 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 One of the few areas we can not develop under current regulations 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 A way to increase the Horus Power to the engine, so we try to provide it as much as possible 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.250
 Working with the engineering team of Freeray, Shell is pushing development to the fullest 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.000
 When you develop a fuel and oil, you use good fuel and expect the engine to work 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 The oil is not just a Betaier liquid after operation. It is a basic component of motor camshaft, piston and connecting bar 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.500
 Motor, fuel and oil requirements are developed with some 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.800
 The oil solder is a dielectric layer inside the engine to protect the movement kit, engine camshaft, piston and crankshaft 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.900
 At a time when it maintains the lowest rate of energy leakage within the engine 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.000
 Art in the first access to the highest possible performance rate 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 With complete protection and safety 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.750
 Formula One uses the "Dry Dock" system and the Oil Beetle with two motors in a separate oil-enclosed tub. 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.000
 The system is more efficient than the wet tub system for normal arabes, but it is very annoying to the engineering crew 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 There are many needs to get the engine's essence, the oil is everywhere, and the bitmeal hua 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.250
 You need to drink with less fluid as much as possible 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.500
 Because you want to liquefy with Bismuth fluid and Minafesh pressed 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.800
 Through a carefully added array, Shell oil engineers were able to accelerate the disposal of large Hwa bubbles 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.900
 But they want the oil in every part of the engine as easily as possible 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:18.400
 Always strive to reduce viscosity and oil density, but not lose its ability to protect 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.500
 The oil works as a foam that connects to the engine parts to which it is difficult to reach 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 However, too much foam may disrupt the lubrication process by preventing the formation of the insulating oil layer and thereby disabling it from carrying out its task 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:40.000
 The oil also acts as a motor cleaner, but with the refueling regulations this season, and I am forced to run smaller engines, the cooling properties of Shell Helix oils have a greater concentration 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 How much energy does the oil flow into the oil as a pure, solid refrigerant? We need to deal with it 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.600
 On the scale of trouble, oil development is one of the most aggressive and dynamic areas of Formula One 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.732
 It is possible to achieve this type of progress day and night 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.500
 The new Formula One is a possible contest in which Netaage is achieved in a few days or months 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.600
 Long-term participation is the basis for the development of real advanced components 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.500
 . However, in the end any progress made is a happy news for the average car driver 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.500
 It translates my response to the technical rules in the other to the needs we appreciate at Shell Helix Ultra on normal off-track routes 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 It was possible to see him in the first in Formula One and a higher card. In cars on the road, you are looking for fuel and longer distances, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions
