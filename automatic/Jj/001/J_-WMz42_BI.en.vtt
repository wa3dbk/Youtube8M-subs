00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
especially cool because if you notice

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.280 
especially cool because if you notice
neither<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.729> them<00:01:25.880> has<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.119> gun<00:01:26.479> now<00:01:27.080> all<00:01:27.259> of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
neither of them has a gun now all of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.310 
neither of them has a gun now all of
this<00:01:27.560> information<00:01:27.710> before<00:01:28.190> what<00:01:28.910> not<00:01:29.180> mean<00:01:29.390> it

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
this information before what not mean it

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.139 
this information before what not mean it
didn't<00:01:30.649> mean<00:01:30.740> anything<00:01:30.800> at<00:01:31.280> all<00:01:31.369> but<00:01:31.970> if<00:01:32.060> you

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
didn't mean anything at all but if you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.790 
didn't mean anything at all but if you
pay<00:01:32.300> attention<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.899> now<00:01:33.140> they<00:01:33.590> have

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
pay attention to it now they have

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.790 
pay attention to it now they have
absolutely<00:01:34.039> no<00:01:34.700> weapon<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.560> one<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.679> them

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
absolutely no weapon and one of them

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.040 
absolutely no weapon and one of them
uses<00:01:37.069> stealth<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.240> believe<00:01:38.780> these<00:01:39.020> are

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
uses stealth so I do believe these are

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.260 
uses stealth so I do believe these are
the<00:01:39.440> stealth<00:01:39.830> classes<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.550> they<00:01:40.700> might<00:01:41.030> not

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
the stealth classes and they might not

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:56.970 
the stealth classes and they might not
get<00:01:41.569> a<00:01:41.600> weapon<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.229> let's<00:01:42.380> continue

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:19.980 

right<00:01:57.940> out

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:29.580 

stealth

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.000 

and<00:02:30.340> no<00:02:31.150> stealth<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.349> leads<00:02:32.650> me<00:02:32.769> to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
and no stealth now this leads me to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.330 
and no stealth now this leads me to
believe<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:34.360> actually<00:02:35.140> might<00:02:35.440> be<00:02:35.920> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
believe that this actually might be a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.729 
believe that this actually might be a
timed<00:02:36.970> thing<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:37.989> if<00:02:38.260> you're<00:02:38.470> using

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
timed thing because if you're using

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.860 
timed thing because if you're using
stealth<00:02:39.190> camouflage<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.060> don't<00:02:40.269> just<00:02:40.599> turn

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
stealth camouflage you don't just turn

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.839 
stealth camouflage you don't just turn
it<00:02:41.050> off<00:02:41.170> third<00:02:41.950> absolutely<00:02:42.519> there'd<00:02:42.700> be

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
it off third absolutely there'd be

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.270 
it off third absolutely there'd be
absolutely<00:02:43.239> no<00:02:43.480> reason<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.379> turn<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.129> off

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
absolutely no reason to just turn it off

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.210 
absolutely no reason to just turn it off
so<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:46.000> believe<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.599> is<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.810> very<00:02:47.110> limited<00:02:47.530> use

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
so I believe this is a very limited use

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.400 
so I believe this is a very limited use
for<00:02:48.640> anything<00:02:49.000> other<00:02:49.330> than<00:02:49.450> team<00:02:49.810> sneak<00:02:50.110> team

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
for anything other than team sneak team

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.410 
for anything other than team sneak team
sneak<00:02:50.680> obviously<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.519> going<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.180> a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
sneak obviously is going to have a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.900 
sneak obviously is going to have a
full-blown<00:02:53.010> stealth<00:02:54.010> where<00:02:54.640> you're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
full-blown stealth where you're

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.850 
full-blown stealth where you're
completely<00:02:55.420> invisible<00:02:55.780> just<00:02:56.140> like<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.500> go2

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
completely invisible just like in go2

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.190

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
the the heavy the first three I think or

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.130 
the the heavy the first three I think or
maybe<00:03:26.950> even<00:03:27.129> four<00:03:27.569> classes<00:03:28.569> he<00:03:28.690> was<00:03:28.840> changing

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
maybe even four classes he was changing

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.680 
maybe even four classes he was changing
to<00:03:29.290> work<00:03:29.440> all<00:03:29.680> heavy<00:03:30.099> classes<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.510> fact

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
to work all heavy classes and in fact

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.629 
to work all heavy classes and in fact
they<00:03:31.870> may<00:03:32.049> all<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.590> been<00:03:32.650> heavy<00:03:33.010> classes<00:03:33.489> for

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
they may all have been heavy classes for

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.830 
they may all have been heavy classes for
all<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.790> know<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.329> they<00:03:34.450> were<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.660> showing

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
all I know and they were just showing

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.970 
all I know and they were just showing
the<00:03:35.079> different<00:03:35.380> things<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.709> could<00:03:35.829> do

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
the different things you could do

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.819 
the different things you could do
changing<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.670> helmet<00:03:37.120> changing<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.230> armor

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
or whatnot but apparently from what they

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.250 
or whatnot but apparently from what they
said<00:03:41.650> each<00:03:41.889> class<00:03:42.310> will<00:03:42.340> be<00:03:43.260> recognizable

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
said each class will be recognizable

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
said each class will be recognizable
from<00:03:44.410> other<00:03:44.620> classes<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.250> won't<00:03:45.489> mistake<00:03:45.760> a

from other classes you won't mistake a

that's<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.480> impression<00:03:49.690> they<00:03:50.290> gave<00:03:50.500> up<00:03:50.680> they

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
that's the impression they gave up they

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.940 
that's the impression they gave up they

helmet<00:04:37.210> was<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.570> MGO<00:04:37.930> too<00:04:38.169> so<00:04:38.469> whatever<00:04:38.620> you

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
helmet was in MGO too so whatever you

color to your gear so you

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.940 
color to your gear so you
