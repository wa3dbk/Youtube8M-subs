long<00:01:20.700> continuous<00:01:20.729> structure<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.960> would

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
long continuous structure as you would

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
long continuous structure as you would
think<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.649> lot<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.009> us<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.490> thought<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
think or a lot of us think I thought I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.819 
think or a lot of us think I thought I
thought<00:01:24.240> too<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.990> series<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> walls<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
thought too it's a series of walls and

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.020 
thought too it's a series of walls and
not<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> them<00:01:26.399> are<00:01:26.520> connected<00:01:26.909> together

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
not all of them are connected together

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
not all of them are connected together
it's<00:01:27.750> built<00:01:27.990> by<00:01:28.140> many<00:01:28.409> different<00:01:28.560> dynasties

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

over<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> centuries<00:01:29.759> basically<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> story

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
over the centuries basically the story

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.620

is that before China was one unified
nation<00:01:33.869> was<00:01:34.860> divided<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.549> warring

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
nation was divided into these warring

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
um and so all of these states had their

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
um and so all of these states had their
kind<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.240> their<00:01:42.390> own<00:01:42.570> walls<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.409> keep<00:01:43.530> each

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
you do any research on the long wall of

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.120 
you do any research on the long wall of
ten<00:03:09.980> thousand<00:03:10.340> Li<00:03:10.959> you're<00:03:11.959> gonna<00:03:12.079> notice<00:03:12.380> that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
ten thousand Li you're gonna notice that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.009 
ten thousand Li you're gonna notice that
there's<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.400> wide<00:03:13.730> range<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.299> reported<00:03:14.720> lengths

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
there's a wide range of reported lengths

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.750 
there's a wide range of reported lengths
for<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.319> thing<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.769> that's<00:03:16.250> because<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.639> all

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
for this thing and that's because of all

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.000 
for this thing and that's because of all
is<00:03:16.850> notoriously<00:03:17.420> hard<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.780> measure<00:03:18.010> there's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
is notoriously hard to measure there's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.559 
is notoriously hard to measure there's
crazy<00:03:19.310> topography<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.359> all<00:03:20.540> around

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
crazy topography going on all around

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.809 
crazy topography going on all around
this<00:03:20.900> thing<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.290> runs<00:03:21.889> over<00:03:22.130> crazy<00:03:22.519> high

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
this thing I runs over crazy high

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.110 
this thing I runs over crazy high
mountain<00:03:23.180> peaks<00:03:23.470> deserts<00:03:24.549> there's<00:03:25.549> also<00:03:25.819> some

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
mountain peaks deserts there's also some

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.220 
mountain peaks deserts there's also some
stretches<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.569> all<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.840> are<00:03:26.930> nearly

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
stretches of all that are nearly

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.949 
stretches of all that are nearly
vertical<00:03:27.620> mm-hmm<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.970> very<00:03:29.329> hard<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.720> measure

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
vertical mm-hmm so very hard to measure

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.250 
vertical mm-hmm so very hard to measure
yeah<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.850> general<00:03:32.450> yeah<00:03:33.049> they're

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
yeah and and in general yeah they're

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.740 
yeah and and in general yeah they're
only<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.650> area<00:03:33.829> I<00:03:34.280> guess<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.569> wall<00:03:35.720> is

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
only the area I guess that the wall is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.289 
only the area I guess that the wall is
sitting<00:03:36.410> on<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.769> not<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.760> wall<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:37.970> course

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
sitting on so not and the wall of course

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.789 
sitting on so not and the wall of course
is<00:03:38.450> vertical<00:03:39.220> almost<00:03:40.220> nearly<00:03:40.489> vertical<00:03:41.799> but

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
is vertical almost nearly vertical but

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.680 
is vertical almost nearly vertical but
so<00:03:43.040> interestingly<00:03:43.609> enough<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.299> order<00:03:44.420> to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
so interestingly enough in order to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.059 
so interestingly enough in order to
solve<00:03:45.139> this

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
solve this

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.099 
solve this
this<00:03:46.370> disputed<00:03:47.030> length<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.659> great<00:03:47.870> wall

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
this disputed length that the great wall

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.959 
this disputed length that the great wall
which<00:03:48.739> is<00:03:48.859> obviously<00:03:49.280> very<00:03:49.370> important

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
which is obviously very important

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:55.119 
which is obviously very important
cultural<00:03:51.700> heritage<00:03:52.700> piece<00:03:52.999> for<00:03:53.629> China<00:03:54.129> they

cultural heritage piece for China they

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.640 
cultural heritage piece for China they
did<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:55.939> a<00:03:55.999> couple<00:03:56.269> of<00:03:56.659> state<00:03:56.930> agencies<00:03:57.469> did

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
did this a couple of state agencies did

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.830 
did this a couple of state agencies did

a surveying and mapping project to
determine<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.409> width<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.769> length<00:04:00.799> of<00:04:01.099> the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:01.219 
determine the width the length of the

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.979 
determine the width the length of the
wall<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:02.629> 2009<00:04:03.349> they<00:04:04.310> found<00:04:04.670> out<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.299> the

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
wall and in 2009 they found out that the

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.199 
wall and in 2009 they found out that the
walls<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.650> overall<00:04:07.189> length<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.609> wall<00:04:07.819> is

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
walls the overall length of the wall is

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.089 
walls the overall length of the wall is
about<00:04:08.540> three<00:04:08.840> thousand<00:04:09.319> nine<00:04:09.469> hundred<00:04:09.500> miles

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
about three thousand nine hundred miles

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.119 
about three thousand nine hundred miles
but<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:10.879> just<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.780> wall<00:04:12.139> itself<00:04:12.709> okay

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
but that is just the wall itself okay

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.580 
but that is just the wall itself okay
because<00:04:13.489> apparently<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:14.090> wall<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.569> also<00:04:15.290> also

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
because apparently the wall is also also

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.789 
because apparently the wall is also also
has<00:04:15.950> non<00:04:16.190> wall<00:04:16.459> sections<00:04:17.000> like<00:04:17.750> barriers<00:04:18.320> but

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
has non wall sections like barriers but

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.740 
has non wall sections like barriers but
that<00:04:18.949> are<00:04:19.099> made<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.519> natural<00:04:19.910> things<00:04:20.449> like

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
that are made out of natural things like

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.219 
that are made out of natural things like
okay<00:04:21.410> like<00:04:21.680> their<00:04:21.949> trenches<00:04:22.720> hillsides<00:04:23.720> no

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
okay like their trenches hillsides no

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.629 
okay like their trenches hillsides no
prob<00:04:24.500> um<00:04:24.789> yeah<00:04:25.789> moats<00:04:26.630> stuff<00:04:27.139> like<00:04:27.289> that

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
prob um yeah moats stuff like that

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.879 
prob um yeah moats stuff like that
interesting<00:04:28.639> okay<00:04:29.300> well<00:04:29.720> now<00:04:30.530> here's<00:04:30.710> another

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
interesting okay well now here's another

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.129 
interesting okay well now here's another
interesting<00:04:31.099> thing<00:04:31.479> they<00:04:32.479> also<00:04:32.660> found<00:04:32.960> some

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
interesting thing they also found some

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.600 
interesting thing they also found some
previously<00:04:33.530> undiscovered<00:04:34.009> sections<00:04:34.490> of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
previously undiscovered sections of

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.680 
previously undiscovered sections of
walls<00:04:34.759> when<00:04:34.970> they<00:04:35.090> were<00:04:35.150> when<00:04:35.539> they<00:04:35.660> were

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
walls when they were when they were

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.260 
walls when they were when they were
doing<00:04:35.900> their<00:04:36.050> measuring<00:04:36.440> about<00:04:36.979> 180<00:04:37.789> miles

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
doing their measuring about 180 miles

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.580 
doing their measuring about 180 miles
worth<00:04:39.880> 180<00:04:40.880> miles<00:04:41.240> worth<00:04:41.599> let's<00:04:42.169> do<00:04:42.289> all

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
worth 180 miles worth let's do all

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.100 
worth 180 miles worth let's do all
that's<00:04:43.099> crazy<00:04:43.460> cool<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.509> apparently<00:04:44.840> they

that's crazy cool and apparently they

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.589 
that's crazy cool and apparently they
had<00:04:45.229> been<00:04:45.349> buried<00:04:45.500> by<00:04:45.770> sand<00:04:45.830> storms<00:04:46.570> over<00:04:47.570> a
