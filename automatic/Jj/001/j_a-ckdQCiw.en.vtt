like that inside lien is starting to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.210 
like that inside lien is starting to
pick<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:55.739> guys<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.130> the

and really moving ahead looks like the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.540 
and really moving ahead looks like the
outside<00:03:01.110> lane<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> fastest<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.520> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
outside lane is the fastest and the
