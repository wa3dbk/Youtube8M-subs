I<00:02:13.150> also<00:02:13.750> gave<00:02:14.080> some<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.830> writing<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
I also gave some of the writing to the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.610 
I also gave some of the writing to the
dancers<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.090> we<00:02:16.569> had<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.900> interpret<00:02:17.440> that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
dancers and we had to interpret that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.220 
dancers and we had to interpret that
through<00:02:18.459> movement<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.840> kept<00:02:20.020> going

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
through movement and we kept going

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.020 
through movement and we kept going
backwards<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.190> forwards<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:21.700> different

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
backwards and forwards with different

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.449 
backwards and forwards with different
ideas<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> concepts<00:02:23.709> for<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.340> one

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
ideas but one of the concepts for to one

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.550 
ideas but one of the concepts for to one
another<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> decisions<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.440> I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
another and one of the decisions that I

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.440 
another and one of the decisions that I
made<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.040> very<00:02:27.190> beginning<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.060> all

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
made at the very beginning is that all

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.120 
made at the very beginning is that all
the<00:02:28.720> inspiration<00:02:29.050> had<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.560> come<00:02:29.739> from<00:02:29.950> within

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
the inspiration had to come from within

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.030 
the inspiration had to come from within
the<00:02:30.400> room<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> wasn't<00:02:31.870> going<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:33.010> be

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the room so I wasn't going to to be

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.509 
the room so I wasn't going to to be
looking<00:02:33.370> at<00:02:33.459> books<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:34.090> DVDs<00:02:34.930> or<00:02:35.519> anywhere

looking at books or DVDs or anywhere

looking at books or DVDs or anywhere

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
inspiration I was going to we were going

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.580 
inspiration I was going to we were going
to<00:02:42.849> generate<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.599> room<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.080> that's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
to generate it in that room and that's

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.920 
to generate it in that room and that's
why<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.769> decided<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.280> bring<00:02:45.489> an<00:02:46.150> element<00:02:46.569> of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
why I decided to bring an element of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.120 
why I decided to bring an element of
writing<00:02:47.440> into<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.900> Rafael<00:02:49.900> came<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.650> me<00:02:50.799> and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
writing into it Rafael came to me and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.640 
writing into it Rafael came to me and
asked<00:02:51.760> me<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.360> involved<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.959> making<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
asked me to be involved in making the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.289 
asked me to be involved in making the
poetry<00:02:54.190> sections<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> work

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
poetry sections of the work

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.150 
poetry sections of the work
collaborating<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> poet<00:02:56.680> called<00:02:56.830> Sam

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
collaborating with the poet called Sam

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.539 
collaborating with the poet called Sam
Webster<00:02:57.670> was<00:02:58.510> really<00:02:58.810> interesting<00:02:59.260> because

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
Webster was really interesting because

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.350 
Webster was really interesting because
Sam<00:03:00.549> Webster<00:03:01.260> watched<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.470> dancers<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.160> then

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
Sam Webster watched the dancers and then

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.620 
Sam Webster watched the dancers and then
created<00:03:04.360> poetry<00:03:05.069> from<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.849> pure<00:03:07.090> movement

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
created poetry from the pure movement

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.979 
created poetry from the pure movement
and<00:03:08.220> then<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.489> poetry<00:03:09.880> was<00:03:10.090> handed<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.510> me<00:03:10.630> to

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
and then that poetry was handed to me to

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.979 
and then that poetry was handed to me to
then<00:03:11.220> incorporate<00:03:12.220> into<00:03:12.430> some<00:03:13.209> transition

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
then incorporate into some transition

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.150 
then incorporate into some transition
pieces<00:03:14.400> within<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.670> work<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.420> give<00:03:16.599> some<00:03:17.560> sort

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
pieces within the work to give some sort

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.670 
pieces within the work to give some sort
of<00:03:18.190> meaning<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> work<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.269> use<00:03:19.450> words<00:03:20.380> in

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
of meaning to the work to use words in

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.870 
of meaning to the work to use words in
the<00:03:20.799> work<00:03:21.010> as<00:03:21.310> part<00:03:22.299> of<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:23.739> part<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
the work as part of the as part of the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.819 
the work as part of the as part of the
overall<00:03:24.910> structure<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:26.140> was<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.380> really<00:03:26.650> nice

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
overall structure it was a really nice

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.770 
overall structure it was a really nice
idea<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.519> all<00:03:27.670> came<00:03:27.880> quite<00:03:28.450> organically

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
idea that it all came quite organically

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.940 
idea that it all came quite organically
from<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.549> from<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.700> dance<00:03:30.910> itself<00:03:31.120> as<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
from the from the dance itself as the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.699 
from the from the dance itself as the
time<00:03:32.950> went<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.569> Rafael<00:03:34.569> and<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.780> were<00:03:35.140> listening

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
time went on Rafael and I were listening

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.160 
time went on Rafael and I were listening
to<00:03:35.739> pieces<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.579> music<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.970> he<00:03:37.180> liked<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
to pieces of music that he liked and I

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.099 
to pieces of music that he liked and I
was<00:03:38.620> offering<00:03:38.890> other<00:03:39.069> suggestions<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.180> there

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
was offering other suggestions and there

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.410 
was offering other suggestions and there
was<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.519> fro<00:03:42.790> between<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.850> selected

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
was a to and fro between the selected

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.080 
was a to and fro between the selected
music<00:03:47.049> found<00:03:47.350> music<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.430> Raphael<00:03:48.819> had

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
music found music that that Raphael had

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.580 
music found music that that Raphael had
chosen<00:03:50.579> over<00:03:51.579> time<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.420> both<00:03:52.750> realized<00:03:53.319> that

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
chosen over time we both realized that

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.650 
chosen over time we both realized that
the<00:03:54.040> work<00:03:54.250> needed<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:56.910> kind<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.030> drawing

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
the work needed a kind of drawing

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.509 
the work needed a kind of drawing
together<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.590> all<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.010> disparate<00:04:00.340> elements

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
together of all the disparate elements

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.160 
together of all the disparate elements
to<00:04:01.060> tie<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.540> work<00:04:01.840> together<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:04.750> bring<00:04:04.989> the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
to tie the work together to bring the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.160 
to tie the work together to bring the
concept<00:04:05.650> home<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.400> way<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.359> Raphael

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
concept home in a way and so Raphael

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.160 
concept home in a way and so Raphael
asked<00:04:08.410> me<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.650> compose<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.850> longer<00:04:10.660> section<00:04:11.049> of

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
asked me to compose a longer section of

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.920 
asked me to compose a longer section of
music<00:04:11.560> not<00:04:11.739> just<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:12.220> transition<00:04:13.150> pieces<00:04:13.420> so

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
music not just the transition pieces so

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.229 
music not just the transition pieces so
at<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.950> halfway<00:04:15.130> point<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.760> work<00:04:15.940> there's

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
at the halfway point of the work there's

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.990 
at the halfway point of the work there's
a<00:04:16.329> 15<00:04:16.930> minute<00:04:17.139> piece<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:18.130> comes<00:04:18.459> in<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.850> it's

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
a 15 minute piece that comes in and it's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.830 
a 15 minute piece that comes in and it's
sort<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.479> build<00:04:20.340> build<00:04:21.340> section<00:04:21.810> quite<00:04:22.810> a

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
sort of a build build section quite a

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.010 
sort of a build build section quite a
climax<00:04:23.530> with

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
climax with

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.589 
climax with
