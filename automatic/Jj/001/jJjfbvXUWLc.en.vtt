00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
one thing we made larger was the battery

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.720 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:40.030> fact<00:04:40.540> iphone<00:04:41.140> 4<00:04:41.440> delivers<00:04:41.950> up<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.190> forty

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.680 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:04:43.060> more<00:04:43.360> talk<00:04:43.570> time<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:45.090> we<00:04:46.090> started

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
percent more talk time and we started

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.980 
percent more talk time and we started
with<00:04:47.220> completely<00:04:48.220> opposing<00:04:48.640> goals<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.330> we

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
with completely opposing goals and we

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.350 
with completely opposing goals and we
wanted<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.320> make<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.680> iphone<00:04:51.190> more<00:04:51.820> capable

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
wanted to make this iphone more capable

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.200 
wanted to make this iphone more capable
we<00:04:52.630> wanted<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:52.960> add<00:04:53.140> more<00:04:53.440> feature<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.220> yet<00:04:55.120> at

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
we wanted to add more feature and yet at

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.790 
we wanted to add more feature and yet at
the<00:04:55.270> same<00:04:55.330> time<00:04:55.540> we<00:04:56.230> wanted<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.530> make<00:04:56.650> it

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
the same time we wanted to make it

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.400 
the same time we wanted to make it
smaller<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.400> even<00:04:57.760> thinner<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:59.200> led<00:04:59.380> to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
smaller and even thinner and that led to

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.180 
smaller and even thinner and that led to
some<00:04:59.740> really<00:05:00.160> surprising<00:05:00.310> innovation<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:03.070> we

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
some really surprising innovation and we

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.980 
some really surprising innovation and we
developed<00:05:03.370> an<00:05:03.730> entirely<00:05:04.270> new<00:05:04.450> grade

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
developed an entirely new grade

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.070 
developed an entirely new grade
stainless<00:05:05.620> steel<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.640> after<00:05:07.000> machining<00:05:07.390> is

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
stainless steel that after machining is

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.220 
stainless steel that after machining is
incredibly<00:05:08.980> strong<00:05:09.370> but<00:05:10.210> also<00:05:10.420> remarkably

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
incredibly strong but also remarkably

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.580 
incredibly strong but also remarkably
precise<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:13.030> steel<00:05:13.330> frame<00:05:13.690> functions<00:05:14.290> is<00:05:14.440> the

precise the steel frame functions is the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.250 
precise the steel frame functions is the
antenna<00:05:14.980> but<00:05:15.430> also<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:16.240> primary<00:05:16.510> structure

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
antenna but also the primary structure

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.600 
antenna but also the primary structure
giving<00:05:17.830> us<00:05:18.010> more<00:05:18.250> internal<00:05:18.790> volume<00:05:20.460> we<00:05:21.460> also

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
giving us more internal volume we also

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.550 
giving us more internal volume we also
developed<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.300> custom<00:05:22.690> glass<00:05:22.870> that's

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
developed a custom glass that's

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.110 
developed a custom glass that's
