00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 good mobilization to an end there 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 there was a protest this Friday 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.620
 on the tahrir square they were going 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.700
 of faults 22 hours so I was not 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.740
 positioned on the main roundabout 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.509
 but rather on a median on the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 side so the live position was 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.690
 relatively go back I 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.460
 used to go to this place 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.439
 so to cover the demonstrations 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.170
 I have so much everything is a team of which I am 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.340
 did not feel particularly at risk 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.470
 I waited ten minutes 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.689
 microphone in hand in front of the camera all that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.160
 begins to draw attention to the starting 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 curious and then quite quickly 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.949
 young people to shake 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.260
 so some took a picture 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.880
 others ask me questions and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 finally I had with my colleague 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 disappointment the fcd calm down and I was able to do 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.270
 my direct when badly but to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 buying the atmosphere has really 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.989
 tense my Egyptian colleague tried to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 clear the way so I can 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.350
 go away pretty fast but very 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.719
 quickly crowd or circle several 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.620
 dozens of men mostly young 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.110
 but not only 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 so the touching started I 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.680
 accepted my colleague who 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 was 2 reassures me and who has who 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.539
 kept my attention so we could 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 to the purists clear of this crowd but 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 she became more and more 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 many with some who wanted 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.710
 men who wanted to wear us 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.909
 relief and in those situations that is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.689
 very confusing is that we know more 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.570
 really believe it 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.100
 who to trust and who to follow 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 moment there are even men who we 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 have said to get into a van for us 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.630
 protect but in fact it's a trap 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.180
 that we managed somehow to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.220
 reach the place to pull 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 fugier the waiters saw us arrive 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 so they helped us get in and have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 all curtained down then there was 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.600
 dozens of men have gone to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.759
 the knocking outside and on the doors 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.579
 the restaurant around the neck of twenty 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.649
 minutes I was able to get by and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.210
 thanks to a taxi who came to us 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.220
 to seek that one can gaiety to seek 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 but even to get into the cab that has 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.610
 been difficult so it's an atmosphere 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.130
 very tense uncontrollable and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.360
 unfortunately it is this frequency 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.890
 on the tahrir square it happened to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.409
 other Western Egyptian journalist 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.649
 before to many women and 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.880
 Egyptians whose case often 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.350
 unnoticed this concern in is saying 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.250
 that sexual harassment in Egypt a 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.619
 major problem 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.149
 over 90% of women say they have 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.760
 been victim then to degrees 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.770
 different there were also several 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.270
 sam initiatives 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.690
 especially through the internet for 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.150
 try to end it really put 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.400
 in light this problem recently had 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.110
 several events and women 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.910
 Egyptian women make it a priority and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.240
 they are waiting for lady today that the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.900
 government take this problem very much at 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.060
 serious 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.950
 a problem that has almost become one 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.950
 can say it a plague in egypt
