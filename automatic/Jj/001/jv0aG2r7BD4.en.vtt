00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.290
 the purpose of this video and to understand how the books of publishers and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.660
 authors participating in the partner program are presented in the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.999
 world bed 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.449
 preview is a powerful tool to evolve 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.479
 it's also a simple way for the user to discover new 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.749
 books and browse and buy them 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 let's start with the home page of the beautiful caliber website 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.339
 For how much longer 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.179
 the french site dance for robert the dot fr works exactly the 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.439
 same way 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.860
 now thematic research 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.240
 let's say I'm interested in pop art 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 I enter the piedmont not part of the field of research 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.970
 in the search results there are many results in relation with 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.150
 the research 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.170
 on the first line under the title of a book and to indicate his level of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690
 consultation 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.970
 there are several levels of consultation 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.540
 there is simply the state of utah 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.290
 or not it's not a vision 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.870
 extracts in french 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.810
 a league 2 of the text 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.150
 forecasts 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 or not perceived in French it is this level which interests us 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.570
 and also it must be said 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 the book is then searchable in its entirety 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.370
 let's go back to the overview level 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.680
 it's this level of consultation that's used for the authors' books and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 publishers participating in the partner program in 2000 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.470
 if I click on stage 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.040
 unnoticed then opens 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.210
 we're currently looking at the book preview not part the percentage of 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.040
 consultation available 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.480
 at &amp; t defined by the unit 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.480
 now if I scroll through the pages of this guy 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.180
 we notice that some are missing 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.480
 it's not a marked accent with the following hand 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.610
 lepage 11 12 are not available in this case 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.960
 I arrived at the end of the Civil War 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.910
 it's more consulted 20% of these 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.410
 so for this text about 20 points 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.990
 it is important to note 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 that I do not know how to copy print or even download this 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.119
 preview 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.709
 we have recreated the encryption experience that we know an email 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.669
 if I wish to say the rest solid 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.619
 I always have the opportunity to buy these titles 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:24.589
 actually when bachand links came up on the left in front of the screen 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.609
 I hope this video has helped you better understand how google 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.879
 old books 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.269
 See you soon!
