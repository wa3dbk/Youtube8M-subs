00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
your mind from the master program we

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.080 
your mind from the master program we
actually<00:03:50.690> got<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.170> idea<00:03:51.620> what<00:03:52.130> we<00:03:52.340> wanted<00:03:53.030> to

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
actually got the idea what we wanted to

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.630 
actually got the idea what we wanted to
do<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.480> our<00:03:53.570> lives<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.010> inspiration<00:03:55.610> came

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
do in our lives so the inspiration came

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.010 
do in our lives so the inspiration came
from<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.150> master<00:03:56.450> program<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.900> the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
from the master program is the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.930 
from the master program is the
experiences<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:57.920> had<00:03:58.070> during<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.490> master

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
experiences you had during the master

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.940 
experiences you had during the master
program<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.450> also<00:03:59.990> after<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.620> massive

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
program and also after the massive

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.160 
program and also after the massive
program<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:02.060> without<00:04:02.600> it<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:02.930> probably

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
program so without it I probably

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.290 
program so without it I probably
wouldn't<00:04:03.590> have<00:04:03.680> been<00:04:03.760> self-employed<00:04:04.760> by<00:04:05.120> now

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
wouldn't have been self-employed by now

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.260 
wouldn't have been self-employed by now
so<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.410> was<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> great<00:04:06.740> inspiration<00:04:07.160> for<00:04:07.730> me

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.360 

you
