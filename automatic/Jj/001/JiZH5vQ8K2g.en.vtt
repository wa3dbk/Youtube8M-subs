00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 and three attackers will continue 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.029
 examples of combined 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.040
 ligaments against three attackers and defense 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.929
 from a weapon attack in the third film 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.599
 we will look at examples of exemption from 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.490
 captures throws and fighting techniques in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.080
 the prone position of the first film we 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 told how to move in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.220
 group fight having figured it out 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.630
 maneuver and explore the whole complex 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.369
 street fighting techniques 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 it will not be difficult for you to model yourself 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.019
 several attack options and examples 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 self defense of course impossible 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.260
 provide all possible options 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 attack defense even in the case of two 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.120
 attackers and the more so three too 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.600
 great hawk unpredictability but 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.950
 not 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 it is in this vein that you should 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.180
 to improve in the development of technology and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 personal fights that is modeling and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.420
 practice the actions of various 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 situations both unarmed and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.690
 armed attack 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.460
 using natural learning 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.170
 weapon otherwise not successful 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 of the admission you are injured 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.970
 work these ligaments on the paws like 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.970
 film shown 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.900
 move on to the combined 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.220
 ligaments against three forwards 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.010
 first look visually where 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.270
 directed and strikes in 1 combination elbow 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.370
 you attack in the chin 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.680
 edge of the palm of the same hand in the throat 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.450
 facing the enemy then you 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.760
 turn around for the third day 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.220
 shin which is performed with distracting 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.810
 strike the bottom of the palm and finish 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.119
 a bunch of finishing blow us edge of the palm 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.970
 side to neck or to head second 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.220
 the opponent immediately wants to note that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.660
 this and other bundles are just good examples 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.450
 combinations of different punches 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.710
 interconnected logically work 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 over them you need to learn 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.220
 combine different punches in different 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.140
 directions and consistency is 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.280
 It means that these bundles in their pure form 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.280
 the battle may not work
