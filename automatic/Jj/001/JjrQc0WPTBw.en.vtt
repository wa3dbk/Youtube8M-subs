00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
animation have a different lineage

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.229 
animation have a different lineage
whereas<00:04:07.650> Japanese<00:04:08.220> animation<00:04:08.579> comes<00:04:08.940> from

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
whereas Japanese animation comes from

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.590 
whereas Japanese animation comes from

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
evolved alongside the rise of the film

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.370 
evolved alongside the rise of the film
industry<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.359> they<00:04:15.690> both<00:04:15.780> come<00:04:16.019> from<00:04:16.049> very

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
industry so they both come from very

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.990 
industry so they both come from very
different<00:04:16.530> places<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.160> different<00:04:17.220> styles<00:04:17.880> of

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000

different places and different styles of
visual<00:04:18.329> storytelling<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.830> possibly<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
visual storytelling but possibly the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.530 
visual storytelling but possibly the
greatest<00:04:20.970> modern<00:04:21.660> vindication<00:04:22.590> of

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
greatest modern vindication of

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
japanese visual storytelling is the work

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.370
