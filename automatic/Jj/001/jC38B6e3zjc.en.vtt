00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
as well as like there's meant to be like

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.270 
as well as like there's meant to be like
a<00:02:36.810> puzzle<00:02:37.050> map<00:02:37.319> type<00:02:37.560> deal<00:02:37.739> they<00:02:37.890> said<00:02:38.100> because

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
a puzzle map type deal they said because

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860

there's<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> big<00:02:38.790> central<00:02:39.270> point<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> I

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
there's a big central point for it I

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.630 
there's a big central point for it I
think<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:40.530> gonna<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.739> really<00:02:40.890> interesting<00:02:41.160> I

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
think it's gonna be really interesting I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.000 
think it's gonna be really interesting I
would<00:02:41.850> recommend<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.050> far<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.800> you're

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
would recommend it so far but if you're

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.650 
would recommend it so far but if you're
holding<00:02:44.280> out<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.850> don't<00:02:45.060> want<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.270> go

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
holding out because you don't want to go
