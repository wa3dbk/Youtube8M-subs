we<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:17.039> an<00:00:17.279> innovative<00:00:17.820> feature

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
we actually have an innovative feature

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.720 
we actually have an innovative feature
which<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.630> unique<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.470> note<00:00:19.680> 3<00:00:20.039> which<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
which is unique to the note 3 which is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.470 
which is unique to the note 3 which is
signature<00:00:21.720> input<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.220> device<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
signature input on the device so I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320 
signature input on the device so I
actually<00:00:24.660> write<00:00:25.109> using<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> s-pen<00:00:26.330> my

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
variety of different options so if I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
variety of different options so if I

at<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> top<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.030> screen<00:00:42.660> lock<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> at

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
at the top we have screen lock and at

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.889 
at the top we have screen lock and at
the<00:00:43.320> moment<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.890> signature<00:00:44.460> unlock<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the moment I have signature unlock if I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
the moment I have signature unlock if I
tap<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.910> already<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
tap on this because I already have a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.779 
tap on this because I already have a
screen<00:00:48.690> lock<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> place<00:00:49.289> there's<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.340> secure

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
screen lock in place there's more secure

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
screen lock in place there's more secure
than<00:00:51.030> nothing<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.660> need<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> enter<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.289> pin<00:00:52.620> code

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
than nothing I need to enter my pin code

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.000 
than nothing I need to enter my pin code
to<00:00:53.219> proceed<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> click<00:00:54.809> ok<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.770> can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to proceed so I click ok and now I can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
to proceed so I click ok and now I can
make<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> relevant<00:00:56.699> changes<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
make the relevant changes but you can

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.319 
make the relevant changes but you can
see<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.070> we've<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.250> different<00:00:59.760> security

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
see that we've got different security

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
see that we've got different security
types<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> select<00:01:01.379> none<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
types here so if I select none and if I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.780 
types here so if I select none and if I
power<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> screen<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.610> into

power the screen off to get back into

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
power the screen off to get back into
the<00:01:05.939> device<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.510> simply<00:01:06.900> press<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> power

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the device I just simply press the power

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.710 
the device I just simply press the power
button<00:01:07.680> I'm<00:01:08.070> straight<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.850> nothing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
button I'm straight back in nothing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.270 
button I'm straight back in nothing
stopped<00:01:10.049> me<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.670> if<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:11.970> change<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
stopped me there if I then change it to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
stopped me there if I then change it to
swipe<00:01:14.479> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.990> more<00:01:16.320> enhanced<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
swipe this is a bit more enhanced in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
swipe this is a bit more enhanced in
some<00:01:17.310> respects<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.090> anyone<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.140> still<00:01:19.409> get

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
some respects but anyone can still get

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.060 
some respects but anyone can still get
in<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.159> power<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.650> press<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.920> now

in so if I power it off I press it I now

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
in so if I power it off I press it I now
get<00:01:23.250> presented<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.880> screen<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
get presented with this screen but I
need<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.070> swipe<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:28.790> then

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
need to swipe and then I'm in I then

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
need to swipe and then I'm in I then
have<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.420> signature<00:01:30.930> method<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.500> I've

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
have the signature method which I've

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.270 
have the signature method which I've
shown<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.020> moment<00:01:34.380> ago<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> go

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shown you a moment ago but if you go

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.469 
shown you a moment ago but if you go
into<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.729> actually<00:01:35.970> low<00:01:36.150> security

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
into there it's actually low security

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
into there it's actually low security
and<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.530> enter<00:01:37.920> your

and what you do is you enter your

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390 
and what you do is you enter your
signature<00:01:38.939> three<00:01:39.329> times<00:01:40.040> but<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.159> match

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
signature three times but they match

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
signature three times but they match
your<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:41.939> allowed<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> proceed<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
your then allowed to proceed you have to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
your then allowed to proceed you have to
enter<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> backup<00:01:44.009> pin<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
enter a backup pin and then when you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850 
enter a backup pin and then when you
lock<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> screen<00:01:45.810> you'll<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> box<00:01:46.649> as

device on in this video so I'm going to
come<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:54.560> if<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:55.979> back<00:01:56.189> in

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
come out of that if I then go back in

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
come out of that if I then go back in
I've<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.850> pattern<00:01:57.299> lock<00:01:57.509> which<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.990> may<00:01:58.140> have

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I've got pattern lock which you may have

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.109 
I've got pattern lock which you may have
seen<00:01:58.290> before<00:01:58.680> where<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.219> simply<00:01:59.820> draw<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
seen before where you simply draw a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.870 
seen before where you simply draw a
pattern<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> screen<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
pattern on the screen like so you do it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
pattern on the screen like so you do it
once<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> confirm<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
once and then you have to confirm it a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.330 
once and then you have to confirm it a
second<00:02:05.549> time<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.969> click<00:02:06.180> continue

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
second time so I click continue

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
second time so I click continue
it's<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> double<00:02:08.759> check<00:02:09.149> procedure<00:02:09.690> if

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's like a double check procedure if

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
it's like a double check procedure if
you're<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.500> happy<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> click<00:02:11.160> cancel<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you're not happy you click cancel and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.220 
you're not happy you click cancel and
you<00:02:12.000> can't<00:02:12.239> come<00:02:12.450> back<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you can't come back out of it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770 
you can't come back out of it
but<00:02:13.530> confirm<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
but confirm and because it's a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.449 
but confirm and because it's a
relatively<00:02:16.140> low<00:02:16.500> level<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> security<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
relatively low level of security you

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.850 
relatively low level of security you
have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.760> enter<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> backup<00:02:18.450> pit<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.080> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
have to enter a backup pit and so you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.100 
have to enter a backup pit and so you
enter<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.190> once<00:02:20.690> change<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.959> your

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
enter that once change it to your

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.660 
enter that once change it to your
heart's<00:02:22.319> content<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.860> cancel<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.459> back

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
heart's content with cancel or back

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.670 
heart's content with cancel or back
click<00:02:24.390> continue<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.140> enter<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.830> once<00:02:26.040> more

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
click continue you enter it once more

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.830 
click continue you enter it once more
and<00:02:28.680> that's<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.129> pattern<00:02:29.610> lock<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:30.360> enabled

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and that's the pattern lock now enabled

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.979 
and that's the pattern lock now enabled
so<00:02:31.049> if<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.730> lock<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.849> screen<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.599> enter

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
so if I lock the screen I have to enter

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.470 
so if I lock the screen I have to enter
this<00:02:34.140> pattern<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.769> get<00:02:34.890> into<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.360> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
this pattern to get into it if I want to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.449 
this pattern to get into it if I want to
then<00:02:36.660> make<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> change<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.530> click<00:02:37.739> back<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.129> here

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
then make a change I click back in here

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.699 
then make a change I click back in here
but<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.329> enter<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.810> pattern<00:02:40.560> lock

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
but I have to enter the pattern lock

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.030 
but I have to enter the pattern lock
again<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.819> able<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> make<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.390> change<00:02:42.659> I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
again to be able to make the change I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400 
again to be able to make the change I
can<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.220> go<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.579> pin<00:02:44.940> bit<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.200> saw

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
can then go to the pin bit like you saw

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.170 
can then go to the pin bit like you saw
me<00:02:46.440> doing<00:02:46.709> with<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.190> pattern<00:02:47.549> lock<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.849> enter

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
me doing with the pattern lock you enter

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.940 
me doing with the pattern lock you enter
the<00:02:48.299> pin<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.629> you<00:02:48.750> want<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.700> enter<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> twice

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
the pin that you want you enter it twice

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.199 
the pin that you want you enter it twice
providing<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.010> matches<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.549> click<00:02:53.790> OK

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
providing it matches and you click OK

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.960 
providing it matches and you click OK
that's<00:02:54.750> now<00:02:54.989> set<00:02:55.379> so<00:02:55.799> when<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:58.819> press<00:02:59.819> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that's now set so when I press the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.660 
that's now set so when I press the
screen<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:00.660> need<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.049> enter<00:03:01.170> my<00:03:01.769> pin

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
screen on I now need to enter my pin

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.990 
screen on I now need to enter my pin

a<00:03:06.030> change<00:03:06.390> I'm<00:03:06.510> going<00:03:06.629> to<00:03:06.690> go<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.840> password<00:03:07.410> now

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
a change I'm going to go to password now

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.920 
a change I'm going to go to password now
but<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.910> allow<00:03:09.060> me<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.629> need<00:03:09.840> to

finally password this is the highest

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.809 
finally password this is the highest
level<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.410> security<00:03:16.680> where<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.459> can<00:03:17.669> actually

level of security where you can actually
do<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.419> mix<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:19.459> numerics<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:21.470> characters<00:03:22.470> so

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.920 
do a mix of numerics and characters so
I'm<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.609> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.849> go<00:03:23.940> quite<00:03:24.269> simple<00:03:24.750> here
