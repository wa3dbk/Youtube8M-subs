low in fat and not taste so good so

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.370 
low in fat and not taste so good so
again<00:01:59.400> go<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.760> like<00:01:59.910> a<00:01:59.940> light<00:02:00.300> mayonnaise<00:02:00.600> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380

the secret ingredient we're going to use

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.890 
the secret ingredient we're going to use
is<00:02:15.240> plain<00:02:15.690> low-fat<00:02:16.370> yogurt<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.720> going<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
is plain low-fat yogurt this is going to
