pretty sure this is a five pack and the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.610 
pretty sure this is a five pack and the
color<00:04:07.670> comes<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.269> a<00:04:08.299> pumpkin<00:04:08.540> seed<00:04:08.840> color

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.129

if you guys fall kicking their backs TV
on<00:05:13.650> YouTube<00:05:14.130> this<00:05:14.789> thing<00:05:15.000> called<00:05:15.180> wobble<00:05:15.510> head

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
on YouTube this thing called wobble head

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.469 
on YouTube this thing called wobble head
this<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.870> kind<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.080> like<00:05:16.199> it<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:17.220> once<00:05:18.180> on<00:05:18.360> the

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
this is kind of like it so once on the

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.230 
this is kind of like it so once on the
bottom<00:05:18.780> your<00:05:19.260> bait<00:05:19.470> just<00:05:19.880> goes<00:05:20.880> back<00:05:21.060> and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
bottom your bait just goes back and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.860 
bottom your bait just goes back and
forth<00:05:21.320> side<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.349> side<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:24.240> its<00:05:24.630> free-swinging

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
forth side to side so its free-swinging

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.779 
forth side to side so its free-swinging
so<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:25.740> don't<00:05:25.889> really<00:05:25.949> have<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.220> move<00:05:26.699> your

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
so you don't really have to move your

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.330 
so you don't really have to move your
rod<00:05:27.000> as<00:05:27.120> much<00:05:27.330> but<00:05:28.110> just<00:05:28.800> until<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.130> bottom

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
rod as much but just until the bottom

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.150 
rod as much but just until the bottom
like<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:30.210> your<00:05:30.330> bait<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:30.979> moves<00:05:31.979> on

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
like that and your bait just moves on

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.490 
like that and your bait just moves on
some<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:32.610> that's<00:05:32.729> really<00:05:32.940> cool<00:05:33.150> we<00:05:34.050> got<00:05:34.169> two<00:05:34.380> of

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500
