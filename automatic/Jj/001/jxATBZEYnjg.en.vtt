00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.280
 I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 you 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.650
 guillaume neyrolles from entrepreneurs to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 bayreuth in bavaria in the south of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.280
 Germany is the first of our 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 customers to have taken possession of a 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.630
 new 8000 series forage harvester we him 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.340
 let's visit a few more weeks 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.610
 late while he's working on a 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 biogas production unit 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 we are on the installation of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 biogas production stefan koessler 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.440
 to foug condor the capacity of this unit 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.660
 about 650 kilowatts 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.580
 we harvested cereals 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.800
 immature triticale with a mixture 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.110
 of rye of course the customer is waiting 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 a high quality a good quality of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.080
 cut a clean thatch field and with 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.150
 this machine 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.270
 it is possible to obtain a length 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.829
 cutting very short elsewhere 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 was expecting a lot from the new series 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 8000 they were looking for reliability 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.309
 durability and excellent 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 fuel consumption 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.550
 7 years performances they dare 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 does it better meet its requirements by 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.320
 compared to his previous machine 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.610
 unlike the old series 77 56 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.159
 this new forage harvester can reach 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.759
 a visibly higher flow rate as soon as 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.590
 beginning of the harvest even in the grass 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 with the characteristics of its engine 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 it is possible to obtain a return 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.679
 20 to 30% higher than the other 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.939
 machine is now with the wake 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.920
 immature cereals 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.140
 the harvest is obviously much more 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.819
 easy and fast 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.590
 my expectations are fully met 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.569
 when I received the zweibrücken machine 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.250
 I asked that the relationship between the 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.140
 fuel consumption and flow 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.619
 be further reduced on the news 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.959
 machinery 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.429
 the fuel and do and I think that 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.530
 this machine offering a better 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.240
 yield to provide a length of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.250
 shorter cut for a quantity of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 equal or lower fuel 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.390
 several team members 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.700
 engineering and marketing observes 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.799
 also his lending business he 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.970
 hope that jürgen is the first of a 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.560
 long list of satisfied customers from 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.030
 many actors are concerned with a 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.859
 side there are the end customers of 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.510
 entrepreneurs namely power plants 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.280
 biogas production or farms 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.290
 on the other hand, 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.700
 entrepreneurs but all consider well 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.430
 sure that performance and efficiency 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.200
 are absolutely essential 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.020
 as you can see today the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.910
 quality of the harvest is paramount 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.800
 for a non- biogas plant 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.740
 wake must be cut to a height of 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.020
 3 mm with the new series 8000 it's 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.580
 possible the development of this former 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.810
 lowe's took many years and its 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.240
 design has been gradually 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.770
 improved we did not want to launch this 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.510
 machine on the market that when 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.720
 would be ready and today is the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.880
 case 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.990
 the first six are now 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.910
 at work in the fields and 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.710
 customers declare themselves very enthusiastic 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.870
 now we are waiting with 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.680
 looking forward to his successful launch on the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.330
 market I really recommend this 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.400
 machine only for its design 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.170
 it is clear that the structure of 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.770
 the machine has been the subject of reflections 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.390
 depth 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:21.620
 I think that in the future we will have 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.270
 a lot of fun with it setting 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.400
 point of the 8000 series was a 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.820
 incredible journey over the five 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.820
 last years 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.769
 we tested it for over twenty 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.379
 thousand hours of the high plains 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.019
 from Arizona to the rolling hills of 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.180
 new zealand maize back from italy to 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.370
 the lush and thick grass of the kingdom 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.829
 united and production units of 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.629
 biogas from northern germany to 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.629
 Argentine cattle farms 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.590
 we want to thank warmly 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.590
 all our customers 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.750
 we could not have achieved it are 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.470
 your help your advice and your 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.440
 encouragements 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.690
 the new 8000 series now defines 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.210
 a new standard for the new 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.210
 generation of which 6 2 thank you
