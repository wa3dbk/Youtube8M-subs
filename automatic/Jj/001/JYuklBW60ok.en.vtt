00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
having over over 25 somewhere i think

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.550 
having over over 25 somewhere i think
it's<00:04:55.400> around<00:04:55.520> 27<00:04:56.180> or<00:04:56.240> 28<00:04:56.330> students<00:04:56.990> uptrend<00:04:57.380> so

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
it's around 27 or 28 students uptrend so

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.850 
it's around 27 or 28 students uptrend so
far<00:04:59.710> you<00:05:00.710> know<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:01.430> not<00:05:01.580> an<00:05:01.700> easy<00:05:01.820> thing

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
far you know it's not an easy thing

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.980 
far you know it's not an easy thing
he'll<00:05:03.860> find<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.310> out<00:05:04.550> when<00:05:04.820> he<00:05:05.600> gets<00:05:05.810> his
