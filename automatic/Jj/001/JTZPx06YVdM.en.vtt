00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
of my previous videos but I don't think

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
of my previous videos but I don't think
we're<00:00:18.060> necessarily<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:19.529> hundred<00:00:20.130> percent

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
we're necessarily a hundred percent

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.509 
we're necessarily a hundred percent
clear<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.109> i<00:00:22.109> also<00:00:22.439> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> talk<00:00:22.859> about<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
new add-on that i'm using well i've been
using<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.400> while<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.300> an

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480

fix<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.300> think<00:00:31.260> everybody<00:00:31.710> should<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.949> using

fix I think everybody should be using

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.660 
fix I think everybody should be using
this<00:00:32.520> unless<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.149> specifically<00:00:34.670> interferes

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this unless it specifically interferes

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.799 
this unless it specifically interferes
with<00:00:36.329> something<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.920> oh<00:00:38.809> well

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
dealing abilities I wanted to make sure

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.040 
dealing abilities I wanted to make sure
that<00:00:51.360> people<00:00:51.780> understood<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.570> can't

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that people understood that you can't

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.760 
that people understood that you can't
put<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.949> silencing<00:00:56.670> shot<00:00:56.910> after<00:00:57.629> steady<00:00:58.469> shot

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
put a silencing shot after steady shot

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.529 
put a silencing shot after steady shot
it<00:00:59.190> only<00:00:59.399> applies<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> steady<00:01:00.149> shot<00:01:00.390> because

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it only applies to steady shot because

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
it only applies to steady shot because
the<00:01:00.719> only<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> cast<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
the only thing with a cast you have to
put<00:01:02.430> silencing<00:01:02.879> shot<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.180> killed<00:01:03.300> come<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
put silencing shot and killed come in be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.800 
put silencing shot and killed come in be
four<00:01:04.409> steady<00:01:04.769> shot<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:06.150> silencing<00:01:06.630> shot

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
four steady shot or the silencing shot

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.679 
four steady shot or the silencing shot
is<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> cast<00:01:07.770> until<00:01:08.479> after<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is not going to cast until after the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
is not going to cast until after the
steady<00:01:09.930> shot<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.590> lose<00:01:10.830> silencing<00:01:11.460> shots

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
steady shot and you lose silencing shots

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.149 
steady shot and you lose silencing shots
that<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> put<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.860> I'm

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that way so you want to put it like I'm

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.580 
that way so you want to put it like I'm
showing<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> put

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
showing you right now you want to put

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.120 
showing you right now you want to put
them<00:01:16.770> before<00:01:17.610> steady<00:01:18.479> shot<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.560> when<00:01:19.979> you're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
them before steady shot so when you're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
them before steady shot so when you're
going<00:01:20.520> through<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.850> rotation<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.869> going

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
going through your rotation it's going

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.160 
going through your rotation it's going
to<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.290> something<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.170> if

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to look something like this and if

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.679 
to look something like this and if
you're<00:01:25.590> using<00:01:25.799> Omni<00:01:26.250> cc<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.670> even<00:01:27.210> probably

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you're using Omni cc or even probably

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
you're using Omni cc or even probably
the<00:01:28.170> standard<00:01:29.570> Wow<00:01:30.770> bars<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the standard Wow bars you're going to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.620 
the standard Wow bars you're going to
get<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.299> timer<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.290> steady<00:01:34.920> shot<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:36.060> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
get a timer on your steady shot but you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
get a timer on your steady shot but you
can<00:01:36.840> still<00:01:37.079> cast<00:01:37.409> steady<00:01:37.920> shot<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.520> just

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
can still cast steady shot that's just

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350 
can still cast steady shot that's just
the<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.259> cool-down<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:41.360> silencing

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the that's just a cool-down of silencing

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.280 
the that's just a cool-down of silencing
shot<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.119> says<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.659> can't<00:01:46.020> cast

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
shot so you can see it says I can't cast

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
shot so you can see it says I can't cast
for<00:01:46.619> another<00:01:46.829> 15<00:01:47.220> seconds<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:47.939> clearly

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
for another 15 seconds but I'm clearly

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
for another 15 seconds but I'm clearly
casting<00:01:48.840> steady<00:01:49.470> shot<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.799> other

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
casting steady shot right now the other

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
casting steady shot right now the other
thing<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.189> wanted<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> talk<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:54.149> that

but what it does is I'm not going to go

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
but what it does is I'm not going to go
into<00:02:10.739> detail<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.670> essentially<00:02:12.230> takes<00:02:13.230> out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
into detail but it essentially takes out

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.480 
into detail but it essentially takes out
step<00:02:13.940> when<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.680> blizzard<00:02:16.680> servers<00:02:17.250> are

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
step when the blizzard servers are

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.410 
step when the blizzard servers are
communicating<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.390> your<00:02:19.110> computer<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.730> it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
communicating with your computer and it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.449 
communicating with your computer and it
will<00:02:21.720> significantly<00:02:22.590> reduce<00:02:23.069> your<00:02:23.970> ms<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:26.310> on

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
will significantly reduce your ms I'm on

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.010 
will significantly reduce your ms I'm on
the<00:02:26.550> East<00:02:26.700> Coast<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.720> West<00:02:27.930> Coast

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the East Coast and this is a West Coast

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.900 
the East Coast and this is a West Coast
server<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.770> my<00:02:29.730> latency<00:02:30.090> used<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:30.989> around

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
server and my latency used to be around

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.400 
server and my latency used to be around
300<00:02:32.910> may<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.450> higher<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:34.050> over

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
300 may be a little higher a little over

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.890 
300 may be a little higher a little over
but<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:35.730> I'm<00:02:36.090> running<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.840> 133<00:02:37.770> ms<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.000> more

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.250

definitely<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> lot<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.730> help<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.840> you'll<00:02:45.989> see

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
definitely a lot of help and you'll see

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.720 
definitely a lot of help and you'll see
your<00:02:46.620> damage<00:02:47.100> go<00:02:47.489> up<00:02:47.670> quite<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.570> bit<00:02:48.810> um<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:50.519> can

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
your damage go up quite a bit um it can

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.540 
your damage go up quite a bit um it can
interfere<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.660> few<00:02:52.050> abstract<00:02:53.040> scripts

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
interfere with a few abstract scripts

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.060 
interfere with a few abstract scripts
but<00:02:54.150> most<00:02:54.600> people<00:02:55.080> aren't<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.769> have<00:02:55.860> to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
but most people aren't going to have to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.970 
but most people aren't going to have to
worry<00:02:56.250> about<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:58.290> last<00:02:58.500> thing<00:02:58.709> that
