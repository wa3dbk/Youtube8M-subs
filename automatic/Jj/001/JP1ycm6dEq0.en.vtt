bloody<00:00:30.689> useless<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> only<00:00:32.969> trouble<00:00:33.149> with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
bloody useless the only trouble with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
bloody useless the only trouble with
this<00:00:33.660> thing<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.340> helmet

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this thing is when it's on your helmet

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
this thing is when it's on your helmet
you<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.120> loads<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.570> loads<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.899> wind

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you just get loads and loads of wind

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
you just get loads and loads of wind
noise<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.340> newer<00:00:38.520> ones<00:00:38.790> are

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
noise and I think the newer ones are

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.869 
noise and I think the newer ones are
exactly<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> same<00:00:39.510> aren't<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.700> or<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
exactly the same aren't they or is it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:42.950 
exactly the same aren't they or is it
the<00:00:42.000> ghost<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.660> called<00:00:42.809> with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the ghost I think it's called with

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
the ghost I think it's called with
something<00:00:43.230> might<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.219> wrong<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.760> one

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
something might be wrong on that one

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.029 
something might be wrong on that one
don't<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:45.840> wrong<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:47.690> yeah<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.559> it'd<00:00:49.920> be

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
don't get me wrong but yeah so it'd be

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
don't get me wrong but yeah so it'd be
nice<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.030> separate<00:00:51.510> microphone<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
nice to have a separate microphone and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
nice to have a separate microphone and
you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.770> shove<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.280> helmet<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.850> do

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you can shove it in your helmet and do

can<00:02:23.870> really<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.410> what's<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.860> on<00:02:25.180> that

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
can really see what's going on that

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.850 
can really see what's going on that
silicone<00:02:27.799> seal<00:02:28.900> there<00:02:29.900> where<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> microphone

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
silicone seal there where the microphone

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.050 
silicone seal there where the microphone
is<00:02:31.250> was<00:02:32.209> thicker<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:33.350> will<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.250> trim

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
is was thicker you will have to trim

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.830 
is was thicker you will have to trim
that<00:02:35.090> down<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.489> cut<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.120> bit<00:02:38.390> off<00:02:38.570> that's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
that down so you cut that bit off that's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.220 
that down so you cut that bit off that's
on<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.140> inside<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.580> in<00:02:40.700> other<00:02:40.790> words<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:42.019> your

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
on the inside so in other words get your

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.400 
on the inside so in other words get your
knife<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:44.830> trim<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.100> down<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.750> ok

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
knife and trim that down like that ok

then get your small screwdriver and
pierce<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.560> hole<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.269> alright<00:02:53.269> not<00:02:53.989> as<00:02:54.230> big

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
pierce a hole in it alright not as big

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.250 
pierce a hole in it alright not as big
as<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.950> 3.5<00:02:55.820> suck<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.840> needs<00:02:57.080> to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
as the 3.5 suck it because it needs to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.280 
as the 3.5 suck it because it needs to
fit<00:02:57.470> tightly<00:02:57.799> around<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.660> ok<00:02:59.660> have<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.080> got

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
fit tightly around it ok have you got

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.890 
fit tightly around it ok have you got
all<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:01.730> straightforward<00:03:02.150> enough<00:03:02.690> it

taking<00:03:05.810> apart<00:03:06.019> what<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.410> mean<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.190> next<00:03:07.430> thing

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
taking apart what I mean the next thing

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.940 
taking apart what I mean the next thing
you've<00:03:07.700> got<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:07.940> do<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.170> cut<00:03:09.709> those

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
you've got to do is to just cut those

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.810 
you've got to do is to just cut those
wires<00:03:10.450> cut<00:03:11.450> them<00:03:11.600> as<00:03:11.690> long<00:03:11.840> as<00:03:11.959> possible

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
wires cut them as long as possible

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.350 
wires cut them as long as possible
there's<00:03:13.820> one

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.100 

too<00:03:16.570> much<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.110> little<00:03:17.380> microphone<00:03:17.650> just<00:03:18.610> there

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
too much a little microphone just there

too much a little microphone just there
okay<00:03:20.460> that's<00:03:21.460> somewhere<00:03:21.850> not<00:03:22.210> be<00:03:22.420> going<00:03:22.570> to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
okay that's somewhere not be going to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.260

all right there you go guys can you see
that<00:03:30.190> I've<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.730> soldered<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:32.380> socket<00:03:33.040> to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
that I've just soldered that socket to

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.740 
that I've just soldered that socket to
the<00:03:33.940> two<00:03:34.150> wires<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.440> see<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.600> have

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
the two wires can you see you can have

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.420 
the two wires can you see you can have
to<00:03:37.870> be<00:03:37.990> quite<00:03:38.230> good<00:03:38.470> at<00:03:38.590> solving<00:03:38.830> because<00:03:39.280> he's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
to be quite good at solving because he's

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.790 
to be quite good at solving because he's
really<00:03:39.850> really<00:03:40.180> really<00:03:40.540> tiny<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.380> if<00:03:41.650> you're

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
really really really tiny so if you're

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.350 
really really really tiny so if you're
not<00:03:41.890> good<00:03:42.070> at<00:03:42.100> sold<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.610> done<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:42.880> tempest<00:03:43.180> job

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
not good at sold and done it tempest job

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.910 
not good at sold and done it tempest job
anyway<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.320> there<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.530> go<00:03:44.590> that's<00:03:44.830> that<00:03:45.100> on

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
anyway so there you go that's that on

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.160 
anyway so there you go that's that on
right<00:03:47.920> here's<00:03:48.250> another<00:03:48.459> shot<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.690> actual

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
right here's another shot of the actual

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.530 
right here's another shot of the actual
mono<00:03:52.680> socket<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.030> unit<00:03:55.450> itself

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
mono socket in the in the unit itself

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.020 
mono socket in the in the unit itself
can<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.290> see<00:03:56.500> only<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:57.160> fits<00:03:57.520> there's<00:03:57.850> not<00:03:58.000> a
