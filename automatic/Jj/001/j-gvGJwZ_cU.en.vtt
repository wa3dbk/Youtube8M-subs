about this was curious about the 2 X

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.690 
about this was curious about the 2 X
that<00:00:05.730> appears<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.589> the<00:00:07.589> or<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> double<00:00:08.400> points

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
that appears in the or the double points

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.410 
that appears in the or the double points
or<00:00:08.760> whatever<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.000> want<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.150> call<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.300> that

or whatever you want to call it that
appears<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.260> map<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.710> origins<00:00:11.099> after<00:00:11.790> you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
appears in the map of origins after you

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.240 
appears in the map of origins after you
start<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.509> first<00:00:12.840> generator<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.710> what

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
start the first generator and what

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.829 
start the first generator and what
happens<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> after<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.210> go<00:00:15.420> ahead<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.690> start

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
happens is after you go ahead and start

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.480 
happens is after you go ahead and start
this<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.049> you're<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> notice<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.340> in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this one you're going to notice that in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
this one you're going to notice that in
the<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:18.150> mystery<00:00:18.420> box<00:00:18.630> thing<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the little mystery box thing the the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.920 
the little mystery box thing the the
double<00:00:20.160> points<00:00:20.490> will<00:00:20.820> show<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> wanted

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
double points will show up and I wanted

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
double points will show up and I wanted
to<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.859> long<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.250> stays<00:00:23.640> there

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to know how long it actually stays there

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.460 
to know how long it actually stays there
for<00:00:24.420> some<00:00:24.570> reason<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.930> always<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.350> thought

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
for some reason I always just thought

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.040 
for some reason I always just thought
maybe<00:00:25.800> hey<00:00:26.099> might<00:00:26.490> uh<00:00:26.519> might<00:00:27.300> disappear<00:00:27.750> after

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
maybe hey might uh might disappear after

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
maybe hey might uh might disappear after
the<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:28.320> round<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.920> wanted<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> give<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the first round but I wanted to give it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.659 
the first round but I wanted to give it
a<00:00:29.670> test<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:31.040> you'll<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a test and see and you'll see that it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.190 
a test and see and you'll see that it
actually<00:00:32.700> does<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.329> disappear<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> first

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
actually does not disappear in the first

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.280 
actually does not disappear in the first
round<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:36.300> doesn't<00:00:36.600> disappear<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> third

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
round it doesn't disappear in the third

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590 
round it doesn't disappear in the third
round<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.010> fourth<00:00:38.550> round<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.270> actually

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
round or this fourth round it actually

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.600 
round or this fourth round it actually
stays<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.260> long<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:41.629> as<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:44.040> pick

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
stays there as long as as you don't pick

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.979 
stays there as long as as you don't pick
it<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:46.170> why<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> what

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it up and I don't know why and and what

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.660 
it up and I don't know why and and what
the<00:00:49.079> purpose<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.800> maybe<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the purpose is but maybe what if it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
the purpose is but maybe what if it
turned<00:00:50.879> into<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.180> magical<00:00:51.629> that'd<00:00:52.530> be

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
turned into something magical that'd be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.010 
turned into something magical that'd be
kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> cool<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.180> sure<00:00:54.390> leave<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
kind of cool I'm not sure leave a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
kind of cool I'm not sure leave a
comment<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.500> guys<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:56.010> left<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> 2x

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
here longer especially in solo and let

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
here longer especially in solo and let
me<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.660> thoughts<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.140> I'm

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
me know what your thoughts are but I'm

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.049 
me know what your thoughts are but I'm
showing<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> guys<00:01:02.280> basically<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.969> I'm

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
showing you guys basically here I'm

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.280 
showing you guys basically here I'm
going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> speed<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
going to speed it up a little bit and do

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.310 
going to speed it up a little bit and do
two<00:01:04.979> times<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> basically<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> figured

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
two times here but I basically I figured

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.149 
two times here but I basically I figured
you<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:07.920> ahead<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you know what I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.200 
you know what I'm going to go ahead and
try<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> boxes<00:01:11.210> completed

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
try to get one of the boxes completed

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.460 
try to get one of the boxes completed
one<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> challenges<00:01:12.930> completed<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
one of the challenges completed so I

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
one of the challenges completed so I
went<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.310> eventually<00:01:14.970> turned<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
went and I eventually turned on all of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
went and I eventually turned on all of
the<00:01:15.960> power<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> wanted<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> come<00:01:17.490> back

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the power and then I wanted to come back

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.070 
the power and then I wanted to come back
and<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.270> still<00:01:18.360> available<00:01:18.479> when

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and see if it was still available when

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.330 
and see if it was still available when
you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.560> icon<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.189> lower

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you have that little icon on the lower

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
you have that little icon on the lower
left-hand<00:01:20.700> side<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.380> ahead

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
left-hand side and I'm going to go ahead

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.730 
left-hand side and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:22.619> show<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.950> guys<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.320> still

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and show you guys that it actually still

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.640 
and show you guys that it actually still
stays<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.689> sure<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
stays there so I'm not sure the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.140 
stays there so I'm not sure the
significance<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> maybe<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> no

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
significance of it maybe there is no

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.240 
significance of it maybe there is no
significance<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.439> probably<00:01:31.740> best<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> use

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
significance it's probably best to use

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.740 
significance it's probably best to use
it<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.490> earlier<00:01:32.790> rounds<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.450> trying<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it in earlier rounds but I was trying to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
it in earlier rounds but I was trying to
see<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.350> there's<00:01:34.619> any<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> could<00:01:35.070> use<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
see if there's any way I could use it to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
see if there's any way I could use it to
my<00:01:35.549> advantage<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> did<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.920> game

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
my advantage and what I did in this game

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.440 
my advantage and what I did in this game
I<00:01:38.159> ended<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.729> using<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.329> from<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.820> second<00:01:41.820> what

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
I ended up using it from the second what

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.719 
I ended up using it from the second what
was<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.829> second<00:01:44.189> round<00:01:44.280> instead<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
was it the the second round instead of

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.889 
was it the the second round instead of
the<00:01:44.790> first<00:01:44.970> round<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.360> usually<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the first round because usually I just

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
the first round because usually I just
would<00:01:46.259> use<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> first<00:01:46.829> round<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.820> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
would use in the first round but I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
would use in the first round but I
figured<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.509> knife<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
figured I just knife in the first and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.749 
figured I just knife in the first and
second<00:01:49.740> maybe<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> third<00:01:50.369> round<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.670> then

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
second maybe in the third round and then

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.270 
second maybe in the third round and then
just<00:01:50.909> shoot<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.540> collaterals<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.280> get

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
just shoot and get collaterals and get

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.410 
just shoot and get collaterals and get
some<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.520> points<00:01:53.820> from<00:01:53.909> us<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.360> but

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
some more points from us that way but

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
some more points from us that way but
really<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> exit<00:01:56.100> sits<00:01:56.340> there

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
really it's just a to exit sits there

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
really it's just a to exit sits there
and<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.880> don't<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.299> there's<00:01:57.509> again<00:01:57.960> any

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and I don't know if there's again any

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
and I don't know if there's again any
significant<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> last<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
significant so this is the last one that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.580 
significant so this is the last one that
I<00:02:00.390> met<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.600> powering<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
I met at powering I know it's not the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
I met at powering I know it's not the
six<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.280> fifth<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> last<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.360> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
six the fifth one that is last one I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.969 
six the fifth one that is last one I
powered<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:04.170> look<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> lower<00:02:04.680> left<00:02:04.890> hand

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
powered now look at the lower left hand

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.390 
powered now look at the lower left hand
side<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.969> ended<00:02:06.509> up<00:02:06.570> getting<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
side you can see I ended up getting the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.670 
side you can see I ended up getting the
the<00:02:07.640> unlock<00:02:08.000> or<00:02:08.180> whatever<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:08.690> turning<00:02:09.590> all

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
the unlock or whatever for turning all

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.020 
the unlock or whatever for turning all
the<00:02:09.710> power<00:02:09.920> on<00:02:10.040> which<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.310> believe<00:02:10.490> is<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.850> max

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the power on which I believe is the max

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.430 
the power on which I believe is the max
ammo<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.570> then<00:02:12.020> I'm<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.260> come<00:02:12.380> back

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
ammo and then I'm going to come back

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.560 
ammo and then I'm going to come back
here<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:13.040> see<00:02:13.250> right<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.580> it's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
here and you can see right here it's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.930 
here and you can see right here it's
still<00:02:14.750> here<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.110> around<00:02:15.290> seven<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
still here on around seven so I just I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.330 
still here on around seven so I just I
didn't<00:02:17.210> end<00:02:17.300> up<00:02:17.390> taking<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.720> reward<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
didn't end up taking the reward and I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.510 
didn't end up taking the reward and I
ants<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.330> did<00:02:20.660> complete<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.020> challenge<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.340> so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
ants I did complete the challenge and so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920 
ants I did complete the challenge and so
I<00:02:22.760> thought<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.360> would<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.600> eventually

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
I thought it would just eventually

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.390 
I thought it would just eventually
disappear<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.710> doesn't<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.370> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
disappear but it doesn't you know I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.650 
disappear but it doesn't you know I
thought<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.820> was<00:02:25.940> kind<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.180> interesting<00:02:26.600> i

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
thought this was kind of interesting i

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
thought this was kind of interesting i
