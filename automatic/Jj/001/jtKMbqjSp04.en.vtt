00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.299

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.100
 man and well before you start with 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.020
 this video I want to thank you all 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.019
 the people who watch my videos thanks 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.639
 to see them especially also to the 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.040
 thousand subscribers for the support they have given me 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.650
 given comment on all this in my videos 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.390
 throughout this time and also the 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.250
 people who do not see my videos that do not 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.380
 like it also because as this 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.810
 youtube and there you like it in August if there 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.380
 people who like it and people who do not 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.320
 they like it 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.689
 I think I 'm still new I'm going 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.329
 learning little by little because it has 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.519
 touched having different channels 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.860
 different new consoles that never in 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:44.480
 my life I have seen other media consoles 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.629
 rare clones controls and all that and I'm going 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.540
 learning little by little still also 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.250
 then throughout this time I think 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.140
 thank you because you have supported me 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.970
 in a simple fact that you have a 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.190
 collection means how good I am 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 better than another not everything I think 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.470
 we are all here a community of 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.390
 collectors and not simple fact of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.229
 have a bigger collection there 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.560
 means that you do not do anything like that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.320
 so I also support small 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.360
 collectors and from there one begins 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.520
 so 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.870
 well, we are all a community of 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.350
 collectors 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.510
 I liked seeing a lot of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.740
 videos of certain channels in Spanish or 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:39.119
 in English great collectors like 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.119
 james wani this first video that jimÃ©nez 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.380
 different I came with a big channel a 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.380
 great collector that is that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.740
 also in Spanish, I had to see 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.930
 infinity of channels with large 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 collections that good I do not have 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 some maybe more ahead get them 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.300
 little by little things are happening 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 and as I tell you we are all one 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.579
 community here of collectors and good 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.909
 in a certain way we support 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:14.799
 comment and all that though sometimes not 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.139
 I have a lot of time because of the shortage of 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.700
 as long as I have as I have two 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.660
 then I work sometimes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.520
 impossible sometimes to watch many videos but 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.930
 and I do what I do then and so 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.440
 I made this video to thank you 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.880
 you and well then thank you and we started 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 from video I have sent several 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.270
 comments that good because no 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.010
 I have many are many video views 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.720
 I have told them that good of some 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.550
 way it does not make me I need a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.320
 little more than all the advertising 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.830
 social networks everything is like I'm not very 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.300
 fond of that then 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.740
 I sometimes tell them it's like a 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.710
 business when you open a business 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.140
 any store or I do not know you do not see the 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.540
 people so fast if you do not see with 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.860
 the time then little by little we go 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.170
 growing in this channel 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.130
 another of the things that have asked me 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.040
 What if I have 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.370
 boxes buy consoles that no 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.700
 I have all got some unfortunately 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.940
 some weeks ruin two because when I go 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.130
 moving from home times this boxes are 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.440
 they mistreat too much because I do not have left 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.630
 other than throwing them away then I've 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.290
 preserved some that I have bought 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.070
 used and some new media and for 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.070
 here I have some 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.709
 I know that sometimes it's more original 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.140
 save the console boxes because 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.230
 if you create goals your value then known 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.819
 or maybe they sell them if you earn a little money 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.620
 extra 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.319
 and good to keep some that are 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.939
 several consoles not all for and I have 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.819
 some but yes they are 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.700
 too much mistreated sometimes that 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.040
 you're interested in when this 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.569
 is one of them is the micro vision a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.400
 of the first portable consoles that 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.420
 they made this comes with all their 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.209
 instructive and everything exactly inside 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.470
 this is another box this is from the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.870
 best-selling computer of all 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.239
 times the commodore 64 friend 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.519
 has all its instructions all 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.610
 everything comes here inside something they mistreated 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:30.099
 to the box but it comes original 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:33.400
 over here I have the Saturn pattern is 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:35.110
 so everything comes all original look with 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.120
 five from within without subjective 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.310
 why in something because I have some 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.740
 things saved as agreement I keep 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.470
 things 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.270
 around here I have this one that is one of the 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:51.539
 most weird consoles 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.580
 this is the ps pc fx one of nn s a la the 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.919
 console or was not strange that was 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.920
 this also comes with all its 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.550
 instructional 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.290
 this is another console the dining room is the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.380
 only game console that came out of 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:10.190
 this mark good I'm sbs gave another that 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.700
 it was 64 console type but that's how it is 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.860
 extremely rare to face towards 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.820
 the friend cidh and this one comes with all her 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:24.210
 instructive this wake minaya of 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.560
 a friend from england is another 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.560
 procession the afternoon jaguar 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.090
 in the last console of 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.800
 would try not to have gone well in 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.110
 all your instructions all everything 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.639
 exactly inside 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.400
 here I have another one that is mine cid 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.159
 one of the last consoles that took out 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.510
 this company had taken out another one that is 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:56.370
 new city 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.540
 z that was supposedly faster to read 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.430
 the discs 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.410
 and here I have one of the consoles that 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.140
 we could make stronger from that era 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.980
 what was it is is the atari peeping to the marq 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.080
 until the Japanese version 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.800
 Well, as you see most of the 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.950
 consoles are Japanese or in this 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.770
 england like for example ss of the 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.110
 friend city and also around here I have this 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.320
 what is the pc 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.530
 one 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.680
 what is the mini console I bought it from 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.930
 new 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.850
 and I also show you how good this is 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.850
 I do not have to go to other boxes of this 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.020
 the 360 this is the ark version that 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.530
 comes from internal memory 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.540
 and there I already have several boxes no more 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.700
 that right now no 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.670
 I could not 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.810
 like the canned times in the garage 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.600
 to store things was difficult 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.630
 take them out but well these are some 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.660
 some boxes of the consoles that 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.610
 I keep that I know that sometimes that has not 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.950
 done no video I have commented on 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.440
 why do not I do a good boxing memo 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.970
 I see certain channels and so good there 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.270
 an infinity with those who do this 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.800
 kind of videos then one like that not 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.419
 be good more of me 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.699
 it's not my style to do it then 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.249
 this then in this way showing the 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.009
 console 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:30.129
 but this is some of the boxes 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:33.249
 I keep something other boxes that I have but 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:36.729
 As I tell you, it was not a little bit 

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:38.409
 difficult to get it out and well, well, this 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:42.249
 It is a video of thanks and 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:44.229
 samples of this that is the my boxes of 

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:46.509
 consoles and thanks to all my 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:48.849
