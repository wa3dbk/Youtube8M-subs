of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> building<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.799> have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
of the building is that we do have

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
of the building is that we do have
dedicated<00:01:47.159> spaces<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> students<00:01:48.689> can

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
dedicated spaces that the students can

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.359 
dedicated spaces that the students can
reserve<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.380> study<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> see

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
reserve to study would you like to see

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.830 
reserve to study would you like to see
one<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:50.880> love<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.689> way

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
one I would love to do it right this way

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710 
one I would love to do it right this way
all<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> look<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
all right let's go take a look so I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.760 
all right let's go take a look so I
think<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> things<00:01:55.470> you'll<00:01:55.619> notice

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
think one of the things you'll notice

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
think one of the things you'll notice
about<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> house<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.180> combines

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
about the house is the way it combines

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
about the house is the way it combines
the<00:01:57.869> modern<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.530> classic<00:01:59.009> architecture

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the modern and the classic architecture

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.270 
the modern and the classic architecture
concepts<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> very<00:02:01.710> open<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
concepts so that we have a very open and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920 
concepts so that we have a very open and
inviting<00:02:02.729> space<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> students<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
inviting space for the students but it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.450 
inviting space for the students but it
still<00:02:04.170> maintains<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.710> lot<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> character

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
still maintains a lot of the character

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
still maintains a lot of the character
of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> university<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.719> comes<00:02:06.990> through<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
of the university that comes through the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
of the university that comes through the
use<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.740> materials<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
use of the materials as well as the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
use of the materials as well as the
facade<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.569> breakouts

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
facade of breakouts

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.170 
facade of breakouts
so<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.590> have<00:02:11.740> four<00:02:11.950> study<00:02:12.280> rooms<00:02:12.520> total<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
so we have four study rooms total in the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.240 
so we have four study rooms total in the
building<00:02:13.540> three<00:02:14.140> are<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.800> second<00:02:15.220> floor

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
building three are on the second floor

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.580 
building three are on the second floor
where<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:16.000> were<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.660> then<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.380> this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
where we just were and then we have this

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.170 
where we just were and then we have this
one<00:02:17.830> which<00:02:17.950> overlooks<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.520> atrium<00:02:18.880> here<00:02:19.090> on

one which overlooks the atrium here on

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.760 
one which overlooks the atrium here on
the<00:02:19.300> third<00:02:19.510> floor<00:02:19.780> each<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.440> these<00:02:20.530> rooms

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
the third floor each of these rooms

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.830 
the third floor each of these rooms

so that they would want to study so we

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.780 
so that they would want to study so we
have<00:03:02.230> larger<00:03:02.680> spaces<00:03:03.100> like<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.459> where<00:03:03.670> we're

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
have larger spaces like this where we're

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.370 
have larger spaces like this where we're
sitting<00:03:03.940> now<00:03:04.120> where<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.660> have<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> couch<00:03:05.110> that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
sitting now where you have a couch that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.170 
sitting now where you have a couch that
will<00:03:05.530> hold<00:03:05.709> many<00:03:06.010> groups<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.430> students<00:03:06.760> as

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
will hold many groups of students as

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.699 
will hold many groups of students as
opposed<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.600> some<00:03:07.780> smaller<00:03:08.050> places<00:03:08.410> around

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709
