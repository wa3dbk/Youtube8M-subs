another theory video today I've got a

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.349 
another theory video today I've got a
viewer-submitted<00:00:04.920> theory<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.670> shieldon<00:00:06.180> is

viewer-submitted theory that shieldon is

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.810 
viewer-submitted theory that shieldon is
the<00:00:06.480> evolutionary<00:00:07.109> predecessor<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.099> ära

make sure to leave a like thanks for
watching<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.730> let's<00:00:12.090> get<00:00:12.300> started<00:00:12.870> now

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
watching and let's get started now

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.379 
watching and let's get started now
before<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.980> give<00:00:14.250> into<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> evidence<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.210> want

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
before I give into the evidence I want

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.269 
before I give into the evidence I want
to<00:00:15.509> explain<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> pretense<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.859> theory

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
to explain the pretense of this theory

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.609 
to explain the pretense of this theory
this<00:00:17.670> theory<00:00:18.060> stipulates<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.779> shieldon<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
this theory stipulates that shieldon is

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.470 
this theory stipulates that shieldon is
like<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> step<00:00:20.189> back<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> evolutionary

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
like a step back on the evolutionary

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.840 
like a step back on the evolutionary
tree<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.109> relation<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.590> Aaron<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.550> without

is generally in caves making another
case<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> two<00:01:49.380> Pokemon<00:01:49.920> being<00:01:50.189> related

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
case for the two Pokemon being related

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
case for the two Pokemon being related
one<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.990> thing<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.259> adds<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
one more thing that adds to this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
one more thing that adds to this
possibility<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> fact<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.450> both

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
possibility is the fact that both

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.170 
possibility is the fact that both
pokémon<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.590> their<00:01:55.799> evolutionary<00:01:56.490> lines<00:01:56.880> are

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
pokémon and their evolutionary lines are

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.990 
pokémon and their evolutionary lines are
rock<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> steel<00:01:57.990> type<00:01:58.290> Pokemon<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.759> they

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
rock and steel type Pokemon maybe they

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.289 
rock and steel type Pokemon maybe they
would<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.270> fans<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.780> hard<00:02:01.079> rock<00:02:01.409> oh<00:02:01.939> that<00:02:02.939> pun

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
would be fans of hard rock oh that pun

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.469 
would be fans of hard rock oh that pun
was<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> gem<00:02:04.200> wasn't<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> anyway<00:02:05.880> shield<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.450> his

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
was a gem wasn't it anyway shield on his

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
was a gem wasn't it anyway shield on his
primary<00:02:07.079> rock<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.710> air<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.069> his<00:02:08.220> primary

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
primary rock and air on his primary

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
primary rock and air on his primary
steel<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.690> still<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> possibility<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
steel but it's still a possibility that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.350 
steel but it's still a possibility that
has<00:02:11.099> shield<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.640> evolved<00:02:12.090> into

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
has shield on evolved into

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.150 
has shield on evolved into
Aaron<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.990> began<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.620> develop<00:02:13.860> more

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
Aaron it began to develop more

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.450 
Aaron it began to develop more
steel-like<00:02:14.550> qualities<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.650> final<00:02:17.070> piece<00:02:17.280> of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
steel-like qualities the final piece of

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.490 
steel-like qualities the final piece of
evidence<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:18.060> want<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.420> discuss<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> fact

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
evidence I want to discuss is the fact

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.160 
evidence I want to discuss is the fact
that<00:02:19.620> Aaron<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.580> iron<00:02:20.790> armor<00:02:21.420> Pokemon<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that Aaron is the iron armor Pokemon and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.230 
that Aaron is the iron armor Pokemon and
shield<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.860> acquired<00:02:23.280> by<00:02:23.430> reviving<00:02:23.940> an

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
shield on is acquired by reviving an

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.360 
shield on is acquired by reviving an
armored<00:02:24.660> fossil<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.440> can't<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.250> be

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
armored fossil that can't just be

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.820 
armored fossil that can't just be
coincidence<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.480> I'll<00:02:28.140> leave<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.800> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
coincidence can it I'll leave it up to
