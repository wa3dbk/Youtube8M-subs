I was like now I not know he's like well
I'm<00:04:37.450> going<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.630> listen<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.260> he<00:04:38.350> puts<00:04:38.380> it

in<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.950> mean<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.100> guess<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.400> could<00:04:39.520> have<00:04:39.550> been

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
in I mean I guess it could have been

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.100 
in I mean I guess it could have been
worse<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:39.910> not<00:04:40.300> much<00:04:40.480> worse<00:04:40.510> it<00:04:40.990> could<00:04:41.080> have

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
worse but not much worse it could have

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.720 
worse but not much worse it could have
been<00:04:41.230> Nickelback<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.280> what<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.430> guess<00:04:42.580> that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
been Nickelback that what I guess that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.370 
been Nickelback that what I guess that
was<00:04:42.790> about<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.030> but<00:04:43.780> needless<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.170> say<00:04:44.350> I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
was about it but needless to say I

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.080 
was about it but needless to say I
learned<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.890> lot<00:04:45.070> from<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.340> experience<00:04:45.460> it
