00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 It's fuzzy today, it 's hard to say. 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 because the fusca is a car that people of the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.480
 my age people of my generation is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 relation to the car 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.039
 the most interesting is that children who 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 they never lived a car when they see 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.359
 In love, I think the car has a 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.309
 charisma itself up to the club of the fusca

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.129
 variant all cars that use this 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 mechanical i fusca is all good, right it is not 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.210
 what it's good it's all good to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 history of the cars more than 20 years 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 There's already gasoline full of music. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.640
 It's the car that makes noises but it 's a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.220
 car that can not like you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 remembers the past since 1950 began the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 VW then you have a story 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.700
 a little piece of brazil's history 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.160
 here you will find cars of all kinds 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.050
 from the most original most equipped to 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.710
 this year we had several cars from 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.690
 50 50 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 many demoted cars are 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.430
 a lot of interesting stuff is trailer that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.260
 trailer combo this trailer is a truck 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.080
 safari which was made by karmann guide 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:47.920
 in brazil and the same mechanics of the fusca 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:49.810
 exactly is a derivative of the fusca not 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.900
 swipe here it's in the original aspect 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.870
 but it's sporty at the time, he's 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.570
 all and all sports accessories from 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.770
 season the wheel remained five holes 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.560
 the fraction 12 5 the stirrup all it just is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.080
 low suspension shortened his engine 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.740
 it was 1,200 today it is with the 1900 engine 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.810
 you walk pretty much just not for 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.310
 flu goal is that you can give a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.420
 fucked in it, right? 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.390
 sometimes the fusca has a fan yes liked 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.709
 History, you see, here's the hair. 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.850
 here's a pretty enough event. 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.820
 variety right 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.130
 but we went with people and 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.340
 from the hot box and we stay like this 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.380
 keeps the car in the original aspect 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.870
 but great sports I'll give you a 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.820
 Great team back to team 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 just be careful 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.049
 This daniel black fighter looks at this. 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.420
 even this is the perfect ladybug 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.849
 the combination of two colors right here that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.269
 happens you can shorten the suspension 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.310
 One can only bring negative 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.650
 lowering the rearview mirrors and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 also in the American albert style then 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.150
 It's different from the style that we pull. 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.560
 more for American and European, 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.700
 style is coming soon in brazil 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.989
 strong 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.430
 you can see that the sale of parts 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.750
 here in Brazil has increased 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.109
 enough 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.420
 So this is what you change, or the fusca. 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.030
 according to the personality of the owner then 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.810
 You change it according to the owner's face. 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.810
 what do you do it 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.049
 You who own the red ferrari and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.239
 that's just me 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.340
 It's an old passion that I have for 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.470
 Fuzzy even more red was always gone 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.409
 my dream of consuming red fusca 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.510
 why but what has red at 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.370
 Red is my favorite color and when 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.650
 I was small had an uncle of mine 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.169
 had a red beetle engraved and 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.720
 I always have it red 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.310
 He has a different style, right? 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.389
 will even be brought from the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.959
 germany is called were already few and is the 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.340
 style mixes the Volkswagen with parts of 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.579
 posh 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.620
 there it is very similar to the contribution 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:17.769
 Do you remember a little bit? 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.380
 the lighthouse then there and the German lighthouse is to speak 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.979
 German imported directly from Germany 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.690
 and the steering wheel is original from the court 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.870
 the music also has a smell 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.780
 Smirking with a face try everything, everything is 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.930
 different in the fusca in the search is does not have 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.930
 explanation oo 1 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.169
 You want to open the fusca is to enter. 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.610
 and get a little tricky but how is it? 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.620
 for you to enter the spindle you have to do 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.430
 I ended up juggling for myself. 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.870
 come and make a barrier display 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.580
 the head and four grandchildren 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.490
 I'm a little bit still only amount 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.470
 so that's why it 's good too 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.780
 fusca and then gets comfortable now 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.729
 after I 'm in here flyer 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.740
 do not disturb the distance it disturbs and 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.570
 is driving the problem was tasty 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.479
 in and out by steering wheel size 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.180
 because soon you will want to fusca from 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.130
 even child will always be lowest ever was 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.850
 smaller thinner camera at least in the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.510
 good time to get away from it have to have 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.830
 I'm really like who I always 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.360
 I liked it when I was a kid, my first. 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.940
 car a fusca 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.620
 After I decide, the will is 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.449
 I always buy again , I just finished. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.419
 buying legal from you 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.610
 You find people who know 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.349
 They also like fuzz, that's what we 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.880
 always do in the events 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.030
 sometimes I come with it came with the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.669
 another and you end up knowing people have 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.000
 contacts to buy parts to exchange 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.580
 to sell then is is just 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.620
 turning a friendship even those with VW 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.620
 ends up becoming friends with
