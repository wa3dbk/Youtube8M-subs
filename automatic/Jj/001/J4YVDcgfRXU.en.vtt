already<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.200> 90<00:01:19.590> degrees<00:01:19.920> come<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:20.880> around

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
already at 90 degrees come back around

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
already at 90 degrees come back around
the<00:01:21.240> other<00:01:21.299> side<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:23.900> then<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.530> splint

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the other side and then this splint

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.060 
the other side and then this splint
should<00:01:26.100> stop<00:01:26.580> proximal<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.600> mCP<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
should stop proximal to the mCP there so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
should stop proximal to the mCP there so
things<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> fingers<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.780> flex<00:01:31.110> but

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
things so that the fingers can flex but

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.020 
things so that the fingers can flex but
you're<00:01:31.890> always<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> end<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.790> being

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you're always going to end up being

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
you're always going to end up being
shorter<00:01:33.479> than<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.799> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
always give myself for long splint that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
always give myself for long splint that
wraps<00:01:37.350> around<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.650> major<00:01:37.860> joint<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> extra

wraps around a major joint and extra
couple<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.119> inches<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.960> too<00:01:40.110> long<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
couple of inches if it's too long you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.190 
couple of inches if it's too long you
can<00:01:40.530> always<00:01:41.240> fold<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> back<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.079> too

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
can always fold it back but if it's too

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.980 
can always fold it back but if it's too
short<00:01:43.560> you're<00:01:43.920> starting<00:01:44.310> from<00:01:44.430> scratch<00:01:44.490> again

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
short you're starting from scratch again

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.889 
short you're starting from scratch again
so<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.110> you've<00:01:46.259> got<00:01:46.290> your<00:01:46.619> measurement<00:01:47.100> mark

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
so now you've got your measurement mark

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.530 
so now you've got your measurement mark
some<00:01:48.899> people<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> tear<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:49.920> because

material<00:01:58.020> that's<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.320> long<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
material that's this long we're just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
material that's this long we're just
going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> use<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.729> scrap<00:02:00.119> piece<00:02:00.390> for

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
going to use this scrap piece for

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
going to use this scrap piece for
demonstration<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.619> then<00:02:02.189> we're<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.340> going

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
demonstration and then we're just going

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
demonstration and then we're just going
to<00:02:02.640> start<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.689> end<00:02:05.689> down<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.899> length

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to start at one end down to the length

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.529 
to start at one end down to the length
to<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> other<00:02:07.320> side<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.479> just

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
to the other side and then you're just

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.229 
to the other side and then you're just
going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> flip<00:02:10.080> over

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
going to flip over

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.179 
going to flip over
and<00:02:13.239> keep<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.599> back<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:13.930> forth<00:02:14.439> until<00:02:14.709> you

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
and keep going back and forth until you

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.270 
and keep going back and forth until you
get<00:02:15.400> your<00:02:15.549> 10<00:02:15.879> layers<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:17.260> usually<00:02:17.920> you'll

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
get your 10 layers now usually you'll

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.670 
get your 10 layers now usually you'll
only<00:02:18.459> get<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.849> few<00:02:19.299> layers<00:02:19.540> out<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.230> each<00:02:20.379> one<00:02:20.409> of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
only get a few layers out of each one of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.209 
only get a few layers out of each one of
these<00:02:20.739> rolls<00:02:21.719> all<00:02:22.719> right<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.469> the<00:02:23.739> important

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
these rolls all right and the important

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.449 
these rolls all right and the important
thing<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.840> mention<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.620> don't

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
thing that I like to mention is don't

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.240 
thing that I like to mention is don't
take<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.879> little<00:02:28.150> scrap<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:29.040> bend<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.129> over

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
take this little scrap and bend it over

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.530 
take this little scrap and bend it over
in<00:02:30.489> there<00:02:30.609> and<00:02:30.790> thinking<00:02:31.060> that's<00:02:31.299> really

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
in there and thinking that's really

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.910 
in there and thinking that's really
doing<00:02:31.810> anything<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:32.349> starts<00:02:32.650> short

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
doing anything and then starts short

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.349 
doing anything and then starts short
that<00:02:33.099> just<00:02:33.310> makes<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:33.609> really<00:02:33.909> too<00:02:34.030> hard<00:02:34.209> to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
that just makes this really too hard to

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.089 
that just makes this really too hard to
work<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:34.719> so<00:02:34.989> whenever<00:02:35.439> you<00:02:35.709> run<00:02:35.889> with<00:02:36.069> a

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
work with so whenever you run with a

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.190 
work with so whenever you run with a
short<00:02:36.430> piece<00:02:36.579> like<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:36.849> just<00:02:37.719> tear<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.079> off

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
short piece like that just tear it off

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.110 
short piece like that just tear it off
