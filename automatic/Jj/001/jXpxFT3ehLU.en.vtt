00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.139
 because remember that this difference of the car the chassis of a motorcycle also 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.879
 we are ourselves and for that reason we have to protect our body from possible 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.029
 injuries 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.039
 in the market we will find all kinds of costumes but we must take into account 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.339
 what are the essential elements to go through the city 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.659
 many injuries and could avoid only protecting our body even if 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.940
 heat you always have to go adequate 20 equipped 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.700
 good biker gloves and a good tight jacket will not save 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.810
 erosions blows and injuries to the spine in case of a fall 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.620
 but the essential element I say thorium is the helmet 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.080
 approved and correctly fastened 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.120
 in the market you can find them of all types 3 of the integral helmet that is the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.080
 that offers greater ouellet protection with which we will get more field of 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 vision and better ideal confidence for city 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.630
 the clothing has a double function 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.230
 protect and be seen as we must show the other users of the route 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.140
 that we are here 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.770
 we will achieve this with bright clear colors and reflective materials and how 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.560
 did not raise the lighting system that always turned on clean as 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 has the traffic code 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.560
 It is so important to see how to see 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.110
 that is why we always try to carry the screens of helmets and motorcycles 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 in very good condition and very clean otherwise to the light we will lose 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 vision with the danger that this can cause 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.430
 once we are equipped you have to check the bike and be sure of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.610
 its good operation for it first of all we will study in the manual of the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.820
 vehicle all the aspects that we can control we demonstrate 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.210
 Braking system damping status lights 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.050
 here everything that our manual tells us and a very important aspect is the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.200
 pressure and the condition of our tires since they are the ones that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.290
 guarantee contact with the asphalt 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.320
 the motorcycle like the little princess car a maintenance 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.540
 If we do it with the regularity indicated we will make sure not to 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.680
 stay in the ditch what always unpleasant and especially very 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.729
 dangerous 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.239
 To be able to circulate with full legality, we are obliged to always carry 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.870
 our driving license 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.409
 The datasheet 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.499
 the registration certificate and the proof of compulsory insurance 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.949
 We will try to familiarize ourselves with the motorbike through little-traveled streets to 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.739
 get used to your driving 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.439
 we must bear in mind that we are not alone on the road and we have to monitor everything 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.290
 what surrounds us 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.480
 so much ahead 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.550
 as samples 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.550
 for that reason if we understand our mirrors well regulated 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.759
 There are many types of driving depending on the type of bike we choose, but 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.959
 Above all you have to take into account some things 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.280
 The most important thing of all is to foresee the movements of the rest of users 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.450
 we will always keep our eyes high 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.889
 and we will use our peripheral vision 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.769
 you have to anticipate vehicles parked in double row oil stains in the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.699
 ground other irregularity is on the asphalt possible improper turns of 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.319
 other drivers and also the vehicles that come from behind to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.479
 can teach you all this we have prepared some tips that will help you 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.899
 in the driving of your motorcycle
