00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 Clear 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.950
 the 10,000 YouTube subscribers as 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.510
 you already know this device already 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.639
 it's broken so this is a video that 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.559
 we are going up after is that the same 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.830
 day we did salom boxing we decided 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.810
 make many videos to think about later 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.310
 if we launch it and in this video it's like 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.949
 a continuation to the configuration 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.500
 initial where I showed you how 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.660
 configure the device but that comes 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.630
 after that when the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.420
 app of the water app if you go 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.150
 to see here the change that is a change 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.430
 good is it is being like the adjustments 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.470
 of the device there you can 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.390
 see layout of applications and 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.730
 basically in this video I'm going to 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.310
 explain what each one of them serves 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.380
 these options and that are each of 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.470
 these options we're going to start 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.920
 with first application layout 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.250
 this is the way I'm going to 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.200
 organize my applications in support 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.930
 the way they are going to look I can 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.900
 put let's see I can put this 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 application to took and the very basic one is 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.659
 I can move it to take out you can 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.689
 perform 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.939
 as you want and the figure also 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.009
 changes you can arrange 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.770
 figure as you want to really look 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.409
 how are you going to see there as you know 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.780
 it looks a little more interesting I go out and 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.570
 already in the water I'm supposed to see them 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.450
 in the way that I just did it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.790
 organize as you can see is instant 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 that looks looks there's no way you're going to see 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.350
 in the water guys superstition of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 understand airplane mode is the same you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.350
 you know what you mean airplane mode 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.940
 when this option is activated what 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 is going to do is that if I understand the way 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.979
 airplane on the iphone automatically goes 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.500
 to turn on the airplane mode in the water not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.810
 that is going to double to little there is here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.430
 it only shows me what I have 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.990
 linked and it gives me the configuration of the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.320
 few that I have linked as you can see 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.530
 a powers of vÃ­ctor to box of 38 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.840
 millimeters of aluminum that is the sport 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.420
 we continue with the notifications and this 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.370
 is the part that I am most happy 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.860
 because I have tried other devices 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.430
 smart and the truth is that the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.440
 notifications I do not like for example 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.870
 in the pp had all the notifications 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.209
 and I did not feel like a lot of freedom in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.440
 where I can how to configure the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.010
 notifications that they really 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.140
 I want to see in it on the device in the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.790
 clock but here if we have this option 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.080
 as you can see activity 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.670
 I can here achievement 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.000
 I want to see this I do not want to see it but 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.820
 they are notifications specifically not 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.610
 for the phone but for support 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.380
 they keep telling you again in the hair 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300
 If I turned off the notification of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.490
 whatsapp so that I do not get in the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.950
 clock also turned off on the phone 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.900
 I did not have that option of only 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.270
 well it can be that now in 92 and it 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.310
 do but before when I buy it not 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.290
 had that option of me being able to configure 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.920
 the unique applications that I want 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.740
 that come out on the device now yes what 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.990
 I have ok that's what this is about 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.520
 part here then there are all the 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.250
 applications I have installed and the 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.200
 can cancel here but they are the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.100
 notifications specifically for the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.040
 support for glances is this is how by 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.860
 example this in how the applications 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.480
 that will be here as an access 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.310
 direct and here now I can configure 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.430
 to be there or not there 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.500
 always open and always active as 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.950
 for example look here now it sounds is the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.230
 what's here 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.450
 the lowest heart rate here where is 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.430
 I can come here and configure it as 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.280
 for example the ms 5 and now I can download 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.280
 I can also instagram or jarc 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.910
 enter trip advisor upload it here to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.489
 create a kind of shortcut that 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.260
 is what is the look I do not know why you 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.330
 they put that very creative name there 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.400
 annoy guys duplicate the options 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.860
 that I have on the device on the iphone 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.599
 here so when I activate the no 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.190
 bother is basically the same as in 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.950
 the airplane mode is still active the no 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.760
 bother and I have it in duplicate is going to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.130
 duplicate the action also in the water in 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.959
 general we are going to have them good the same 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.889
 that we have in the device in the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.510
 iphone but only for water my 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.860
 information the information of 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.410
 device there we can see that it has 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.840
 six gigabytes of capacity with 5.8 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.340
 gigabytes available version 1 and that 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.229
 kind of information there is that is also 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.240
 software update required 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.820
 the same you can see what it is 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.400
 identical to what we have 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.480
 the air with orientation of the clock 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.010
 this is where we can change the 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.780
 orientation to the right to the left 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.160
 to the crown we can put it to the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.550
 right or left as we want 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.740
 Apogee language and then on 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.600
 continue to lose weight and you know 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.970
 brightness and text size here we can 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.220
 change the size and brightness in the 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.580
 device you can download it in the 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.470
 shine in this that is remember in the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.560
 Science nickname of how to lower the brightness 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.540
 Well, it went down a little bit and vibration 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.120
 also the same here I can change 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.210
 the sound alerts it basically the same 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.920
 that we have in the iphone but for the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.210
 water code also health also 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.970
 activity here we are going to have the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.210
 applications that we want to have in the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.100
 device and it's basically how 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.170
 install them and uninstall we put them 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.150
 I can come here to duplicate on the iphone or 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.160
 customized here can you the 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.590
 personalization in the way that I 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.320
 I want that application to work in the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.840
 support on my device if I want what 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.980
 from here and it's going to be the same functions 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.560
 the notification the dictation 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.150
 and that kind of configuration that we have 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.620
 here if as you can see they are 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.630
 many applications is a little 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.910
 difficult to show it to all those who 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.160
 I get the option every application that does not 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.360
 is an application 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.819
 let's say how 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.889
 of default application that brings the 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.530
 device give you these two options 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.150
 show in the water either and so I would 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.759
 here is basically how it is 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.530
 uninstall it because it is not displayed and what 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.349
 from here and there it's like that installed 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.180
 because there it is shown and shown in 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.860
 look you already know what you want 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.330
 say the word of glance but 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.860
 basically here I'm going to have all 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.699
 the applications that are already 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.370
 available for the water that they already have 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.530
 that extension created and here what gives me 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.199
 the options of it leave that extension 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.539
 in the water or take it out for example I 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.610
 I come here and uninstall here 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.129
 you defeated amazon here says 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.080
 uninstalling up here although you see 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.719
 tiny but knowing is installing and if 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.849
 I light it is installing as I had 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.500
 said before they leave the water if they are 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.779
 applications that do not walk that way 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.330
 is that they do not last anything to install themselves and 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:53.669
 uninstall your guys but good ya 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.550
 we see that here we have not been much in 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.970
 the device 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.920
 but we had them on the iphone 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.720
 but there you have the bet now let's 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.180
 see to install an application guys 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.430
 it's the same procedure 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.310
 come here install it and already that 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.270
 application that I'm going to give you here 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.770
 install it once installed 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.980
 applications applications is supposed 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:19.640
 to leave here by default is going to be the 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.220
 extension in the support I am the one that I come 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.710
 here and I decide if I want him to stay or 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.710
 If I want him to leave I want him to leave or 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.570
 do not leave where you are but 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.810
 look at this wonderwall even if I finish it 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:35.300
 to install says show on the support it 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.640
 install like this by default I can come and 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.560
 basically like to remove the extension 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.300
 guys I already think that that's it already with 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.330
 the videos that we have made already you know 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.210
 the most important thing and everything you need 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.800
 know about the support for boys already living in 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.570
 the configurations as you use 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.700
 tell me here below that another video 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.220
 they need to see other videos 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.080
 like to see about this device 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.750
 let's say here they carry the comments that 

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.280
 I do not have this because you saw 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.350
 that we broke them 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.860
