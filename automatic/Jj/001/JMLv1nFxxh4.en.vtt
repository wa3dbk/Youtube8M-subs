00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
hang about you'll focus une for you get

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040 
hang about you'll focus une for you get
a<00:00:40.100> lot<00:00:40.340> more<00:00:40.370> relaxed<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.720> can<00:00:41.870> do<00:00:41.990> it

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
a lot more relaxed of it and can do it

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.200 
a lot more relaxed of it and can do it
pretty<00:00:42.320> much<00:00:42.470> without<00:00:42.620> thinking<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:44.090> then

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
pretty much without thinking and then

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.490 
pretty much without thinking and then
you<00:00:44.330> can<00:00:44.450> start<00:00:44.630> trying<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:44.960> do<00:00:45.080> little<00:00:45.290> tricks

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
you can start trying to do little tricks

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.240 
you can start trying to do little tricks
like<00:00:46.150> body<00:00:47.150> burials<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.870> pivots<00:00:48.290> or<00:00:48.680> follies

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
like body burials and pivots or follies

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.880 
like body burials and pivots or follies
I<00:00:49.670> can't<00:00:50.000> do<00:00:50.150> those<00:00:50.270> yet<00:00:50.510> or<00:00:51.079> putting<00:00:51.740> weight

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
I can't do those yet or putting weight

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.640 
I can't do those yet or putting weight
on<00:00:51.920> your<00:00:52.100> front<00:00:52.160> foot<00:00:52.840> right<00:00:53.840> on<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.110> nose<00:00:54.290> on

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
on your front foot right on the nose on

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.100 
on your front foot right on the nose on
the<00:00:54.739> back<00:00:55.250> balancing<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.329> turn<00:00:56.630> of<00:00:56.810> order

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
the back balancing it turn of order

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.140 
the back balancing it turn of order
angles<00:00:57.500> all<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.489> stuff<00:00:58.760> lots<00:00:59.030> of

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
angles all that stuff lots of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.630 
angles all that stuff lots of
experimentation<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:00.410> pretty<00:01:00.560> fun<00:01:00.829> you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
experimentation so it's pretty fun you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.680 
experimentation so it's pretty fun you
might<00:01:01.790> find<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.090> good<00:01:02.239> idea<00:01:02.420> i<00:01:02.510> haven't

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
might find it's good idea i haven't

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.840 
might find it's good idea i haven't
bothered<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.890> might<00:01:04.100> find<00:01:04.309> your<00:01:04.670> honor

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
bothered but you might find your honor

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.550 
bothered but you might find your honor
you<00:01:05.149> might<00:01:05.329> slip<00:01:05.630> off<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.840> end<00:01:06.170> because<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
you might slip off the end because the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.610 
you might slip off the end because the
ball<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:06.860> slip<00:01:07.510> that<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.170> might<00:01:09.440> find

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
ball can slip that so you might find

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.110 
ball can slip that so you might find
your<00:01:09.800> model<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.070> hammer<00:01:10.220> in<00:01:10.370> summer<00:01:10.760> little

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
your model to hammer in summer little

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.899 
your model to hammer in summer little
wooden<00:01:11.300> blocks<00:01:11.710> I've<00:01:12.710> rendered<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.159> deck<00:01:13.370> and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
wooden blocks I've rendered the deck and

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.030 
wooden blocks I've rendered the deck and
that<00:01:14.060> will<00:01:14.150> just<00:01:14.440> stop<00:01:15.440> you're<00:01:15.590> slipping<00:01:15.920> off

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
that will just stop you're slipping off

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.700 
that will just stop you're slipping off
the<00:01:16.190> edge<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:17.450> you're<00:01:17.930> finding<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.380> getting

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
the edge if you're finding it getting

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.320 
the edge if you're finding it getting
really<00:01:19.010> easy<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.370> can<00:01:19.640> try<00:01:19.850> different<00:01:19.909> things

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
really easy you can try different things

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.050 
really easy you can try different things
i<00:01:20.870> trolled<00:01:21.380> my<00:01:21.530> snow<00:01:21.770> skate<00:01:22.100> here<00:01:22.400> which<00:01:22.940> is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
i trolled my snow skate here which is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.100 
i trolled my snow skate here which is
interesting<00:01:23.540> because<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.720> have<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.960> balance

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
interesting because you have to balance

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.330 
interesting because you have to balance
forward<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.620> backwards<00:01:24.950> there<00:01:25.130> because

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
forward and backwards there because

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.370 
forward and backwards there because
you're<00:01:25.490> only<00:01:25.580> got<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:25.790> little<00:01:26.200> just<00:01:27.200> got<00:01:27.350> a

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
you're only got a little just got a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.289 
you're only got a little just got a
little<00:01:27.440> ski<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.920> balance<00:01:28.340> on<00:01:28.520> instead<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
little ski to balance on instead of the

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.350 
little ski to balance on instead of the
year<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:30.320> whole<00:01:30.470> deck<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:31.790> doesn't<00:01:32.060> really

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
year the whole deck it doesn't really

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.020 
year the whole deck it doesn't really
work<00:01:32.750> with<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.020> snowboard<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:34.549> probably<00:01:34.880> would

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
work with a snowboard it probably would

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.550 
work with a snowboard it probably would
if<00:01:35.180> you've<00:01:35.420> got<00:01:35.600> something<00:01:35.869> bigger<00:01:36.320> than<00:01:36.409> a

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
if you've got something bigger than a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.350 
if you've got something bigger than a
two<00:01:36.710> liter<00:01:36.950> bottle<00:01:36.979> like<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.880> barrel

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
two liter bottle like and the barrel

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.440 
two liter bottle like and the barrel
some<00:01:39.080> of<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.010> give<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:40.940> go<00:01:41.240> if<00:01:41.299> you

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
some of that so give that go if you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.740 
some of that so give that go if you
really<00:01:41.720> want<00:01:41.900> we<00:01:42.080> just<00:01:42.619> go<00:01:42.710> snowboarding<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
really want we just go snowboarding and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.359 
really want we just go snowboarding and
that's<00:01:45.020> pretty<00:01:45.200> much<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:46.010> just<00:01:46.189> saved

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
that's pretty much it you just saved

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.680 
that's pretty much it you just saved
yourself<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:47.080> equid<00:01:48.080> lush
