 so interested in photography 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 also because it is a rather 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.140
 interesting enough to do 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.479
 It's really nice to make a 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 very good activity to learn if 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.510
 that creates results for us so much 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 Satisfactory, too, I hope to achieve 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.330
 spend a lot of things for you still 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.700
 for you to develop enough 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.229
 this photographic part of you so that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.180
 This photo is taken here in Brazil. 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.860
 better and even in the countries of the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 Portuguese also our patricians 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.740
 Angolan Portuguese and has so many 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.329
 other readers do not even know the light for everyone 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860
 Here, but I want to thank everyone. 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.020
 thank you very much 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.650
 well I'm going to launch now too that the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 our next practical class and it will be 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.110
 so put some rules here but 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 the same ones that were previously here 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.579
 but I'm going to ask you to work hard at 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.649
 a little more to try to compose better 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.890
 the image and try mainly 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.250
 decentralize the main focus of the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.600
 photography and really is with 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.759
 elements that have a 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.060
 in the scenario there and tried to make a 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.899
 For that, there you will only be able to post 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.350
 a photo and about 800 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.380
 megahertz basically no theme but to 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.500
 anyone who wants to theme animals or people without 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.920
 pose and also what you can not have in your 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.140

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.140
 no studio type at all 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.600
 can use artificial lighting or 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.330
 so you can even use the flash but off 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.970
 camera and normal flash without being flash 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.400

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.380
