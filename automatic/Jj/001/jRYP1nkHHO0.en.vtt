00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.309
 time to analyze 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.410
 How can you go to the Mexican national team? 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.580
 in this next world carlos 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.550
 hermosillo cameron brazil and croatia 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.220
 in that order a group recorded for a tri 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.589
 that was assembled from November to the front 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.419
 this one of miguel herrera that already has its 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.060
 name your players that is about to 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.940
 start the world cup looking to get what 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.600
 as far as possible 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.890
 It costs me a lot of work because they tell me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.750
 finally that the selection always 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.700
 advances and that is achieved and more now that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 has any number of players in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.560
 europe that was something we wanted all 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 the world but I also have to be very 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.180
 clear and very honest or after seeing 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 the tie how does it get how does it qualify 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 of the whole show that has been armed 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.510
 around that if the mom that if the dad 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.880
 which is equal to the parrot and the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.570
 truth that seems unthinkable 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.590
 today the players are not at 100% 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.590
 I do not see players without 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.390
 in a good football mood 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.890
 mental 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 I think it's going to cost 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 I work in Mexico I repeat again no no 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 I don `t believe 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.350
 I do not believe and I finally say that the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.180
 louse herrera be magician that is me it seems 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.680
 that is a good technician but the process 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.430
 it's very short what is his turn and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.020
 want to implement a game model more 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.120
 well I think he has to work 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 in the psychological part in the part of 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.560
 motivate the players so that for 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.720
 can give a good very good game and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.340
 to move forward but it is something 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.580
 work now for me has a great 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.950
 Mexican advantage that with what we saw in 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.930
 the eliminator we all give it as a 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.300
 team that played very badly left us very 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.430
 bad image then for me worse 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.320
 of the image that he gave us playing the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.660
 repechage in the games of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.900
 eliminatory will not give us then I 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.560
 I hope that they do something and that they will 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.780
 be better than what we have been telling us 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.990
 since the first elimination match 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.550
 I agree but better this and then 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.370
 the next the same and the next the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.620
 another level the tie against 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.040
 nigeria that is has players of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.900
 international level 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.840
 to make a good world cup eyes 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.380
 your best player does not come who watches 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.200
 because I do not say why but fine 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.700
 I insist with something that may sound 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 as a no-brainer but you do not see it 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 so much for the conjuncture that means 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.910
 have the prayer in the group for me 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.950
 Mexico has a final that is the part 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.950
 of the debut against Cameroon if you win 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.690
 that is in the race because it can happen 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.420
 the luxury of losing the second game 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 against brazilian party they would lose 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.410
 surely 29 28 of the 31 selections 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.510
 participants and will arrive with the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.730
 possibility of classifying by winning 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.430
 second final against loses but if 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.470
 loses entry and eliminates can get 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.340
 eliminated the last one that I also return 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.410
 to repeat what I said before always 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.140
 to Mexico, the start-up costs 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.510
 it costs you, I do not remember a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.220
 victory in the first match now what 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.200
 what we needed and I comment right now 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.150
 Carlos at the beginning is that the players 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.739
 which may be different from mexico 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.180
 walk at a very good level and are the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.450
 players who are in europe and for me 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.450
 It was 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.440
 but the others are not in a good 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 moment the pea is not in good 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.720
 moment also saved that will be 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.460
 because we are all convinced less in 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.260
 the analysis of how I can help the 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.470
 Mexican national team here in sports 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.470
