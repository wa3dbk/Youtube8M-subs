00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
felt onto this panel to create these

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.990 
felt onto this panel to create these
pockets<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> pockets<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:08.879> we

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
pockets and in the pockets is where we

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.029 
pockets and in the pockets is where we
can<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> growing<00:02:09.959> when<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.830> done

living wall daniel has a plant right
here<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.590> first<00:02:26.190> he<00:02:26.310> takes<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.960> plant<00:02:27.960> onto

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
here and first he takes the plant onto

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.230 
here and first he takes the plant onto
the<00:02:28.950> little<00:02:29.310> root<00:02:29.460> wrapper<00:02:29.790> here<00:02:29.940> which<00:02:30.090> are

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the little root wrapper here which are

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240 
the little root wrapper here which are
felt<00:02:30.450> squares<00:02:30.840> made<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> same<00:02:31.740> felt

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
felt squares made out of the same felt

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.730 
felt squares made out of the same felt
and<00:02:32.460> then<00:02:32.730> he<00:02:33.150> will<00:02:33.570> fold<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> bottom<00:02:34.500> piece

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
and then he will fold the bottom piece

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.640 
and then he will fold the bottom piece
up<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.940> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.240> push<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.480> down<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.170> this

up and kind of push it down and this

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.610 
up and kind of push it down and this
makes<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:38.010> little<00:02:38.570> satchel<00:02:39.570> for<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.110> plant<00:02:40.410> to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
makes a little satchel for the plant to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.010 
makes a little satchel for the plant to
grow<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.250> then<00:02:41.850> he<00:02:41.970> folds<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> sides<00:02:42.720> over

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
grow in and then he folds the sides over

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.620 
grow in and then he folds the sides over
and<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:43.980> he<00:02:44.100> has<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> nice<00:02:44.550> root<00:02:45.360> wrapped

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
and then he has a nice root wrapped

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.040 
and then he has a nice root wrapped
plant<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.730> neat<00:02:48.120> thing<00:02:48.150> about<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.720> felt

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
plant and the neat thing about this felt

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.070 
plant and the neat thing about this felt
is<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> wicks<00:02:49.740> water

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
is it wicks water

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.700 
is it wicks water
he<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.290> inserts<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.830> into<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> pockets<00:02:53.550> and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
he just inserts it into the pockets and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.770 
he just inserts it into the pockets and
the<00:02:55.710> roots<00:02:55.950> will<00:02:56.190> grow<00:02:56.340> back<00:02:56.880> into<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.480> back

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the roots will grow back into the back

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.140 
the roots will grow back into the back
layer<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.230> felt<00:02:58.470> where<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> water

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
layer of felt where they get the water

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.080 
layer of felt where they get the water
and<00:03:00.390> nutrients<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.960> they<00:03:01.140> need<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
and nutrients that they need so what a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.760 
and nutrients that they need so what a
plant<00:03:03.390> get<00:03:03.600> root<00:03:03.840> ground<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.410> setting<00:03:04.740> like

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
plant get root ground in a setting like

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.820 
plant get root ground in a setting like
this<00:03:05.130> well<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> unique<00:03:06.480> thing<00:03:06.750> about<00:03:07.560> growing

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
this well the unique thing about growing

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.480 
this well the unique thing about growing
in<00:03:08.100> felt

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
in felt

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.120 
in felt
is<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.390> reaches<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> hydroponic<00:03:10.830> state

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
is that it reaches a hydroponic state

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.400 
is that it reaches a hydroponic state
where<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.030> roots<00:03:12.240> change<00:03:12.630> their<00:03:12.810> habit<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
where the roots change their habit and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.400 
where the roots change their habit and
they<00:03:14.250> grow<00:03:14.850> no<00:03:15.090> longer<00:03:15.570> than<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.990> point<00:03:16.230> where

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
they grow no longer than the point where

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.260 
they grow no longer than the point where
they<00:03:16.530> need<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.010> nutrients<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.850> water<00:03:17.970> that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
they need the nutrients and water that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.380 
they need the nutrients and water that
they<00:03:18.420> require<00:03:19.380> here's<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.310> vine<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:21.060> been

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
they require here's a vine that's been

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.720 
they require here's a vine that's been
grown<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:22.020> quite<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> while<00:03:22.500> there<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.610> you

grown in for quite a while there so you

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.240 
grown in for quite a while there so you
can<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.120> how<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.390> roots<00:03:24.690> begin<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.230> grow<00:03:25.470> you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
can see how the roots begin to grow you

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520 
can see how the roots begin to grow you
still<00:03:26.490> have<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> ability<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.210> remove<00:03:28.200> the
