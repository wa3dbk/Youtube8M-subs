00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
what happened in windows 3.0 all the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.230

sudden the third version went through

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
sudden the third version went through
the<00:02:06.329> roof<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.659> became<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> operating<00:02:07.439> system

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
