00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.900
 all sharing the same hostility towards the bmw x3 audi q5 and 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.939
 mercedes slk arrive at the same time on the market 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.070
 in this category suddenly expanded 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 they vie for the leading roles but their arguments are opposed 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.279
 to start with their style 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.710
 nothing provoc 'the glk plays hard with massive cine and abrupt to the point of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.089
 claim an affiliation with the rustic asia 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.989
 more consensual and especially less proud that it can be the q5 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.820
 brings closer to a raised station wagon an easier silhouette to put on and 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.590
 well misleading because with his four games 63 on the other the q5 area of ​​10 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.589
 centimeters his rival to the star 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 inside of our two protagonists only grow their 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.910
 difference it does not laugh aboard the glk whose dashboard is at 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.260
 the image of his body 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.840
 the big steering wheel and the almost vertical windshield suggests a spirit 4 4 ok the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.640
 well 5 he does not really adhere 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 on board one feels more in a sedan his driving position - 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.670
 right his dashboard turned towards the driver and that's life 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.590
 offering better support to the pilot 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 his dashboard also shine by his standing but he shows himself more 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.840
 warm with its soft shapes and it's a little clearer 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the habitability chapter and the gel that made very good impression but according to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.760
 our measurements the rear seats of his rival between more spacing at the elbow 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.850
 like knee 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.409
 we will also remember the higher modularity of the audit and its safe 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.409
 larger than 100 liters than that of mayor cedex 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.830
 5 once launched our savior confirm their road penchant in 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.540
 unveiling a surprisingly strong balance on their supports with 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.670
 work biting 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.200
 and respect and friendship 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.899
 it complements very well their center of gravity high perched accordons 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.750
 however for more worried ease and greater dynamism 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.340
 gpk to kribi slightly wider cash movements and his direction 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.060
 and more multiplies 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.790
 however, in terms of comfort, the Mercedes has clearly the advantage 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.350
 on his opponent despite his upholstery a little more firm the road and more 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.690
 often plata boundless 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.690
 these suspensions filter in the middle the small irregularities 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.719
 equipped with large diesel v6 served by a seven-speed automatic transmission 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.559
 is great in fact an amenity of water bowl 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:24.859
 the 3-liter mercedes soon after its availability and consistency of 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.229
 his climbs 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.749
 slightly at once more the tdi block pushes very hard also clusters 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.219
 even higher in the towers 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.639
 according to the modes the box dsg passed reports between 4210 4800 revolutions 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.510
 for the scene I have too scattered the easy-going bald to cross the 4000 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:41.399
 rpm 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.269
 the audi transmission and the sixteen additional horses of the q5 him 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.129
 allows to win in pure performance the 0 to 100 kilometers-hour but him 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.769
 claiming that six seconds 5 is a full second less than the glk at 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.700
 final this set engine-box seduced us more 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.769
 for its dynamism but also for its sobriety 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.900
 the k4 of a left your head to be satisfied with this letter him 200 km in 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.819
 average on fast track against 8 liters 2 for his rival stuttgart 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.450
 dominated in many areas by the well 5 the glk remains no less 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.939
 one of the best representatives of the category 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.810
 more polished but also more successful the little brother for seven years carries 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.709
 nevertheless quite clearly 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.329
 its price ends to convince me because if the correspondent to the euro near to 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.139
 that of glk without malus will be limited to 750 euros which is more final 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.699
 gentleman 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.429
 good
