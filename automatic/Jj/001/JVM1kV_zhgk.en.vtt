00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.780 

now<00:03:52.260> doesn't<00:03:52.650> matter<00:03:52.770> you're<00:03:53.070> picking<00:03:53.460> as

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
now doesn't matter you're picking as

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.340 
now doesn't matter you're picking as
long<00:03:54.000> as<00:03:54.180> you're<00:03:54.390> playing<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.780> notes<00:03:54.990> that's

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
long as you're playing the notes that's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.680 
long as you're playing the notes that's
all<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.650> matters<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:55.950> now<00:03:56.390> all<00:03:57.390> right<00:03:57.570> now

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
all that matters right now all right now

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.480 
all that matters right now all right now
the<00:03:57.750> second<00:03:58.140> exercise<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.800> basically<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
the second exercise is basically the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.280 
the second exercise is basically the
same<00:03:59.730> as<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.030> first<00:04:00.210> exercise<00:04:00.540> but<00:04:01.020> it's<00:04:01.140> a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
same as the first exercise but it's a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.890 
same as the first exercise but it's a
bigger<00:04:01.860> stretch<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:03.090> stretch<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.660> from

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
bigger stretch the stretch is going from

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.710 
bigger stretch the stretch is going from
12<00:04:04.380> 15<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.280> 19<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.210> this<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.390> what<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.630> sounds

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
12 15 to 19 so this is what it sounds

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.870 
12 15 to 19 so this is what it sounds
like
