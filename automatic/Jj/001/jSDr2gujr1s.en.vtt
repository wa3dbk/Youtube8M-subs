00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
making a new tactic to map I think all

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850 
making a new tactic to map I think all
teams<00:00:54.300> should<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> standard<00:00:55.170> tactic<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
teams should have a standard tactic that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.770 
teams should have a standard tactic that
they're<00:00:56.039> working<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.550> from<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.600> should

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
they're working out from and that should

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.580 
they're working out from and that should
be<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:59.280> easy<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.570> read<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.020> enemies<00:01:01.440> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
be very like easy to read for enemies so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.869 
be very like easy to read for enemies so
they<00:01:01.620> always<00:01:01.920> thinks<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.309> doing<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> same

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
they always thinks you're doing the same

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
they always thinks you're doing the same
thing<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:04.019> you've<00:01:04.140> done<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.650> can

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
thing then when you've done it you can

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.490 
thing then when you've done it you can
start<00:01:04.949> faking<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.299> an<00:01:06.689> example<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
start faking on it for an example for a

dies<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> your<00:01:53.220> play<00:01:53.399> dice

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
dies or if one of your play dice

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
dies or if one of your play dice
detectives<00:01:54.390> will<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.780> messed<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.100> then

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
detectives will be messed up so you then

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.550 
detectives will be messed up so you then
need<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> plan<00:01:57.090> B<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.659> even<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> plan<00:01:58.229> C

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
need to have a plan B or even a plan C

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.980 
need to have a plan B or even a plan C
so<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.219> example<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.939> guys<00:02:00.119> die<00:02:00.450> you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so for example one of you guys die you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
so for example one of you guys die you
won't<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.530> enough<00:02:01.770> flash<00:02:02.009> bangs<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.640> flash<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
won't have enough flash bangs to flash a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.490 
won't have enough flash bangs to flash a
bomb<00:02:03.270> site<00:02:03.509> an<00:02:03.719> enemy<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> good

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
bomb site an enemy can have a good

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.050 
bomb site an enemy can have a good
position<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> take<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.850> team

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
position on you and take down your team

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.210 
position on you and take down your team
so<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> need<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.930> rethink<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.009> then

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
so you need to rethink what to do then

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
so you need to rethink what to do then
maybe<00:02:08.489> go<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.819> towards<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.390> go<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:09.899> middle

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
maybe go back towards be go out middle

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.400 
maybe go back towards be go out middle
but<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.879> get<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> kill<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.360> enemy<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.260> whole

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but if you get a kill on enemy the whole

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.700 
but if you get a kill on enemy the whole
map

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
map

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.400 
map
opens<00:02:14.100> up<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.820> need<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.360> rotate<00:02:15.510> let

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
opens up they need to rotate let

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.680 
opens up they need to rotate let
somebody<00:02:16.650> off<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.760> take<00:02:17.880> middle<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
somebody off be to take middle the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.360 
somebody off be to take middle the
middle<00:02:18.720> guy<00:02:19.140> need<00:02:19.410> need<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.830> go<00:02:19.920> back<00:02:20.160> towards

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
middle guy need need to go back towards

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.850 
middle guy need need to go back towards
a<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> open<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.320> lot<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
a so it's going to open up a lot of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.520 
a so it's going to open up a lot of
opportunities<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> middle<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.510> B<00:02:24.780> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
opportunities to the middle to the B to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380 
opportunities to the middle to the B to
still<00:02:25.740> go<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> towards<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.000> people<00:02:27.240> so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
still go a towards a lot of people so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.170 
still go a towards a lot of people so
always<00:02:27.660> read<00:02:28.380> rethink<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.580> happens<00:02:29.970> if

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
always read rethink what happens if

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.380 
always read rethink what happens if
enemy<00:02:30.570> dies<00:02:30.950> how<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.010> practice<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.970> that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
enemy dies how you practice this is that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.960 
enemy dies how you practice this is that
you<00:02:33.480> go<00:02:33.600> into<00:02:33.930> an<00:02:34.020> empty<00:02:34.500> server<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.850> in

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
you go into an empty server you go in

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.900 
you go into an empty server you go in
there<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.650> practice<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> flashes<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
there you practice the flashes so the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.970 
there you practice the flashes so the
whole<00:02:39.060> site<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.720> flash<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.530> goes<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.920> all

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
whole site is flash this goes for all

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.120 
whole site is flash this goes for all
maps<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.640> all<00:02:41.730> tactics<00:02:42.210> obviously<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.130> you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
maps and all tactics obviously and you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.520 
maps and all tactics obviously and you
you<00:02:44.550> train<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.150> hours<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.990> flashes

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you train it for hours all that flashes

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.560 
you train it for hours all that flashes
has<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.890> perfect<00:02:47.430> that's<00:02:47.910> what<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.240> did<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
has to be perfect that's what we did a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.190 
has to be perfect that's what we did a
lot<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.200> helps<00:02:49.500> our<00:02:49.710> game<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.490> much<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
lot and it helps our game so much and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.270 
lot and it helps our game so much and
when<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.290> practice<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.770> for<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> few<00:02:53.220> hours

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
when you practice it for a few hours

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.150 
when you practice it for a few hours
before<00:02:53.580> practice<00:02:54.300> games<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:55.620> go<00:02:55.770> out<00:02:55.890> you

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
before practice games you go out you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.070 
before practice games you go out you
practice<00:02:56.670> versus<00:02:57.000> other<00:02:57.150> teams<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.990> how

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
practice versus other teams you see how

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.380 
practice versus other teams you see how
it<00:02:58.200> goes<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.790> when<00:02:59.790> you're<00:02:59.880> done<00:03:00.000> practicing

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
for tonight you go into the server again

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.570 
for tonight you go into the server again
an<00:03:03.030> empty<00:03:03.780> server<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.380> only<00:03:04.530> your<00:03:04.740> team<00:03:05.010> you
