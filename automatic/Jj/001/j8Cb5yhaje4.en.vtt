demonstration had MIDI controller with
the<00:00:19.769> digitech<00:00:20.369> whammy<00:00:21.020> right<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.200> haven't

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the digitech whammy right now I haven't

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
the digitech whammy right now I haven't
set<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.520> MIDI<00:00:23.699> controller<00:00:24.030> here

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
set up this is the MIDI controller here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.710 
set up this is the MIDI controller here
going<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.170> MIDI<00:00:25.380> input<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> Whammy

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
going is the MIDI input at the Whammy

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.240 
going is the MIDI input at the Whammy
among<00:00:27.720> continuous<00:00:28.199> controller<00:00:28.500> 11<00:00:28.949> oh<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.190> you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
among continuous controller 11 oh if you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.910 
among continuous controller 11 oh if you
can<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> panel<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.680> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
can see that on the panel that on the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.549 
can see that on the panel that on the
whammy<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.640> controls<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.270> pitch<00:00:33.559> goes

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
whammy is what controls the pitch goes

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.489 
whammy is what controls the pitch goes
from<00:00:34.739> 0<00:00:34.949> to<00:00:35.010> 127<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.929> on<00:00:36.929> these<00:00:37.109> octave

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
from 0 to 127 and on these octave

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.979 
from 0 to 127 and on these octave
settings<00:00:37.890> 0<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.339> be<00:00:38.519> the<00:00:39.239> normal<00:00:39.600> signal

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
settings 0 would be the normal signal

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.319 
settings 0 would be the normal signal
and<00:00:40.140> then<00:00:40.429> 127<00:00:41.429> would<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.729> fully<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.179> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and then 127 would be the fully up the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.069 
and then 127 would be the fully up the
octave<00:00:42.589> so<00:00:43.589> I'll<00:00:44.550> show<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.879> how<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.089> map<00:00:45.839> right

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
octave so I'll show you how to map right

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.549 
octave so I'll show you how to map right
now<00:00:47.149> up<00:00:48.149> octave<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.690> down<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> normal<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
now up octave is down and the normal is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:59.099 
now up octave is down and the normal is
up<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.069> switch<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> around

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.840 

and<00:00:59.620> this<00:00:59.739> is<00:00:59.859> the<00:00:59.949> continuous<00:01:00.429> votes<00:01:00.640> it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
and this is the continuous votes it's

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:10.250 
and this is the continuous votes it's
gonna<00:01:00.969> be<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:03.460> those<00:01:03.579> in-between

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:25.860 

and<00:01:11.260> especially<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:25.180> switch<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.390> around<00:01:25.690> if

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
and especially then switch it around if

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:38.180 
and especially then switch it around if
I<00:01:25.930> press<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.290> invert<00:01:26.530> button<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:37.540> is

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
I press the invert button this is

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.130 
I press the invert button this is
trigger<00:01:39.190> mode<00:01:39.460> 1<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.280> trigger<00:01:42.520> modes

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
trigger mode 1 and in the trigger modes

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.920 
trigger mode 1 and in the trigger modes
you<00:01:44.140> can<00:01:44.320> trigger<00:01:45.220> buzzer<00:01:45.490> either<00:01:45.700> off<00:01:46.060> one<00:01:46.899> or

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
you can trigger buzzer either off one or

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.460 
you can trigger buzzer either off one or
two<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.880> trigger<00:01:49.149> mode<00:01:49.360> one<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:50.200> set<00:01:50.440> a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
two and in trigger mode one you set a

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.350 
two and in trigger mode one you set a
threshold<00:01:50.800> point<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.610> right<00:01:52.030> now<00:01:52.180> my

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
threshold point and right now my

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:04.410 
threshold point and right now my
threshold<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.840> think<00:01:53.020> is<00:02:02.850> from<00:02:03.850> one<00:02:04.060> value<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
threshold I think is from one value to

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:28.550 
threshold I think is from one value to
another<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:05.110> trigger<00:02:05.649> mode

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.040 

mm-hmm<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.970> trigger<00:02:30.209> mode<00:02:30.360> 1<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.810> trigger

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
mm-hmm it's trigger mode 1 and trigger

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.790 
mm-hmm it's trigger mode 1 and trigger
mode<00:02:31.200> 2<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.800> caught<00:02:32.430> by<00:02:32.459> contrast<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:34.050> cross

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
mode 2 and caught by contrast you cross

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.390 
mode 2 and caught by contrast you cross
that<00:02:34.980> threshold<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:37.370> go<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that threshold and it's going to go to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.740 
that threshold and it's going to go to
that<00:02:38.580> value<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.090> long<00:02:39.240> as<00:02:39.390> you're<00:02:39.480> over<00:02:39.569> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
that value as long as you're over the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.210 
that value as long as you're over the
threshold<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.290> then<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.890> across<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
threshold and then the across the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.650 
threshold and then the across the
threshold<00:02:41.459> again<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.940> goes<00:02:42.030> back<00:02:42.090> down<00:02:42.420> some

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
threshold again it goes back down some

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.660 
threshold again it goes back down some
of<00:02:42.720> us<00:02:42.870> report<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.040> an<00:02:44.100> example<00:02:44.340> of

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
of us report so this is an example of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.120 
of us report so this is an example of
using<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> same<00:02:46.170> trigger<00:02:46.470> mode<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.890> or

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
using the same trigger mode to or

00:02:47.130 --> 00:03:14.819 
using the same trigger mode to or
attitudes

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.880 

yeah<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.120> an<00:03:17.239> example<00:03:17.569> using<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.290> MIDI

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
yeah this is an example using the MIDI

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.449 
yeah this is an example using the MIDI
exp<00:03:19.489> in<00:03:19.700> exp<00:03:20.360> mode<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:21.349> don't<00:03:22.099> have<00:03:22.189> a<00:03:22.220> delay

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
exp in exp mode I don't have a delay

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.000 
exp in exp mode I don't have a delay
pedal<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:23.269> has<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> MIDI<00:03:24.049> input<00:03:24.409> so<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:24.829> using

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
pedal that has a MIDI input so I'm using

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.380 
pedal that has a MIDI input so I'm using
my<00:03:26.000> old<00:03:26.180> six<00:03:27.109> code<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.159> next<00:03:28.970> week<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.239> an

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
my old six code but the next week as an

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.569 
my old six code but the next week as an
expression<00:03:29.689> pedal<00:03:30.049> output<00:03:30.620> which<00:03:31.459> is

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
expression pedal output which is

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.069 
expression pedal output which is
connected<00:03:32.030> via<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:33.079> purple<00:03:33.500> cable<00:03:34.269> up<00:03:35.269> into

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
connected via this purple cable up into

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.130 
connected via this purple cable up into
the<00:03:36.609> into<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.790> line<00:03:37.939> six<00:03:38.269> expression<00:03:38.930> pedal

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
the into the line six expression pedal

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.849 
the into the line six expression pedal
input<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:41.019> with<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.200> expression<00:03:42.620> pedal<00:03:42.799> you

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
input and with that expression pedal you

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.819 
input and with that expression pedal you
can<00:03:42.920> set<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.370> two<00:03:44.269> modes<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.379> same<00:03:45.590> delay

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
can set up two modes of the same delay

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.190 
can set up two modes of the same delay
sound<00:03:46.129> so<00:03:46.909> that<00:03:46.970> one<00:03:47.180> set<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.599> be<00:03:47.690> completely

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
sound so that one set to be completely

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.149 
sound so that one set to be completely
dry<00:03:48.769> mix<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:51.409> I<00:03:51.440> have<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.799> other<00:03:51.920> mode

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
dry mix and then I have the other mode

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.479 
dry mix and then I have the other mode
set<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.700> be<00:03:52.849> a<00:03:53.230> fully<00:03:54.230> wet<00:03:54.889> mix<00:03:55.159> with<00:03:55.340> high

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
set to be a fully wet mix with high
