00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.750
 Welcome to the resource center of the 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.150
 of corn presented by the foundation of 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.400
 the angiogenesis this animation will explain 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.559
 how mayu gives me cause the loss 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.930
 Vision Macular Degeneration 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.550
 associated with age dmae is a 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.460
 disease that causes progressive damage 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.490
 from the macula a specialized region of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.109
 the retina the retina is a layer formed 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.330
 by multiple sheets of cells 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.270
 nervous located in the part 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.420
 posterior of the eye the macula contains the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.070
 densest population of nerve cells 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.440
 called photoreceptors and it's 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.780
 particularly important to see 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.910
 details and keep the central part of 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 the vision the central vision is 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.380
 important for activities 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.379
 ordinary daily such as reading 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.290
 drive dial a phone number or 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.789
 recognize faces the macula is composed 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.430
 by several layers of cells 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.590
 specialized the photoreceptors are 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.390
 they sit on top of the layer 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 of cells called pigmentary epithelium 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.170
 retinal and pr 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 under these layers there is a thin sheet 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.060
 called witch's membrane under the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 Bruce's membrane is the choroid a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 system of blood vessels that provide 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.600
 oxygen and nutrients to the macula 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.149
 while the eye ages the waste 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.250
 of the lpr and the surrounding tissues 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.440
 accumulate above and inside the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.020
 witch's membrane ' waste forms 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.450
 deposits called trusas the presence 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 of witches is normally the first sign 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 of the adelma is dry early 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.330
 accumulation of drusen can cause 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.330
 inflammation inflammatory cells 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.000
 they are later recruited by the retina and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.710
 along with the ppr they lived factors of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.659
 growth that cause the vessels 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.759
 blood proliferate the factor of 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.380
 primary growth released is called 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.580
 vascular growth factor 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.740
 endothelial vf the protein vg efe it 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.330
 diffuses in the choroid stimulating the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.869
 proliferation of new blood vessels 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.210
 this process is called angiogenesis the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.130
 new blood vessels emerge and grow 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.679
 within and through the weakened 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 witch's membrane 'at this point the 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.310
 disease progresses from the drier 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.560
 to one more form 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.630
 of the disease called wet mesh 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.060
 these growing blood vessels 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.920
 are abnormally permeable what 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 allows fluids and blood 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.180
 penetrate and leak into the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 layers of the macula fluid accumulates 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.410
 between the bruce membrane and the layer of 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.440
 photoreceptors damaging the delicate 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.390
 nerves needed for vision if you 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.130
 leaves the bleeding untreated due to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.470
 This condition can cause 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.050
 Scarring of the macula and loss 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.540
 permanent vision in the photos 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.000
 shown here the first represents a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.790
 normal vision while the second 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.769
 shows the defects of the maseda the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.140
 most severe form of the mayum age 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.690
 causes the loss of central vision and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.599
 can make the realization of 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.420
 daily tasks like reading driving or 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.670
 recognize faces know what you can do 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.739
 you to detect this important 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.790
 health problem and thus preserve its 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 precious vision
