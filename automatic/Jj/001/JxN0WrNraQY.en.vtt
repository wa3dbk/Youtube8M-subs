just wonder a thorough freestyle you

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.319 
just wonder a thorough freestyle you
know<00:00:43.809> I<00:00:44.050> want<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.739> prove<00:00:44.920> our<00:00:45.190> Malabo<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.030> our

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
know I want to prove our Malabo and our

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.840 
know I want to prove our Malabo and our
CPU<00:00:46.780> is<00:00:46.930> in<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.140> past<00:00:47.410> you<00:00:47.920> know<00:00:47.980> because<00:00:48.730> it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
CPU is in the past you know because it

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.700 
CPU is in the past you know because it
you<00:00:48.940> need<00:00:49.149> our<00:00:49.270> luck<00:00:49.690> right<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.020> malapa<00:00:50.290> to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
you need our luck right the malapa to

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.950 
you need our luck right the malapa to
prove<00:00:50.980> ownership<00:00:51.130> your<00:00:51.550> performance<00:00:52.120> you

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
prove ownership your performance you

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.959 
prove ownership your performance you
know<00:00:53.079> sir<00:00:53.410> you<00:00:53.770> know<00:00:53.890> on<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.430> prep<00:00:54.730> on<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
know sir you know on this prep on the

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.869 
know sir you know on this prep on the
CPU<00:00:55.719> is<00:00:55.809> very<00:00:56.200> important<00:00:56.770> like<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.399> voltage

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
CPU is very important like the voltage

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.850 
CPU is very important like the voltage
you<00:00:58.120> know<00:00:58.329> I<00:00:58.510> know<00:00:58.660> some<00:00:59.020> comparator<00:00:59.559> level

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
you know I know some comparator level

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.430 
you know I know some comparator level
have<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.280> somebody's<00:01:00.850> problem<00:01:01.329> but<00:01:02.020> I<00:01:02.170> will

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
have a somebody's problem but I will

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.070 
have a somebody's problem but I will
multiple<00:01:02.950> our<00:01:03.160> engineer<00:01:03.700> a<00:01:03.730> fix<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.270> let's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
multiple our engineer a fix it let's

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.520 
multiple our engineer a fix it let's
square<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.740> want<00:01:06.009> to<00:01:06.100> prove<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.840> Prasad<00:01:07.840> today<00:01:08.050> I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
square I want to prove it Prasad today I

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.480 
square I want to prove it Prasad today I
to<00:01:08.950> it

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
to it

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.460 
to it
I<00:01:09.520> take<00:01:10.330> all<00:01:10.630> freestyle<00:01:12.720> actually<00:01:13.720> did<00:01:14.350> you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
I take all freestyle actually did you

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.290 
I take all freestyle actually did you
add<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.649> strategy<00:01:15.369> before<00:01:15.580> coming<00:01:16.000> here<00:01:16.119> like

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
add a strategy before coming here like

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.149 
add a strategy before coming here like
you<00:01:16.450> won't<00:01:16.630> start<00:01:16.869> with<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.500> benchmark<00:01:17.799> and

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
you won't start with this benchmark and

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.770 
you won't start with this benchmark and
then<00:01:18.250> this<00:01:18.400> benchmark<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.970> then<00:01:19.060> go<00:01:19.180> for<00:01:19.450> all

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
then this benchmark and then go for all

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.359 
then this benchmark and then go for all
the<00:01:19.930> way<00:01:20.020> for<00:01:20.229> this<00:01:20.320> one<00:01:20.500> what<00:01:20.979> was<00:01:21.189> your

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
the way for this one what was your

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.830 
the way for this one what was your
strategy<00:01:21.490> for<00:01:21.790> this<00:01:22.180> event<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:24.119> don't<00:01:25.119> have<00:01:25.600> any

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
strategy for this event I don't have any

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.149 
strategy for this event I don't have any
friend<00:01:26.140> for<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:26.950> one<00:01:27.310> no<00:01:28.619> yeah<00:01:29.619> I<00:01:29.650> just<00:01:29.890> can't

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
friend for this one no yeah I just can't

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.149 
friend for this one no yeah I just can't
just<00:01:30.490> cracking<00:01:31.200> yeah<00:01:32.200> just<00:01:32.650> for<00:01:33.549> fun<00:01:34.290> yeah<00:01:35.290> I

good<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.030> think<00:02:07.210> about<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.570> even

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
good what do you think about the even

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.960 
good what do you think about the even
about<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.350> its<00:02:08.560> cash<00:02:08.860> price<00:02:09.190> not<00:02:09.459> error<00:02:09.670> you

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
about that its cash price not error you

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.569 
about that its cash price not error you
