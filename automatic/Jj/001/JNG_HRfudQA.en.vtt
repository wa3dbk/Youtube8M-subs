00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.140
 It's okay, I'm going to talk about this today. 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.410
 a matter that many people who buy the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.340
 ps4 is often american 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.910
 or from other countries where the sticker 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.140
 below tells the device to 110 or 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.609
 220 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.230
 many people have doubts if they really 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.449
 that voltage or celebrate come back and such is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 this is a problem that even 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.399
 there were 3 happened too the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.890
 playstation 3 american because it comes 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.160
 written down that 110 and a lot of people 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.760
 what matters is that you live in a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.350
 the voltage only 220 and is afraid of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.079
 turn on the playstation I heard that he 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.260
 Come back but you do not have the courage to stay then. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.690
 We are going to go and see this today. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 Mystery if really playstation 3 or 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 4 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:03.239
 they are volts or not by the case they are 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.229
 3314 that was purchased in Brazil but he 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.380
 is imported from the american united states 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 underneath it he can not get it 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:19.860
 but it is inscribed that it is 110 volts well 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 here you can not see in the video but 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 finally enrolled 110 volts 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.689
 But that's not the way it happens. 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:46.159
 show you here is connected to the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:49.950
 directly connecting the playstation and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.130
 that he himself is 110 calling 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.479
 usually do not live in Goiás in 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.399
 goiás all the apparatuses are the 220 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.700
 outlets are all 220 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.229
 if it were really only 110 he would have 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.800
 Roasted right now 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:14.410
 as you can see working normal 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:18.300
 as if it were normal because it is 220 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:25.810
 fact it is 220 and 110 is not 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.670
 it is not only 110 or 220 volts 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.690
 as well as all sony equipment 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.650
 to sony 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.110
 she is very smart and does not usually 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.750
 do not make a voltage equipment 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.790
 it would only be stupid because they 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.160
 would have to do three types of source one 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.290
 source of the g20 a source of 110 and another 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.810
 bivolt source which has part of the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.840
 world where the vote two others 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.640
 different in participating is only one 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.350
 then it would be up to 100 1 without logic to do 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.150
 three different sources and could not 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:09.250
 only one and back we have questions 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.140
 if the playstation 3 the playstation 4 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.290
 American is coming back or not there 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.650
 notified that all 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.360
 playstation 3 or 4 is bivolt 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.680
 so if you have doubt it has a weight of 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.390
 13 or 14 below 221 only 110 can 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.980
 stay calmly connect that 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.450
 will work on any thousand 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.120
 volts 224 has always had only one myth that is 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.980
 used is often because it does not have 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.200
 sense to put a sticker saying that it is 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.700
 bivolt in a place that only this idea of the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.489
 that only 120 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.959
 in the case of the United States and many 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.270
 times to stores here in Brazil use 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.900
 doing this wrong because 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.810
 hence they pick up the American playstation 4 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.489
 that down there and saying that at 110 and 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.739
 can render the game more 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.340
 transformer and if necessary 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.769
 but it is not 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.750
 now if you prefer to use the 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.530
 stabilizer in case of fear of falling 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.840
 power or even to protect 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.750
 some way 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.239
 there to what extent is it valid but how 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.570
 for fear of burning if disconnected from 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.000
 of the emtu does not exist but instead of 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.130
 buy a stabilizer that is very 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.050
 more expensive with such a business 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.479
 cleaning of the areas and with 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.910
 Prudence does my service 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.310
 protection was not at this table. 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.530
 my protection service fell on this one 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:46.160
 energy and burning it from the 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:49.440
 business I ran away and I did not play yes there 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.400
 This story is denied that 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.130
 Playstation 4 flight and turn 410 or 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.650
 20 alone once again stressed that 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.419
 are all volts independent of what 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.430
 it is written on the screen are all drawing 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.229
 of you playstation 3 was the same case 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.860
 I had one too that said it was 110 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.430
 worked normally did not say galley 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.430
 See you
