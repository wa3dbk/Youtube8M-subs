for a drive in a car what are my choices

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.610 
for a drive in a car what are my choices
how<00:00:30.770> well<00:00:30.950> then<00:00:31.189> -<00:00:31.759> basically<00:00:32.300> all<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.350> take<00:00:33.590> a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
how well then - basically all you take a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.229 
how well then - basically all you take a
motorized<00:00:34.070> carriage<00:00:34.340> like<00:00:34.579> this<00:00:34.850> one<00:00:35.030> here

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
motorized carriage like this one here

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.229 
motorized carriage like this one here
from<00:00:35.570> diamond<00:00:36.290> but<00:00:36.710> be<00:00:36.950> quite<00:00:37.610> hard<00:00:37.969> on<00:00:38.120> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
from diamond but be quite hard on the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.389 
from diamond but be quite hard on the
cobblestone<00:00:38.840> I<00:00:38.989> think<00:00:39.320> oh<00:00:39.500> yeah<00:00:40.010> oh<00:00:40.129> that

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
cobblestone I think oh yeah oh that

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.069 
cobblestone I think oh yeah oh that
would<00:00:40.550> be<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.730> other<00:00:40.969> choice<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:41.300> know<00:00:41.629> the

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
would be the other choice you know the

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.460 
would be the other choice you know the
one<00:00:42.230> on<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.560> rotating<00:00:43.520> platform<00:00:44.210> yeah<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:45.079> I

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
one on the rotating platform yeah so I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.170 
one on the rotating platform yeah so I
think<00:00:45.860> that<00:00:46.670> would<00:00:46.820> be<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.960> choice<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.710> know

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
think that would be the choice you know

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180 
think that would be the choice you know

Germany<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.970> world's<00:02:20.330> first<00:02:20.660> motorized

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
Germany the world's first motorized

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.830 
Germany the world's first motorized
vehicle<00:02:21.920> was<00:02:22.070> built<00:02:22.250> now<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.240> bet<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.690> thought

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
vehicle was built now I bet you thought

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.330 
vehicle was built now I bet you thought
I'd<00:02:24.050> say<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.410> was<00:02:24.470> going<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.740> be<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> four-wheel

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
I'd say it was going to be a four-wheel

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.900 
I'd say it was going to be a four-wheel
car<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:26.570> you'd<00:02:26.750> be<00:02:26.900> wrong<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.650> fact<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.730> was<00:02:28.880> a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
car but you'd be wrong in fact it was a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.780 
car but you'd be wrong in fact it was a
motorcycle<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.900> godly<00:02:30.620> Daimler<00:02:31.160> built<00:02:31.580> that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
motorcycle and godly Daimler built that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.240 
motorcycle and godly Daimler built that
motorcycle<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.660> his<00:02:32.780> garden<00:02:33.230> shed<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:33.980> he

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
motorcycle in his garden shed because he

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.800 
motorcycle in his garden shed because he
didn't<00:02:34.520> have<00:02:34.610> enough<00:02:34.640> room<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.270> bring<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.570> car

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
didn't have enough room to bring a car

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.510 
didn't have enough room to bring a car
in<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.170> out<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.530> car<00:02:36.770> as<00:02:36.890> we<00:02:37.040> would<00:02:37.190> know<00:02:37.340> with

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
in and out the car as we would know with

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.400 
in and out the car as we would know with
four<00:02:37.760> wheels<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.630> instead<00:02:38.900> he<00:02:39.050> built<00:02:39.290> this

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
four wheels so instead he built this

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.340 
four wheels so instead he built this
motorcycle<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.850> in<00:02:41.390> fact<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.110> very

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
motorcycle and it is in fact the very

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.740 
motorcycle and it is in fact the very
first<00:02:42.700> motorized<00:02:43.700> vehicle<00:02:44.210> here<00:02:44.510> in

the three little points on it which

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.520 
the three little points on it which
stands<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.520> air<00:03:01.760> land<00:03:02.480> at<00:03:02.720> sea<00:03:02.990> yes<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:05.750> is

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
stands for air land at sea yes this is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.590 
stands for air land at sea yes this is
actually<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:07.130> world's<00:03:07.460> first<00:03:07.730> motorized

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
actually the world's first motorized

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.090 
actually the world's first motorized
aircraft<00:03:09.140> I'll<00:03:09.350> bet<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.740> lot<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:09.980> you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
aircraft I'll bet you a lot of you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.800 
aircraft I'll bet you a lot of you
thought<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.430> was<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.730> 1903<00:03:11.240> with<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
thought that was the 1903 with the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.750 
thought that was the 1903 with the
Wright<00:03:11.960> brothers<00:03:12.290> but<00:03:12.650> in<00:03:12.770> fact<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:13.610> an

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
Wright brothers but in fact this was an

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.620 
Wright brothers but in fact this was an
1888<00:03:14.450> now<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.410> was<00:03:15.500> attached<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.160> giant

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
1888 now it was attached to a giant

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.010 
1888 now it was attached to a giant
probably<00:03:17.630> very<00:03:17.960> dangerous<00:03:19.570> balloon<00:03:20.570> made<00:03:20.840> out

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
probably very dangerous balloon made out

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.810 
probably very dangerous balloon made out
of<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.200> hood<00:03:21.350> filled<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.800> now<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.310> fact<00:03:22.610> was

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
of the hood filled with now in fact was

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.240 
of the hood filled with now in fact was
attached<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:24.050> balloon<00:03:24.440> filled<00:03:25.040> with

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
attached to a balloon filled with

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.760 
attached to a balloon filled with
hydrogen<00:03:25.910> gas<00:03:25.940> which<00:03:26.660> probably<00:03:27.140> wasn't<00:03:27.590> a

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
hydrogen gas which probably wasn't a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.860 
hydrogen gas which probably wasn't a
great<00:03:28.010> idea<00:03:28.040> considering<00:03:28.820> he<00:03:29.090> had<00:03:29.240> a<00:03:29.270> hot

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
great idea considering he had a hot

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.080 
great idea considering he had a hot
internal<00:03:30.440> combustion<00:03:30.980> engine<00:03:31.370> right<00:03:31.730> below

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
internal combustion engine right below

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.570 
internal combustion engine right below
it<00:03:32.270> what<00:03:32.720> when<00:03:33.680> those<00:03:33.830> two<00:03:34.040> things<00:03:34.220> were<00:03:34.400> put

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
it what when those two things were put

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.160 
it what when those two things were put
together<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:35.300> travelled<00:03:35.780> about<00:03:35.960> eight

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
together this travelled about eight

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.020 
together this travelled about eight
miles<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.740> fact<00:03:37.010> went<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.520> record<00:03:37.820> books

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
miles in fact went in the record books

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.740 
miles in fact went in the record books
as<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.630> world's<00:03:38.930> first<00:03:39.170> motorized<00:03:40.100> aircraft

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
as the world's first motorized aircraft

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.700 
as the world's first motorized aircraft
so<00:03:41.750> if<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.930> know<00:03:42.050> how<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.200> build<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.590> really

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
so if you know how to build a really

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.250 
so if you know how to build a really
good<00:03:42.980> gasoline-powered<00:03:43.640> engine<00:03:44.120> why<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:45.050> put

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
good gasoline-powered engine why not put

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.620 
good gasoline-powered engine why not put
it<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.560> boat<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:46.100> that's<00:03:46.640> exactly<00:03:47.030> what<00:03:47.390> got

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
it in a boat and that's exactly what got

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.780 
it in a boat and that's exactly what got
Gottlieb<00:03:48.080> Daimler<00:03:48.110> did<00:03:48.800> when<00:03:49.310> he<00:03:49.340> built<00:03:49.610> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
Gottlieb Daimler did when he built the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.830 
Gottlieb Daimler did when he built the
world's<00:03:50.120> first<00:03:50.560> motorized<00:03:51.560> boat

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
world's first motorized boat

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.460 
world's first motorized boat
by<00:03:53.349> 1895<00:03:54.160> Carl<00:03:54.760> Ben<00:03:55.150> decided<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.959> he<00:03:56.140> wanted

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
by 1895 Carl Ben decided that he wanted

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.650 
by 1895 Carl Ben decided that he wanted
to<00:03:56.530> build<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.920> bus<00:03:57.250> now<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.120> actually<00:03:58.270> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
to build a bus now this is actually the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.680 
to build a bus now this is actually the
world's<00:03:58.900> first<00:03:59.440> public<00:03:59.860> bus<00:04:00.390> we<00:04:01.390> can<00:04:01.420> take<00:04:01.660> a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
world's first public bus we can take a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.699 
world's first public bus we can take a
look<00:04:01.870> at<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.200> right<00:04:02.470> inside<00:04:02.770> here<00:04:04.230> well<00:04:05.230> in

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
look at it right inside here well in

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.890 
look at it right inside here well in
case<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:06.040> looks<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.370> little<00:04:06.520> bit<00:04:06.900> unfamiliar

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
case it looks a little bit unfamiliar

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.750 
case it looks a little bit unfamiliar
probably<00:04:08.470> looks<00:04:08.650> more<00:04:08.800> like<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.160> I'm<00:04:09.550> like<00:04:09.730> a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
probably looks more like a I'm like a

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.160 
probably looks more like a I'm like a
probably<00:04:10.390> looks<00:04:10.540> more<00:04:10.690> like<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.900> stagecoach

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
probably looks more like a stagecoach

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.290 
probably looks more like a stagecoach
and<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.739> was<00:04:11.830> because<00:04:11.980> Carl<00:04:12.640> Benz<00:04:12.970> didn't

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
and that was because Carl Benz didn't

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.970 
and that was because Carl Benz didn't
want<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.540> shock<00:04:13.810> people<00:04:13.840> by<00:04:14.410> coming<00:04:14.739> up<00:04:14.920> with

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
want to shock people by coming up with

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.170 
want to shock people by coming up with
something<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.489> they<00:04:15.819> weren't<00:04:15.970> familiar

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
something that they weren't familiar

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.449 
something that they weren't familiar
with<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:16.870> he<00:04:16.989> started<00:04:17.590> with<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.859> design<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.250> a

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
with so he started with the design of a

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.370 
with so he started with the design of a
stagecoach<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:19.480> we'll<00:04:19.660> work<00:04:19.810> from<00:04:19.930> there<00:04:20.200> so

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
stagecoach and we'll work from there so

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.840 
stagecoach and we'll work from there so
that's<00:04:20.560> why<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.799> actually<00:04:21.340> looks<00:04:21.579> more<00:04:21.790> like

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
that's why this actually looks more like

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.290 
that's why this actually looks more like
that

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
that

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.270 
that
horse<00:04:22.570> driven<00:04:22.840> stagecoach<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:23.980> is<00:04:24.070> in

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
horse driven stagecoach but it is in

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.080 
horse driven stagecoach but it is in
fact<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.820> world's<00:04:25.450> first<00:04:25.660> bus<00:04:26.940> all<00:04:27.940> right

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
fact the world's first bus all right

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.030 
fact the world's first bus all right
Martin<00:04:28.360> we're<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.870> front<00:04:29.139> of<00:04:29.229> another<00:04:29.530> car<00:04:29.680> now

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
Martin we're in front of another car now

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.640 
Martin we're in front of another car now
this<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.400> actually<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:31.120> first<00:04:31.389> modern<00:04:32.169> car

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
this is actually the first modern car

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.710 
this is actually the first modern car
made<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.889> car<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.460> looks<00:04:33.760> like<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.000> car<00:04:34.360> instead

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
made a car that looks like a car instead

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.320 
made a car that looks like a car instead
of<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.990> carriage<00:04:35.410> right<00:04:35.650> yes<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.340> mean<00:04:36.460> yeah<00:04:37.120> okay

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
of a carriage right yes I mean yeah okay

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.800 
of a carriage right yes I mean yeah okay
and<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:37.930> was<00:04:38.139> designed<00:04:38.320> by<00:04:38.650> wilhelm<00:04:39.810> maybach

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
and this was designed by wilhelm maybach

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.190 
and this was designed by wilhelm maybach
okay<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:41.830> he's<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.639> guy<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.850> engineer<00:04:43.660> with

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
okay so he's the guy the engineer with

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.010 
okay so he's the guy the engineer with
bends<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.860> don't<00:04:45.639> know<00:04:46.180> Daimler<00:04:46.660> okay<00:04:46.960> so

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
bends that don't know Daimler okay so

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.200 
bends that don't know Daimler okay so
he's<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.470> engineer<00:04:47.889> with<00:04:48.250> Daimler<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:49.060> was

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
he's the engineer with Daimler that was

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.390 
he's the engineer with Daimler that was
in<00:04:49.389> charge<00:04:49.630> of<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.260> overall<00:04:50.560> engineering<00:04:51.130> of

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
in charge of the overall engineering of

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.890 
in charge of the overall engineering of
the<00:04:51.520> car<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:51.940> made<00:04:52.389> it<00:04:52.540> look<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.780> little

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
the car and made it look a little

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.440 
the car and made it look a little
different<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:54.490> engines<00:04:54.820> in<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:54.970> front<00:04:55.180> now

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
different the engines in the front now

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.080 
different the engines in the front now
yeah<00:04:56.080> along<00:04:56.950> with<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.190> radiator<00:04:57.669> so<00:04:57.940> that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
yeah along with the radiator so that

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.029 
yeah along with the radiator so that
greatly<00:04:58.570> simplified<00:04:59.140> things<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.800> when

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
greatly simplified things and when

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.010 
greatly simplified things and when
Vanderbilt<00:05:00.640> went<00:05:00.850> for<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.090> drive<00:05:01.450> in<00:05:01.510> those

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
Vanderbilt went for a drive in those

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.740 
Vanderbilt went for a drive in those
days<00:05:02.260> 1902<00:05:02.950> which<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.030> when<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:04.330> car<00:05:04.570> was

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
days 1902 which is when this car was

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.200 
days 1902 which is when this car was
built<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:06.070> wasn't<00:05:06.490> just<00:05:06.669> a<00:05:06.760> matter<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.030> getting

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
built it wasn't just a matter of getting

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.580 
built it wasn't just a matter of getting
the<00:05:07.450> car<00:05:07.630> putting<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.110> key<00:05:08.289> in<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.530> ignition

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the car putting the key in the ignition

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.860 
the car putting the key in the ignition
and<00:05:09.010> taking<00:05:09.370> off<00:05:09.520> he<00:05:09.760> had<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.910> lot<00:05:10.240> of<00:05:10.419> things<00:05:10.660> to

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
and taking off he had a lot of things to

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.680 
and taking off he had a lot of things to
do<00:05:11.020> right<00:05:11.260> we've<00:05:11.979> got<00:05:12.130> all<00:05:12.310> these<00:05:12.690> little

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
do right we've got all these little

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.810 
do right we've got all these little
gauges<00:05:14.650> here<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.950> in<00:05:15.010> fact<00:05:15.190> these<00:05:15.340> are<00:05:15.400> oil

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
gauges here and in fact these are oil

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.029 
gauges here and in fact these are oil
monitors<00:05:16.510> right<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:17.169> be<00:05:17.289> able<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.530> check<00:05:17.830> on

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
monitors right to be able to check on

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.800 
monitors right to be able to check on
the<00:05:18.190> oil<00:05:18.370> levels<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:19.030> all<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.479> different

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
the oil levels of all the different

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.540 
the oil levels of all the different
pieces<00:05:19.930> of<00:05:20.229> machinery<00:05:20.620> in<00:05:20.979> this<00:05:21.539> four-speed

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
pieces of machinery in this four-speed

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.290 
pieces of machinery in this four-speed
Mercedes<00:05:25.620> automobile<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:27.190> he<00:05:27.910> had<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.120> take<00:05:28.240> a

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
Mercedes automobile and he had to take a

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.450 
Mercedes automobile and he had to take a
couple<00:05:28.539> of<00:05:28.720> extra<00:05:28.990> tires<00:05:29.590> along<00:05:30.039> with<00:05:30.280> them

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
couple of extra tires along with them

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.340 
couple of extra tires along with them
because<00:05:30.789> of<00:05:30.970> course<00:05:31.389> getting<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.110> flat<00:05:32.320> tire

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
because of course getting a flat tire

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.750 
because of course getting a flat tire
would<00:05:32.860> be<00:05:32.979> a<00:05:33.010> big<00:05:33.250> problem

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
would be a big problem

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.610 
would be a big problem
now<00:05:34.240> we<00:05:34.300> broke<00:05:34.570> a<00:05:34.600> record<00:05:34.870> into<00:05:35.289> this<00:05:35.410> car

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
now we broke a record into this car

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.219 
now we broke a record into this car
right<00:05:35.830> yeah<00:05:36.520> that's<00:05:36.700> right<00:05:36.970> no<00:05:37.450> records<00:05:38.110> are

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
right yeah that's right no records are

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.480 
right yeah that's right no records are
just<00:05:38.380> were<00:05:38.470> easy<00:05:38.620> to<00:05:38.830> break<00:05:38.979> in<00:05:39.160> those<00:05:39.280> days

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
just were easy to break in those days

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.820
