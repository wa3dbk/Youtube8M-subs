of green lots of peppers on them my
jalapenos<00:04:09.550> they're<00:04:10.120> picking<00:04:10.420> them<00:04:10.569> they're

now<00:04:16.650> these<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:17.039> think<00:04:17.219> would<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.459> first

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:17.819 
now these I think would be the first

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.610 
now these I think would be the first
cherries<00:04:18.269> I'll<00:04:18.419> get<00:04:18.629> where<00:04:18.900> I'm<00:04:19.259> starting<00:04:19.469> to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
cherries I'll get where I'm starting to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.540 
cherries I'll get where I'm starting to
turn

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:36.850 

and<00:04:25.870> see<00:04:26.870> here<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.710> more<00:04:34.340> peppers<00:04:34.820> there<00:04:35.860> now

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
and see here and more peppers there now

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:48.510 
and see here and more peppers there now
there's<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.160> big<00:04:37.430> main<00:04:37.760> of<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.030> boulder

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.469 

so<00:04:49.330> anyway<00:04:49.599> yeah<00:04:49.810> everything's<00:04:50.229> doing<00:04:50.379> good<00:04:50.620> I

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
so anyway yeah everything's doing good I

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.100 
so anyway yeah everything's doing good I
think<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.629> is<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.810> Brandywine<00:04:54.960> heirloom<00:04:55.960> and

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
think this is a Brandywine heirloom and

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.180 
think this is a Brandywine heirloom and
it's<00:04:56.229> doing<00:04:56.470> well<00:04:58.020> so<00:05:00.060> there's<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.150> heirloom

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
it's doing well so there's a heirloom

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.700 
it's doing well so there's a heirloom
not<00:05:03.190> sure<00:05:03.370> which<00:05:03.550> one<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.879> one<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:05.560> got

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
not sure which one that one is it's got

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.300 
not sure which one that one is it's got
tomatoes<00:05:06.159> on<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:07.590> these<00:05:08.590> carrots<00:05:08.979> are<00:05:09.099> going

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
tomatoes on it these carrots are going

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.040 
tomatoes on it these carrots are going
slow<00:05:09.550> too<00:05:09.819> because<00:05:10.240> they<00:05:10.360> only<00:05:10.509> get<00:05:10.659> probably

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
slow too because they only get probably

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.300 
slow too because they only get probably
four<00:05:11.319> or<00:05:11.560> five<00:05:12.250> hours<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.639> sunlight<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.270> day

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
four or five hours of sunlight a day

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.999 
four or five hours of sunlight a day
anyhow<00:05:16.289> and<00:05:17.289> I<00:05:17.500> don't<00:05:17.650> know<00:05:17.710> what<00:05:17.830> I'm<00:05:17.919> going
