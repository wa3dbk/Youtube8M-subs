this later this little machine right

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.389 
this later this little machine right
here<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.559> guys<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.340> about

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to show off the solar panel or i should

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.060 
to show off the solar panel or i should
say<00:01:08.340> i<00:01:08.549> hope<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.930> sensor<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.830> solar

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
say i hope they like sensor is a solar

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.940 
say i hope they like sensor is a solar
panel<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.880> anyways<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.750> Sun<00:01:13.049> where<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> Sun

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
panel so anyways the Sun where the Sun

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.830 
panel so anyways the Sun where the Sun
is<00:01:13.979> worrisome<00:01:14.670> there's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> son<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.540> right

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
is worrisome there's a son is right

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.990 
is worrisome there's a son is right
there<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> Sun<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.670> course

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
there so the Sun is actually of course

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
there so the Sun is actually of course
hitting<00:01:18.360> off<00:01:18.479> light<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> hitting<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> solar

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
hitting off light and hitting the solar

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.240 
hitting off light and hitting the solar
panel<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.790> daylight<00:01:21.090> sensor<00:01:21.479> should<00:01:21.630> say<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
panel or daylight sensor should say and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240 
panel or daylight sensor should say and
depending<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.900> strong<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.650> sunlight<00:01:26.220> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
depending on how strong the sunlight is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.850 
depending on how strong the sunlight is
and<00:01:26.729> where<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.090> located<00:01:27.500> maybe<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.710> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and where it's located maybe if it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.310 
and where it's located maybe if it's
going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.340> cut<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> sunset<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.150> sunrise

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
going to be cut like a sunset or sunrise

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.999 
going to be cut like a sunset or sunrise
something's<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> powerful

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
something's not going to be a powerful

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.609 
something's not going to be a powerful
so<00:01:32.810> sometimes<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> light<00:01:34.500> up

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
so sometimes it's not going to light up

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.450 
so sometimes it's not going to light up
the<00:01:34.650> as<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:35.909> redstone<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.100> as
