00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 now as then we are recording exam 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.090
 did doing this other video neo 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.880
 in the recipes from zeman have this is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.699
 a little tutorial that we'll do because 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 it happens many people have them 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 problems when loading nests or 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.500
 on youtube because you so then us 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.920
 on a single cable and we put his own immediately 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 just debated logic because 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 we say about julia is a talented man 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.090
 because I'm going to work on the jobs 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.820
 then we upload a video upload one of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.750
 nusco as well as on the key occasion of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 disabilities nicolosi in bosnia and when 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.340
 for example, let's take this video i 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 fans goals that I then on this 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.090
 video may be that in to upload it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.390
 due perhaps before 99 percent e 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.760
 not of the charge I want there is says maldini 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 is practically sends a message says 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 your video has been queued 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.880
 because it is an overload 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.180
 then you better get rid of the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.600
 video because it won't trace anyone 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.710
 video planet and then you have no firefox 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 firefox is different age equal with instead 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.400
 safari you are well studying b not of the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.710
 charge 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.689
 then you see me in this case at the foot 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 loading there are problems from 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.700
 part of a good upload video so it is 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.909
 needless to wait useless to load 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.250
 this video then happens that sometimes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.310
 a person is annoyed to wait 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.950
 because it has reached 99 percent three 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.049
 loading times and no longer loads 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 I invite then what it does to nothing and 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.210
 load 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.700
 so sitting I have practically here 1 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 year 1 loading 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.760
 in fact he didn't give it to me as an even 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.460
 the subscription because he was not even 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.390
 initials or loading then when you 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.510
 you want to upload the video enough 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.310
 simply put the same video but 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.040
 change the title a bit then me 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:26.190
 title here I wrote then iphone yes 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.150
 record iphone recording does me 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.200
 i was wrong zum zum camera ed 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 special effects 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.510
 then I modify suunto finally enough 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.739
 just that I do 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.750
 practically special effects but the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.660
 mortify I can only say a druse 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.380
 letter letter the sick then 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.560
 this change is practically for 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.570
 youtube in this change that you have 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.660
 done by youtube google will be putting 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.640
 a progressive then every time you do 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.940
 presents the same problem 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.430
 you can do this you brake see the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.570
 video the title of was changed 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.190
 exploited confapi takes on a garment that 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.040
 many of you have these problems 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.890
 so every time the video comes 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.660
 is not then loaded for 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.610
 reload the same video is enough 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.330
 simply that tiber stories now 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.370
 inside a word you see no cameras 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.720
 and special effects 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.450
 the reds to the so before we had loaded 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.870
 with special effects spatial your mou 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.510
 this minimal difference between claiming 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.540
 another video is not the same video 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.970
 the deal then until you don't 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.700
 you have the possibility that video comes 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.530
 loaded then change time is a word 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.410
 not to a word and then later 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.670
 readjust the title when you are 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.070
 uploading the video or micro on this is 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.010
 something that happens often because you 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.769
 you have to imagine youtube 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:15.049
 then at least 50 thousand videos a day 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.000
 logically it is not that it is only you 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.900
 upload videos so they could 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.090
 be problems but as a matter of course 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.800
 so when they happen in these 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.229
 problems that often happen e 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.180
 willingly 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.990
 make this system without you 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.050
 cheated 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.050
 ok so bye bye to all and see you 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.310
 this recipe from the dance that is very good 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.940
 made this cat of fragrant al 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.570
 you can see parsley with sausages 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.370
 shortly on jumble recipes then 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.710
 hello hello everyone 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.979
 but returning to the league, reasoning about journeys for the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.979
 channel
