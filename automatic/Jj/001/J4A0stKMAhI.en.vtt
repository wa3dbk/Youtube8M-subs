hey whats up guys is Mike and today
we're<00:00:02.830> going<00:00:02.920> to<00:00:02.980> be<00:00:03.070> talking<00:00:03.220> about<00:00:03.460> bulking

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.000 
we're going to be talking about bulking

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.360 
we're going to be talking about bulking
up<00:00:04.149> versus<00:00:04.750> leaning<00:00:05.200> down<00:00:05.380> when<00:00:05.890> should<00:00:06.339> you

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
up versus leaning down when should you

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.490 
up versus leaning down when should you
lean<00:00:07.150> down<00:00:07.180> but<00:00:07.750> the<00:00:07.839> reason<00:00:07.990> I'm<00:00:08.200> talking

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
lean down but the reason I'm talking

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.020 
lean down but the reason I'm talking
about<00:00:08.559> this<00:00:08.889> is<00:00:09.039> because<00:00:09.309> I<00:00:09.340> find<00:00:09.700> there's<00:00:09.940> a

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
about this is because I find there's a

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.090 
about this is because I find there's a
lot<00:00:10.299> of<00:00:10.330> guys<00:00:10.660> that<00:00:10.690> are<00:00:11.230> stuck<00:00:11.619> in<00:00:11.830> this

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
lot of guys that are stuck in this

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.850 
lot of guys that are stuck in this
permanent<00:00:12.789> bulking<00:00:13.570> phase<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:14.350> problem<00:00:14.709> with

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
permanent bulking phase the problem with

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.490 
permanent bulking phase the problem with
that<00:00:14.889> is<00:00:15.070> if<00:00:15.549> you<00:00:15.670> never<00:00:15.969> lean<00:00:16.330> down<00:00:16.600> there's<00:00:17.439> a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
that is if you never lean down there's a

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.820 
that is if you never lean down there's a
good<00:00:17.830> chance<00:00:18.189> that<00:00:19.150> you'll<00:00:19.420> never<00:00:19.960> lean<00:00:20.589> down

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
good chance that you'll never lean down

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.380 
good chance that you'll never lean down
now<00:00:21.160> you<00:00:21.220> might<00:00:21.490> be<00:00:21.609> going<00:00:21.820> on<00:00:21.910> that's<00:00:22.150> silly

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
now you might be going on that's silly

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.329 
now you might be going on that's silly

Mike I like to lay down all i have to do

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.700 
Mike I like to lay down all i have to do
is<00:00:24.490> just<00:00:24.609> lean<00:00:24.789> down<00:00:24.939> okay<00:00:25.449> but<00:00:25.900> if<00:00:26.259> you've

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
is just lean down okay but if you've

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.040 
is just lean down okay but if you've
never<00:00:27.009> done<00:00:27.339> it<00:00:27.490> before<00:00:27.660> how<00:00:28.660> do<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.869> know

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
never done it before how do you know

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.599 
never done it before how do you know
that<00:00:29.259> you<00:00:29.349> can<00:00:29.499> do<00:00:29.650> it<00:00:29.829> a<00:00:29.980> lot<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:30.279> times<00:00:30.429> people

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
that you can do it a lot of times people

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.609 
that you can do it a lot of times people
tell<00:00:31.029> themselves<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.630> can<00:00:31.900> do<00:00:32.020> this<00:00:32.169> I<00:00:32.380> can<00:00:32.410> do

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
tell themselves I can do this I can do

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.020 
tell themselves I can do this I can do
that<00:00:32.829> you<00:00:33.010> know<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.129> can<00:00:33.309> do<00:00:33.399> this<00:00:33.430> oh<00:00:33.730> yeah<00:00:34.000> I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
that you know I can do this oh yeah I

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.180 
that you know I can do this oh yeah I
can<00:00:34.239> but<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:35.079> doesn't<00:00:35.350> matter<00:00:35.410> what<00:00:35.649> you<00:00:35.800> say

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
can but it doesn't matter what you say

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.100 
can but it doesn't matter what you say
it<00:00:36.489> only<00:00:36.610> matters<00:00:37.059> what<00:00:37.270> you<00:00:37.329> have<00:00:37.719> done

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
it only matters what you have done

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.439 
it only matters what you have done
because<00:00:38.739> we<00:00:38.890> done<00:00:39.070> something<00:00:39.309> once<00:00:39.670> then

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
because we done something once then

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.450 
because we done something once then
there's<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:40.960> likelihood<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.500> you<00:00:41.800> can<00:00:42.010> do<00:00:42.340> it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
there's a likelihood that you can do it

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.549 
there's a likelihood that you can do it
again<00:00:42.670> okay<00:00:43.390> with<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.840> done<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.469> before

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
again okay with that you done it before

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.770 
again okay with that you done it before
proves<00:00:45.219> that<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.489> know<00:00:45.640> how<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:45.879> do<00:00:46.090> it<00:00:46.239> versus

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
proves that you know how to do it versus

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.900 
proves that you know how to do it versus
if<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.379> never<00:00:47.620> done<00:00:47.859> something<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.489> chances

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
if you never done something the chances

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.240 
if you never done something the chances
of<00:00:48.940> you<00:00:49.180> doing<00:00:50.019> it<00:00:50.140> is<00:00:50.350> slim<00:00:50.649> until<00:00:51.100> you've

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
of you doing it is slim until you've

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.770 
of you doing it is slim until you've
done<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.609> a<00:00:51.730> lot<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.000> these<00:00:52.059> bulk<00:00:52.329> meet<00:00:52.570> lot<00:00:52.719> of

these guys in these bulky permanent

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.560 
these guys in these bulky permanent
bulking<00:00:54.399> phases<00:00:54.730> have<00:00:54.850> never<00:00:55.179> leaned<00:00:55.510> down

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
bulking phases have never leaned down

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.869 
bulking phases have never leaned down
their<00:00:55.899> life<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.379> they<00:00:56.859> continue<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.519> bulk<00:00:57.730> up

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
their life and they continue to bulk up

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
really getting more results number one

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.630 
really getting more results number one
the<00:01:02.109> only<00:01:02.410> thing<00:01:02.589> they're<00:01:02.769> not<00:01:02.980> doing<00:01:03.280> is

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the only thing they're not doing is

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.820 
the only thing they're not doing is
they're<00:01:03.820> not<00:01:04.059> being<00:01:04.330> mean<00:01:04.510> ever<00:01:04.990> they're<00:01:05.590> just

they're not being mean ever they're just
always<00:01:06.010> you<00:01:06.580> know<00:01:06.640> fluctuating<00:01:07.390> around<00:01:07.570> this

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
always you know fluctuating around this

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.840 
always you know fluctuating around this
body<00:01:07.960> weight<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.470> they<00:01:08.620> like<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.250> be<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.550> even

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
body weight that they like to be in even

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.730 
body weight that they like to be in even
though<00:01:10.150> in<00:01:10.270> their<00:01:10.420> mine<00:01:10.690> they<00:01:11.320> keep<00:01:11.560> telling

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
though in their mine they keep telling

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.680 
though in their mine they keep telling
themselves<00:01:11.980> you<00:01:12.760> know<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.210> little<00:01:13.480> more

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
themselves you know just a little more

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.920 
themselves you know just a little more
and<00:01:13.930> I'm<00:01:14.050> gonna<00:01:14.140> lean<00:01:14.350> down<00:01:14.530> guys<00:01:14.980> you<00:01:15.820> have<00:01:16.240> to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
and I'm gonna lean down guys you have to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.650 
and I'm gonna lean down guys you have to
lean<00:01:17.680> down<00:01:17.710> for<00:01:18.370> once<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.880> your<00:01:18.910> life<00:01:19.150> just<00:01:19.180> to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
lean down for once in your life just to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.690 
lean down for once in your life just to
prove<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:20.110> yourself<00:01:20.500> that<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.980> can<00:01:21.010> do<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.490> but

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
prove to yourself that you can do it but

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.820 
prove to yourself that you can do it but
also<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.180> understand<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.050> process<00:01:23.620> of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
also to understand the process of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.950 
also to understand the process of
getting<00:01:24.250> lean<00:01:24.580> because<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.480> process<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
getting lean because the process of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.330 
getting lean because the process of
getting<00:01:26.080> lean<00:01:26.410> versus<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.920> process<00:01:27.250> of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
getting lean versus the process of

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.040 
getting lean versus the process of
bulking<00:01:27.640> up<00:01:27.760> is<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.030> little<00:01:28.360> bit<00:01:28.480> different<00:01:28.900> you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
bulking up is a little bit different you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.330 
bulking up is a little bit different you

doesn't<00:02:59.430> mean<00:02:59.670> you're<00:02:59.910> not<00:03:00.030> getting<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.390> same

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
doesn't mean you're not getting the same

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.180 
doesn't mean you're not getting the same
results<00:03:01.080> because<00:03:01.410> that's<00:03:01.710> just<00:03:01.800> how<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.100> is

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
results because that's just how it is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.130 
results because that's just how it is
when<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.300> body<00:03:03.480> fat<00:03:03.630> when<00:03:04.020> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
when you have more body fat when you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.260 
when you have more body fat when you
weigh<00:03:04.320> more<00:03:04.620> you're<00:03:05.010> stronger<00:03:05.490> naturally<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
weigh more you're stronger naturally and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.960 
weigh more you're stronger naturally and
vice<00:03:07.110> versa<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.920> lean<00:03:08.190> down<00:03:08.220> you're

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
vice versa when you lean down you're

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.490 
vice versa when you lean down you're
going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> little<00:03:09.420> bit<00:03:09.570> weaker<00:03:09.930> okay

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
going to be a little bit weaker okay

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.110 
going to be a little bit weaker okay
that's<00:03:10.710> just<00:03:10.860> how<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.670> guys<00:03:11.850> have

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
that's just how it is for guys have

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.980 
that's just how it is for guys have
