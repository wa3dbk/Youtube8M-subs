00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.809
 yes hello dear friends we are today 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.620
 Here in the fishing park in Limburg Linter 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.900
 John Huston deep in the taunus of today 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.059
 Watten four hours I have on 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.649
 but I wanted you today 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.970
 a few things from the program 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:53.260
 Introduce 2014 of ironport and japan 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.629
 Just with the route to the camera 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.769
 in the whole world 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.160
 only the most hits of all rests the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.530
 Company say good on the phone 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.269
 for the copen one says here 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.910
 many may have just been infected 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.970
 need that has good reasons 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.380
 I'm often asked by many 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.539
 that foreigners good for 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.649
 triptis kamarilla fishing what do you want 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.539
 because there and without the 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.640
 pink glasses of the company singer too 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.890
 I have to say one clearly 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.729
 Beginners are ideal 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.590
 our newest baby chaka chaka 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.840
 There are two meters 70 and 3 meters 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.739
 length each with a weight of 1 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.160
 to 6 grams 

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:37.810
 that was with the 70 model has one 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.630
 weight of 170 grams so very much 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 easy is a two-part plug route 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 very easy to handle 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.500
 especially if you like the long thriller 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.640
 sees routes and you may have one 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.440
 bit too grown or 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.629
 It's not like that sometimes 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.030
 board not bright route usually has 

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:56.649
 so a length of three meters emanates that 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 be going then up to four meters fifty 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.039
 and that is, of course, for one 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.080
 not so easy to handle 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.470
 on the other hand 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.490
 so the room routing cheating caution 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.170
 To enjoy are generally good 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.150
 Of course, one thing in common 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 that is the incredibly sensitive tip 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.630
 which, however, also tends to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.690
 to break 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.030
 if you make mistakes marella 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.770
 Distributing routes can mean mistakes 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.490
 I woman the route on which you with 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.650
 a pond 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.590
 it finds a bit the rudi falls over 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.270
 so off the top 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.480
 most always have upper entringen 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.530
 breaks the top same happens too 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 if you like when turning the fish too 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.240
 hard takes on and the angle too sharp 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.330
 is between string and then directs 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.950
 If she continues, she breaks the route 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.640
 then quite happy if the above 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.430
 cord turns over and just completely 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.000
 Extremely there then usually in several 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.350
 parts 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 if you get stuck in projects in 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.380
 the bushes then good stand where too 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.600
 then you always have five parts 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.870
 yes this one was not the hacker 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.420
 that is our stuck had relative 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.380
 continuous action which you the times 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.380
 may show briefly 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.440
 also a very soft tip just 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.040
 Also where to get wonderful with the bait 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.860
 but it can shake through the water 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.230
 anyway a relatively hook left then the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.420
 second part of the route becomes relative 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.830
 is where you are sometimes bigger 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.180
 fish can offer but in 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.280
 First line is a job as I said 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.140
 had entry level red pedestrian lights from 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.000
 Price very interesting, I have to say 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.330
 so I just really very 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.110
 very cheap money already seen and 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.360
 I just have to be there 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.830
 Huge fun makes the huge fun too 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.710
 time to catch a small trout 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.490
 maybe with 250 300 grams again 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.100
 Everytime is an experience extra 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.740
 book weight we fish these routes 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.920
 with the pale or with the lead chain 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.300
 or not on roses montage of 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.630
 three frames of five grams 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.190
 with glass over lead short incident 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.820
 of course my beloved back and 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.530
 Of course not missing 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.730
 everything that goes with it, of course, is there 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.870
 I am also twirling along with the brilliant five 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.300
 also very good find 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.920
 Of course, there's also a program 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.790
 herb still 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.440
 as I said, the hacker is allowed to do so 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.980
 Of course a new policy is missing 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.729
 the whole thing is out now we have the 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.629
 fx t 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.580
 and that's really a lot, too 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:46.699
 nice here as 1000 of the version with the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:50.629
 mono 1 1 played that was a shock that 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.489
 Sound sounds like a resort 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.219
