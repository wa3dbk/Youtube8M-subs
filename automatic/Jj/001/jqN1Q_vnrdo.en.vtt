00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the test and start filming new bike to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.540 
the test and start filming new bike to
see<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.130> it<00:00:41.220> can<00:00:41.280> do

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 

we're<00:00:48.180> trying<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.570> dynamic<00:00:49.110> shots<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
we're trying to get dynamic shots that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.650 
we're trying to get dynamic shots that
you<00:00:49.920> can't<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.309> any<00:00:50.520> other<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.450> I'm

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you can't get any other way so I'm

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can't get any other way so I'm
actually<00:00:51.870> flying<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.620> copter<00:00:53.090> tracking<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
actually flying the copter tracking the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.540 
actually flying the copter tracking the
guys<00:00:54.360> lining<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.410> shots<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.250> going

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
guys lining up the shots you know going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
guys lining up the shots you know going
in<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.790> out<00:00:57.769> there's<00:00:58.769> been<00:00:58.890> quite<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.129> few

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
in and out there's been quite a few

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.759 
in and out there's been quite a few
shots<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.840> example<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.470> when<00:01:01.649> I'm

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
shots like for example one when I'm

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.219 
shots like for example one when I'm
staging<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:03.000> kind<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.720> hard<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> stage

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
staging up is kind of hard to stage

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
staging up is kind of hard to stage
because<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> thing<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.280> smooth<00:01:05.700> usually

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
because the thing was so smooth usually

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
because the thing was so smooth usually
you're<00:01:06.450> seeing<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> diol<00:01:07.320> movement<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.009> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you're seeing the diol movement of the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
you're seeing the diol movement of the
copter<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.750> perfectly

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
copter and now it's just perfectly

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.980 
copter and now it's just perfectly
stable<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:12.210> having<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> actually<00:01:12.659> catch

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
stable so I was having to actually catch

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990 
stable so I was having to actually catch
myself<00:01:13.259> and<00:01:13.649> figure<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> copter<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
myself and figure out the copter is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
myself and figure out the copter is
pointing<00:01:15.420> forward<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.409> didn't<00:01:16.619> realize

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
pointing forward I just didn't realize

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.090 
pointing forward I just didn't realize
it<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.399> was<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.670> damn<00:01:17.850> smooth<00:01:18.270> that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
it because it was so damn smooth that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.889 
it because it was so damn smooth that
alone<00:01:20.100> being<00:01:20.550> able<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:21.060> follow<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.600> your

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
alone being able to follow because your

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.420 
alone being able to follow because your
copter<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.440> y'all<00:01:22.680> no<00:01:22.920> matter<00:01:23.100> what

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
copter is going to y'all no matter what

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
copter is going to y'all no matter what
you're<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.940> win<00:01:24.149> interaction

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you're going to have win interaction

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
you're going to have win interaction
you're<00:01:24.899> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.259> GPS<00:01:26.250> interaction

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you're going to have GPS interaction

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.400 
you're going to have GPS interaction
it's<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> cause<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> copper<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> move

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
it's going to cause the copper to move

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.740 
it's going to cause the copper to move
but<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.039> that<00:01:29.190> new<00:01:29.340> third<00:01:29.610> axis<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.450> shot

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
but with that new third axis this shot

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.930 
but with that new third axis this shot
was<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.259> dead<00:01:31.590> locked<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> subject

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
was just dead locked on to the subject

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.270 
was just dead locked on to the subject
so<00:01:33.450> being<00:01:33.690> able<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> create<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.710> track

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so being able to create that and track

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.330 
so being able to create that and track
out<00:01:35.490> without<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:35.940> moving<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.360> love<00:01:37.050> it

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.760 

is<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:43.149> tool<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.869> be<00:01:43.990> able<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.259> go<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.560> create

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
is the tool to be able to go and create

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.370 
is the tool to be able to go and create
shots<00:01:45.070> like<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.640> go<00:01:45.789> from<00:01:46.119> up<00:01:46.810> close<00:01:46.840> and

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
shots like this to go from up close and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.560 
shots like this to go from up close and
macro<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.250> be<00:01:48.340> able<00:01:48.429> to<00:01:48.579> pull<00:01:48.820> out<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.210> go<00:01:49.329> wide

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
macro to be able to pull out and go wide

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.010 
macro to be able to pull out and go wide
is<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:52.149> amazing<00:01:52.689> because<00:01:52.780> you

blown<00:02:22.540> away<00:02:22.690> because<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.349> was<00:02:23.380> locked<00:02:23.709> on<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
