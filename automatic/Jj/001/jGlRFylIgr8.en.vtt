00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
because anyone who is purely positive or

because anyone who is purely positive or
purely<00:00:11.490> negative<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.710> not<00:00:13.710> reliable<00:00:14.099> the

purely negative is not reliable the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.310 
purely negative is not reliable the
short<00:00:15.059> version<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
short version about what I'm about to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.970 
short version about what I'm about to
explore<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:18.230> Toradora<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.470> actually<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
explore is that Toradora was actually a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
explore is that Toradora was actually a
whole<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.490> better<00:00:21.090> than<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> expected<00:00:21.539> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
whole lot better than I expected it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710 
whole lot better than I expected it
would<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.859> went<00:00:23.519> into<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:23.970> very<00:00:24.420> low

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
would be I went into it with very low

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.029 
would be I went into it with very low
expectations<00:00:25.640> because<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:28.560> felt

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
expectations because of how I have felt

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.420 
expectations because of how I have felt
about<00:00:29.640> previous<00:00:30.449> emotional<00:00:31.260> teenagers<00:00:32.099> in

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
about previous emotional teenagers in

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.350 
about previous emotional teenagers in
high<00:00:32.460> school

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
high school

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020 
high school
animes<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:34.800> you've<00:00:35.010> pretty<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.520> figured

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
animes well you've pretty much figured

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
animes well you've pretty much figured
out<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> series<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.620> end<00:00:37.850> after

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
out how the series is going to end after

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.630 
out how the series is going to end after
watching<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> first<00:00:40.290> episode<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.129> think

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
watching just the first episode I think

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.840 
watching just the first episode I think
that<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> series<00:00:42.629> went<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.730> reaching<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that the series went about reaching that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.290 
that the series went about reaching that
climax<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.550> interesting<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> fun<00:00:47.940> way

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
climax in a very interesting and fun way

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
climax in a very interesting and fun way
most<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> characters<00:00:49.649> were<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:49.860> solid

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
most of the characters were very solid

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
most of the characters were very solid
and<00:00:50.579> well<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> first<00:00:51.840> half

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and well I do think that the first half

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
and well I do think that the first half
of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> series<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.920> better<00:00:53.309> than<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> second

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
of the series was better than the second

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.389 
of the series was better than the second
half<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.809> appreciate<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> creative

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
half I can appreciate the creative

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.270 
half I can appreciate the creative
approach<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:58.070> making<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
approach that they put into making the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.819 
approach that they put into making the
characters<00:00:59.760> involve<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.750> individual<00:01:01.620> ways

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
characters involve in individual ways

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.340 
characters involve in individual ways
the<00:01:02.489> ending<00:01:03.030> itself<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.870> last<00:01:04.080> three

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the ending itself the last three

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.880 
the ending itself the last three
episodes<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> vibe<00:01:05.909> gets<00:01:06.600> very

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
episodes I get the vibe gets very

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.170 
episodes I get the vibe gets very
polarizing<00:01:07.890> reactions<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:08.580> fans<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
polarizing reactions from fans of that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
polarizing reactions from fans of that
show<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.500> either<00:01:10.740> love<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.310> or

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
show and that they either love it or

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.600 
show and that they either love it or
they<00:01:11.880> hate<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.380> personally<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.590> didn't<00:01:14.369> love<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they hate it personally I didn't love it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660 
they hate it personally I didn't love it
but<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.810> could<00:01:16.080> appreciate<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> creative<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
but I could appreciate the creative and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.330 
but I could appreciate the creative and
unconventional<00:01:18.560> aspects<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> went<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
unconventional aspects that went into it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
all that being said let's go into these
points<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.640> deeper<00:01:24.150> starting<00:01:24.869> with

points a little bit deeper starting with

me the attitude towards these characters

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.599 
me the attitude towards these characters

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
there with it until about the end of

there with it until about the end of
episode<00:04:56.780> 24<00:04:57.650> which<00:04:58.370> is<00:04:58.550> when<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:58.850> felt<00:04:59.360> the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
episode 24 which is when I felt the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.020 
episode 24 which is when I felt the

understand<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.900> sudden<00:05:03.610> inherent<00:05:04.610> feeling

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
understand the sudden inherent feeling

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.130 
understand the sudden inherent feeling
of<00:05:05.780> suffocating<00:05:06.590> loneliness<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:07.760> they<00:05:07.970> were

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
of suffocating loneliness that they were

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.110 
of suffocating loneliness that they were
shoving<00:05:09.140> on<00:05:09.320> every<00:05:09.890> character<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:10.670> it<00:05:10.760> felt

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
shoving on every character so it felt

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.930 
shoving on every character so it felt
really<00:05:11.600> forced<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.590> me<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.340> other<00:05:13.430> hand<00:05:13.730> I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
really forced to me on the other hand I

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.600 
really forced to me on the other hand I
heard<00:05:14.210> people<00:05:14.720> saying<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.740> it's<00:05:15.980> beautiful

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
heard people saying that it's beautiful

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.520 
heard people saying that it's beautiful
and<00:05:16.760> artistic<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.420> perfect<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.140> think<00:05:18.410> it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
and artistic and perfect so I think it

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.310 
and artistic and perfect so I think it
really<00:05:18.650> just<00:05:18.950> depends<00:05:19.820> on<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.840> whether

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
really just depends on you whether

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.010 
really just depends on you whether
you're<00:05:22.100> going<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.700> like<00:05:22.970> this<00:05:23.210> ending<00:05:23.600> it's

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
it's really just about your own personal

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.430

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
I'm very glad I watched it the premise

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.660 
I'm very glad I watched it the premise
of<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.150> show<00:06:20.390> set<00:06:21.350> it<00:06:21.500> up<00:06:21.650> to<00:06:21.890> be<00:06:22.040> fluffy<00:06:22.550> and

generic but it broke away from that and

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.940 
generic but it broke away from that and
it<00:06:25.250> became<00:06:25.580> something<00:06:26.120> meaningful<00:06:27.020> and<00:06:27.530> fun

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950

it was mindless when you wanted it to be
mindless
