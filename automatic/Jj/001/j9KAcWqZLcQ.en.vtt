00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
to apply some glue on it just like you

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.860 
to apply some glue on it just like you
would<00:04:43.620> do<00:04:43.770> any<00:04:43.950> other<00:04:44.130> eyelash<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:45.510> apply<00:04:45.840> it

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
would do any other eyelash and apply it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.530 
would do any other eyelash and apply it
on<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.410> lower<00:04:46.860> lash<00:04:47.160> line<00:04:47.430> underneath<00:04:48.060> the

on the lower lash line underneath the
lash<00:04:48.720> line<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.710> they<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:50.070> look<00:04:50.190> more<00:04:50.400> natural

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530
