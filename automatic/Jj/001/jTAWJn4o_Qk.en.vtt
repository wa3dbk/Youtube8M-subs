00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.760
 so there bless is in case he is 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:14.310
 with 22 transistors two circuits then 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.500
 it is Trifi has three wires is three is filar 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:24.090
 being powered by a battery of a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.100
 notebook is finally there that happens to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 output of the circuit by supplying 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.790
 carrying this battery and this battery 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.060
 which is being charged by the generator 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.760
 also on the diode bridge below the 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.390
 bpn has a little time and has the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.030
 coils both generating and for mine 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 surprise he is really loading 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 started at 12 and 22 and is now 12 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.570
 36 is slowly loading this 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.289
 battery is charging so I go 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.050
 Then analyze it better, that's it. 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.079
 see if I 'm really getting it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.650
 charge an extra battery beyond the 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:10.799
 charging battery or I also want to see if 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 I can or meaning is its use one 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.780
 battery to charge a second 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.850
 normal process of the bpn and a third 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 with a generator that I did 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.450
 taking advantage of the vote asking 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.020
 this is a possibility 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.540
 the other is to use this rectifier point 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.630
 there instead of halimi is to feed a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.630
 battery to return to the battery. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.270
 drive to see if I can retro 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 feeding the battery 1 that is by 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.020
 at least a little more than 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.850
 battery 1 if I can do it if 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.229
 wear more slowly or do 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.930
 last longer 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.820
 is already an advantage also perhaps instead 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.990
 to charge three batteries I charge 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 four or five more with a 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.030
 feedback based on this 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 Generator I did already would be a great 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.479
 advantage 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.479
 okay, bye
