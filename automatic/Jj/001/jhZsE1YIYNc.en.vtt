00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.840 

let's<00:00:05.680> talk<00:00:05.830> about<00:00:05.950> using<00:00:06.160> an<00:00:06.340> electric<00:00:06.670> tuner

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
let's talk about using an electric tuner

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.120 
let's talk about using an electric tuner
it's<00:00:07.090> probably<00:00:07.390> the<00:00:07.450> best<00:00:07.630> way<00:00:07.960> to<00:00:08.290> tune<00:00:08.800> it's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
it's probably the best way to tune it's

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.039 
it's probably the best way to tune it's
the<00:00:09.250> easiest<00:00:09.580> but<00:00:10.240> a<00:00:10.299> little<00:00:10.510> more<00:00:10.690> expensive

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
the easiest but a little more expensive

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.290 
the easiest but a little more expensive
right<00:00:11.530> we<00:00:12.040> have<00:00:12.160> a<00:00:12.190> little<00:00:12.430> guitar<00:00:12.580> pedal<00:00:13.030> here

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
right we have a little guitar pedal here

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.970 
right we have a little guitar pedal here
and<00:00:13.450> this<00:00:14.290> is<00:00:14.410> probably<00:00:14.620> about<00:00:14.740> a<00:00:14.830> hundred

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
and this is probably about a hundred

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.010 
and this is probably about a hundred
dollars<00:00:15.190> at<00:00:15.849> your<00:00:15.970> local<00:00:16.150> music<00:00:16.330> store<00:00:16.540> so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
dollars at your local music store so

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.960 
dollars at your local music store so
that's<00:00:17.170> quite<00:00:17.349> an<00:00:17.470> investment<00:00:17.980> but<00:00:18.279> you<00:00:18.820> can

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
that's quite an investment but you can

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.749 
that's quite an investment but you can
use<00:00:19.119> this<00:00:19.360> when<00:00:19.660> performing<00:00:20.140> on<00:00:20.349> stage<00:00:20.830> and

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
use this when performing on stage and

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.460 
use this when performing on stage and
inside<00:00:22.119> your<00:00:22.300> house<00:00:22.450> so<00:00:22.779> you're<00:00:23.230> just<00:00:23.320> going

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
to hook it up to your electric guitar

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.999 
to hook it up to your electric guitar

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
into the input and then from the output

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.330 
into the input and then from the output

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
string is in tune then I can move on to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.550 
string is in tune then I can move on to
the<00:01:05.909> fifth<00:01:06.030> string<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.530> should
