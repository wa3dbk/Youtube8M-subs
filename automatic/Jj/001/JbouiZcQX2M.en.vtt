00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone with you nastya around and studio 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.690
 production 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.420
 and today I would like to discuss with you 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.090
 schools and of course some situations 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.810
 which are characteristic of her so 3 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:21.539
 We look so let's analyze the first situation 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.300
 I think she knows everything. 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.580
 this is when your teacher starts yelling at 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 your whole class will blame us tom what are you 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 stupid incompetent children and do not want to learn 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 yes but most of the teachers and especially 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.790
 to yell about being so stupid 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:48.629
 or that we will never pass the exam and 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.910
 but there just need to add 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.989
 that stupid people in the world does not happen 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 There is only a lazy concept 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.590
 bones is the sheer absence of brains and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 to prove 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.290
 teacher bow that you have Moscow or 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.950
 you are not there and you just have to embed 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 your skull box think the laws in 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 your country will not allow him that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.600
 make pro fun situation at school 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 this is when the teacher threatens to allow 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 your parents don't know about you but i 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 always treated such situations 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.140
 professional it is important because 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 never afraid of their parents and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.650
 general wants you do not want a chat 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.650
 didn't call 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:47.549
 where I will call Kalina a cup and only 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.979
 the following situation would be simply 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.950
 swift near the board or sit on your 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.020
 desks and simple waste it not finite 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.399
 the lessons 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:05.659
 maybe your brain doesn't feed at all 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:05.659
 no signals about life just sitting 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.769
 school is a topic of conversation on which 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.540
 you can just talk endlessly 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.099
 and yet I will have to finish 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.530
