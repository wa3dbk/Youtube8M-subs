the profit or the coinage 13 a half

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.050 
the profit or the coinage 13 a half
minus<00:03:34.960> 1<00:03:35.230> i<00:03:35.500> made<00:03:36.160> 12<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.580> half<00:03:36.610> k<00:03:36.880> off<00:03:37.030> a

minus 1 i made 12 and a half k off a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.450 
minus 1 i made 12 and a half k off a
profit<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.630> if<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.230> do<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.380> mope<00:03:38.710> like<00:03:38.740> you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
profit and if you do that mope like you

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.310 
profit and if you do that mope like you
know<00:03:39.550> every<00:03:39.760> five<00:03:40.030> minutes<00:03:40.270> stacks<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:41.020> if<00:03:41.200> you

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
know every five minutes stacks up if you

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.780 
know every five minutes stacks up if you
are<00:03:41.650> able<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:42.010> get<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.160> player<00:03:42.400> every<00:03:42.550> five

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
are able to get a player every five

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.170 
are able to get a player every five
minutes<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:44.110> method<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.560> very<00:03:44.740> good<00:03:45.460> you

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
minutes so this method is very good you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.900 
minutes so this method is very good you
know<00:03:46.300> think<00:03:47.050> about<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.350> get<00:03:47.500> ten<00:03:47.680> players<00:03:47.950> and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910

know think about you get ten players and
you<00:03:49.240> get<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:50.230> know<00:03:50.320> ten<00:03:50.530> players<00:03:50.740> let's<00:03:50.980> say

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
you get you know ten players let's say

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.680 
you get you know ten players let's say
in<00:03:51.160> one<00:03:51.340> day<00:03:51.520> it's<00:03:51.880> your<00:03:52.090> snack<00:03:52.300> for<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.480> couple

in one day it's your snack for a couple

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.740 
in one day it's your snack for a couple
hours<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:53.740> that<00:03:53.920> one<00:03:54.130> day<00:03:54.310> 10<00:03:54.580> players<00:03:54.820> x<00:03:55.300> tank

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
a profit that's 100 k just made and then

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.290 
a profit that's 100 k just made and then
or<00:04:02.080> did<00:04:02.200> i<00:04:02.290> say<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.440> right<00:04:02.560> 10<00:04:02.920> k<00:04:03.190> x<00:04:04.030> 10

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
or did i say that right 10 k x 10

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.880 
or did i say that right 10 k x 10
players<00:04:04.660> yeah<00:04:04.900> 100<00:04:05.320> k<00:04:05.440> profit<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:07.890> continue

players yeah 100 k profit so continue

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.190 
players yeah 100 k profit so continue
with<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.130> method<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.760> then<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:11.020> might<00:04:11.170> even

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
with this method and then you might even
