and it can accelerate what we like to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
and it can accelerate what we like to
call<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.480> recovery<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> skins<00:00:22.619> that

because<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.990> concentration<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
because of the concentration and the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.970 
because of the concentration and the

elements we see on that skin surface to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470 
elements we see on that skin surface to
really<00:00:40.590> help<00:00:40.740> make<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> skin<00:00:41.520> firmer<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
really help make that skin firmer and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
really help make that skin firmer and
more<00:00:42.540> youthful<00:00:42.930> looking<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.680> really

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
more youthful looking and really

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.970 
more youthful looking and really
jumpstart<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.820> elasticity<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.560> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
jumpstart that elasticity this is not a

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
machine you use once a year maybe twice

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.770 
machine you use once a year maybe twice
a<00:00:52.920> year<00:00:53.130> up<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.790> four<00:00:54.000> times<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.390> year<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.630> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
a year up to four times a year is that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
a year up to four times a year is that
right<00:00:54.930> yeah<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.560> is<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
right yeah it is about that three to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.830 
right yeah it is about that three to
four<00:00:56.820> times<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.150> year<00:00:57.180> depending<00:00:57.330> on<00:00:57.630> how

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
four times a year depending on how

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
four times a year depending on how
severe<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.290> how<00:00:58.500> much<00:00:58.860> improvement<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.460> want

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
severe or how much improvement you want

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.890 
severe or how much improvement you want
to<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.970> your<00:01:00.090> skin<00:01:00.300> surface<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
to see on your skin surface if you

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.480 
to see on your skin surface if you
really<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> problem<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
really have a problem with the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.380 
really have a problem with the

of<00:01:06.600> hydration<00:01:07.079> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.399> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
of hydration this is really going to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.840 
of hydration this is really going to
help<00:01:08.640> turn<00:01:08.969> around<00:01:09.329> bring<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.850> accelerate

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
help turn around bring back accelerate

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.240 
help turn around bring back accelerate
really<00:01:12.539> help<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> plump<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.350> skin<00:01:13.710> surface

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
really help to plump that skin surface

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.889 
really help to plump that skin surface
so<00:01:14.399> you're<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> look<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.539> and<00:01:15.810> did

the before and after speak volumes you

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.340 
the before and after speak volumes you
start<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.299> those<00:01:18.539> visible<00:01:18.869> results

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
start to see those visible results

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.319 
start to see those visible results
within<00:01:19.530> those<00:01:19.829> 14<00:01:20.340> nights<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.759> simple<00:01:21.179> it's
