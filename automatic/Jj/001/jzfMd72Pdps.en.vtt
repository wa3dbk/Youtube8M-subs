and let's have a look at some other
settings<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.299> I've<00:01:42.390> got<00:01:42.570> storage<00:01:42.990> I've

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
settings so I've got storage I've

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
settings so I've got storage I've
covered<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.220> another<00:01:44.430> video<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.390> we

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
covered this in another video here we

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.399 
covered this in another video here we
can<00:01:45.780> basically<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.890> what's<00:01:47.220> kept<00:01:48.409> within

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
can basically see what's kept within

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.130 
can basically see what's kept within
this<00:01:50.310> text<00:01:50.670> messages<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.899> what's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this text messages and see what's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.399 
this text messages and see what's
deleted<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.180> old<00:01:54.840> messages

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
deleted so as you can see old messages

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
deleted so as you can see old messages
are<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.430> deleted<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.030> once<00:01:57.420> I've<00:01:57.570> hit

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
are going to be deleted so once I've hit

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.260 
are going to be deleted so once I've hit
my<00:01:57.869> four<00:01:58.200> hundred<00:01:58.560> messages

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
my four hundred messages

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
my four hundred messages
then<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.899> oldest<00:02:01.290> message<00:02:01.619> will<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.979> deleted

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
then the oldest message will be deleted

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.330 
then the oldest message will be deleted
and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.969> 401<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.899> second<00:02:04.320> message<00:02:04.649> oldest

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and then 401 the second message oldest

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.639 
and then 401 the second message oldest
message<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.880> deleted<00:02:06.360> etc<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.439> just

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
message will be deleted etc it just

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.219 
message will be deleted etc it just
helps<00:02:07.979> keeping<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> storage<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> absolute

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
helps keeping the storage to a absolute

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.859 
helps keeping the storage to a absolute
minimum

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
minimum

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.440

actually really liking is conversation

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.770 
actually really liking is conversation
theme<00:03:12.129> so<00:03:12.760> when<00:03:12.940> we<00:03:13.060> tap<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.299> we<00:03:13.629> can

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
theme so when we tap that we can

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.360 
theme so when we tap that we can
actually<00:03:14.079> change<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.530> background<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.310> our

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
actually change the background of our

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.159 
actually change the background of our
conversation<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.329> instead<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.569> looking<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:17.109> a

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
conversation so instead of looking at a

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.680 
conversation so instead of looking at a
boring<00:03:17.650> white<00:03:18.310> background<00:03:18.849> we<00:03:19.329> can<00:03:19.359> go<00:03:19.569> ahead

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
boring white background we can go ahead

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.970 
boring white background we can go ahead
and<00:03:19.810> mix<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.169> up<00:03:20.200> actually<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.560> don't<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.829> that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
and mix it up actually I don't like that

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.920 
and mix it up actually I don't like that
looks<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.489> kitchen<00:03:21.849> table<00:03:22.209> but<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.720> like

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
