00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 htc watch at one x 2 I'll show you that 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:17.220
 m9 and the m8 times in comparison with 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 steffen the feria mobile and as I said 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.310
 we have the new htc in the new and here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 the predecessor had wanted in the 8 and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 much has stayed the same 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 is also different to the look 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.429
 Let's have a quick look at the video 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.279
 together , yes, there they are the two 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 htc bonds right of the page rooms m8 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.270
 from the previous year here left the brand new 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 had vonn on 9 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.329
 You can already see it at the front 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.850
 not done too much now 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.399
 maybe a little bit here too 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.469
 think of the grid behind the the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 Our country is sitting at the top 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.710
 new model a little less wide 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.879
 devices 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 this is in the broad of the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 ambient light sensor the camera antique 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 small but otherwise somehow breakdown 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.949
 is equal to the dealers and to the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.110
 display is faster here in the tick 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.820
 likewise, the black bar does not sound 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 quite so pronounced but that is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.270
 actually one becomes only on the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.460
 second look striking 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 actually down here has actually 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 nothing was done both at the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.619
 speaker designs as well as below at 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.840
 the connections htc makes right 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 jack plug next to the usb port and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.070
 right here so exactly back then looks 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.509
 a little different and that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.509
 now have the right version here in 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.869
 gun metal gray and links silverberg from 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.729
 Cinema shows what is very clear 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.140
 Cameraman has now done some things to him 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.909
 there are not any more these two cameras 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.310
 at the new special and the sec me 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.110
 no longer framed 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.939
 otherwise this plastic stand here 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 small strictly as you recognized the dual 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.320
 LED flash and also the positioning 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 of the logo are similar to the logo itself 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 now has not never here 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.030
 but it is just like that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 printed or an elixir here at the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 old looks that a bit 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.280
 out and feel you can feel it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 you can not do it anymore 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.739
 the basic form remains natural 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.670
 just so slightly rounded but by that 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.980
 that we are here now 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.130
 especially in the version in gold and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.700
 Silver have two-tone metal 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.709
 we here 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.840
 These edges are much stronger 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.200
 to remember again clearly present 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.269
 must be like the 0 7 at the first new 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.810
 This has all been a bit rounder 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.489
 and sanded down a bit 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.079
 you can see that too if 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.360
 you look at this edge here that 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.530
 this is included in the display 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.880
 the new device here clearly 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 more prominent it goes on upwards 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.739
 although it is not much thicker one 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.760
 but a little bit 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.280
 Overall, I like both very well 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 the volume button is now 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.170
 now separated no more seesaw as well 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.209
 here the power button is now on the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.299
 page is hiked but stop at the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.639
 Power would be up here 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.200
 otherwise the smartphone is despite 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.880
 remaining the same 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.480
 display diagonal minimal smaller 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.239
 become 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.130
 That's just because the frame 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.850
 has actually been changed minimally 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.220
 a little less wide but can 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.470
 that's a bit millimeter 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.340
 Maybe you ask now too 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.630
 does not really see the first look 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.500
 fast on the legs the performance 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.030
 Differences if we then again 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.730
 if we actually see the money 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.780
 home in the editorial but have that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.769
 should now only with a whole 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.980
 short overview of htc m 8 and 9 im 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:42.090
 design have been both great parts here 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.440
 the two htc evo flagships in 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.639
 visually as now, of course, 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.750
 I liked the taste a bit 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.690
 new actually better with this 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.870
 two-tone the two-tone case 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.430
 again the slope to more clear edge what 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.950
 you like it better that we would like 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.300
 tell in the comments and also 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.710
 otherwise if you liked a video 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.240
 has or does not like to be pure 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.380
 because the thumb up if it you 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.240
 We really liked it 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.950
 always over and otherwise subscribed to ours 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.900
 channel looks over at her mobile de 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.790
 on facebooks of course twitter the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.790
 children played until next time
