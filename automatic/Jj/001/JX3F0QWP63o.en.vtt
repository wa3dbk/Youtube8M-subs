without<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> police<00:02:09.569> coming<00:02:09.959> basically<00:02:10.740> you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
without the police coming basically you

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
without the police coming basically you
could<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.430> Lobby<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.120> would<00:02:12.240> be

sandbox mode which I think would be

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.700 
I think that had been really cool cash
Harry<00:02:44.660> says<00:02:44.930> better<00:02:45.200> character

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
Harry says better character

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.710 
Harry says better character
customization<00:02:46.040> dynamics<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:46.970> muscles<00:02:47.450> have

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
customization dynamics like muscles have

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.990 
customization dynamics like muscles have
piercings<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.560> Plastic<00:02:49.130> Surgeons<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.790> I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
piercings and Plastic Surgeons so I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.430 
piercings and Plastic Surgeons so I
think<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.660> would<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.810> awesome<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.200> be<00:02:51.230> able

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
think that would be awesome to be able

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.130 
think that would be awesome to be able
to<00:02:51.620> open<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.220> gym<00:02:52.460> in<00:02:52.700> GTA<00:02:53.150> 5<00:02:53.420> we<00:02:53.600> have<00:02:53.750> gyms<00:02:53.990> in

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
to open the gym in GTA 5 we have gyms in

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.530 
to open the gym in GTA 5 we have gyms in
GTA<00:02:54.470> 5<00:02:54.740> who<00:02:55.220> just<00:02:55.460> aren't<00:02:55.730> able<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.060> use<00:02:56.360> them

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
GTA 5 who just aren't able to use them

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.820 
GTA 5 who just aren't able to use them
I'd<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.680> was<00:02:57.770> in

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
I'd like it to be like it was in

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.950 
I'd like it to be like it was in
scientist<00:02:58.610> where<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.210> can<00:02:59.360> go<00:02:59.480> into<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> gym

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
scientist where we can go into the gym

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.140 
scientist where we can go into the gym
and<00:03:00.170> build<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.710> our<00:03:00.890> body<00:03:01.190> basically<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.820> think

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
and build of our body basically I think

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.450 
and build of our body basically I think
that'd<00:03:02.240> be<00:03:02.270> cool<00:03:02.630> also<00:03:03.320> how<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:03.920> actually

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
that'd be cool also how we can actually

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.490 
that'd be cool also how we can actually
customize<00:03:04.640> our<00:03:05.030> hair<00:03:05.210> at<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.420> moment<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:06.320> but

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
customize our hair at the moment and but

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.110 
customize our hair at the moment and but
you<00:03:06.590> know<00:03:06.710> more<00:03:07.010> options<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.700> customize<00:03:07.850> a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
you know more options to customize a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.420 
you know more options to customize a
higher<00:03:08.420> maybe<00:03:08.600> coloring<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.350> red<00:03:10.160> hair

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.620 
or something like that
in<00:03:18.620> GTA<00:03:19.250> 5<00:03:19.550> because<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.000> know<00:03:20.210> at<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.450> start

your own music into GTA 5 I think that

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.840 
your own music into GTA 5 I think that
would<00:03:40.250> be<00:03:40.310> awesome

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
would be awesome

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.640 
would be awesome
the<00:03:41.030> music<00:03:41.390> you've<00:03:41.540> got<00:03:41.570> at<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:41.959> moment<00:03:42.110> is

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the music you've got at the moment is

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.290 
the music you've got at the moment is
actually<00:03:42.890> pretty<00:03:43.280> boring<00:03:43.580> so<00:03:43.790> being<00:03:44.060> able<00:03:44.180> to

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
actually pretty boring so being able to

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.510 
actually pretty boring so being able to
use<00:03:44.420> our<00:03:44.660> music<00:03:45.080> would<00:03:45.260> be<00:03:45.290> ace<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.950> also

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
use our music would be ace and also

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.250 
use our music would be ace and also
actually<00:03:46.880> making<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:47.540> other<00:03:47.750> people<00:03:47.870> could

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
actually making it so other people could

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.199 
actually making it so other people could
actually<00:03:48.410> listen<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.459> music<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:50.060> could

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
actually listen to that music you could

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.060 
actually listen to that music you could
go<00:03:50.330> on<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.540> other<00:03:50.630> people's<00:03:51.230> radio<00:03:51.590> stations

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
go on to other people's radio stations

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.979 
go on to other people's radio stations
and<00:03:52.400> actually<00:03:52.790> listen<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.150> their<00:03:53.450> music<00:03:53.630> I

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
and actually listen to their music I

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.720 
and actually listen to their music I
think<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:54.440> would<00:03:54.530> be<00:03:54.590> awesome<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.980> -<00:03:55.520> he

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
think that would be awesome and - he

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.670 
think that would be awesome and - he
said<00:03:56.000> The<00:03:56.150> Hunger<00:03:56.570> Games<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:57.020> if<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.560> had<00:03:57.650> a

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
said The Hunger Games so if we had a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.680 
said The Hunger Games so if we had a
look<00:03:57.860> at<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.190> lobbies<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:58.760> mentioned<00:03:59.209> earlier

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
look at the lobbies I mentioned earlier

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.510 
look at the lobbies I mentioned earlier
for<00:03:59.840> example<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.350> sandbox<00:04:00.860> Lobby<00:04:01.160> or<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
for example the sandbox Lobby or the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.290 
for example the sandbox Lobby or the
zombies<00:04:01.910> Lobby

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
zombies Lobby

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.330 
zombies Lobby
I<00:04:02.330> think<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.170> Hunger<00:04:03.590> Games<00:04:03.620> Lobby<00:04:04.070> could

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
I think the Hunger Games Lobby could

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.760 
I think the Hunger Games Lobby could
also<00:04:04.580> be<00:04:04.970> another<00:04:05.420> one<00:04:05.720> where<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.470> just<00:04:06.620> like

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
also be another one where it's just like

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.020 
also be another one where it's just like
The<00:04:06.890> Hunger<00:04:07.010> Games<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.489> movie<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.850> know<00:04:07.970> you

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
The Hunger Games the movie you know you

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.940 
The Hunger Games the movie you know you
get<00:04:08.270> dropped<00:04:08.540> off<00:04:08.780> somewhere<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.410> they're

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
get dropped off somewhere and they're

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.560 
get dropped off somewhere and they're
basically<00:04:10.340> you're<00:04:10.610> fighting<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.120> your<00:04:11.420> own

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
basically you're fighting for your own

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.120 
basically you're fighting for your own
life<00:04:11.840> again<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.410> think<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.770> would<00:04:12.920> be<00:04:12.980> awesome

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
life again I think that would be awesome

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.910 
life again I think that would be awesome
in<00:04:13.459> GTA<00:04:13.820> 5<00:04:14.090> Lord<00:04:14.750> muna<00:04:15.110> said<00:04:15.380> they<00:04:15.530> should<00:04:15.769> add

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
in GTA 5 Lord muna said they should add

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.159 
in GTA 5 Lord muna said they should add
a<00:04:15.950> ghillie<00:04:16.370> suits<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.880> face<00:04:17.269> camo<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.959> GTA

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
a ghillie suits and face camo in to GTA

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.590 
a ghillie suits and face camo in to GTA
father<00:04:18.680> could<00:04:18.950> tie<00:04:19.130> into<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.519> military<00:04:19.669> DLC

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
father could tie into the military DLC

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.090 
father could tie into the military DLC
so<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.019> think<00:04:21.290> that'll<00:04:21.470> be<00:04:21.500> awesome<00:04:21.650> being<00:04:21.980> able

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
so I think that'll be awesome being able

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.190 
so I think that'll be awesome being able
to<00:04:22.340> wear<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.520> ghillie<00:04:22.880> suit<00:04:23.180> purchase<00:04:24.020> one

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
to wear a ghillie suit purchase one

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.230 
to wear a ghillie suit purchase one

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
taking out the other players I think

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.610

really awesome I don't think you've had
it<00:04:57.600> in<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.960> GTA<00:04:58.229> before<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:59.190> may<00:04:59.490> have<00:04:59.639> been<00:04:59.790> in

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
it in a GTA before it may have been in

San<00:05:00.300> Andreas<00:05:00.449> I'm<00:05:00.990> not<00:05:01.139> too<00:05:01.290> sure<00:05:01.560> if<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.800> can

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
San Andreas I'm not too sure if I can

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.740 
San Andreas I'm not too sure if I can
find<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.280> picture<00:05:02.400> I'll<00:05:02.910> put<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.240> up<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:03.510> screen

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
find a picture I'll put it up on screen

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.750 
find a picture I'll put it up on screen
but<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.440> just<00:05:04.590> looks<00:05:04.770> really<00:05:05.010> awesome<00:05:05.340> this<00:05:05.699> is

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
but it just looks really awesome this is

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.800 
but it just looks really awesome this is
probably<00:05:06.090> one<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.240> my<00:05:06.360> favorite

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
probably one of my favorite

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.200 
probably one of my favorite
customizations<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.280> can<00:05:08.400> put<00:05:08.580> onto<00:05:08.850> any

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
customizations that you can put onto any

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.060 
customizations that you can put onto any
car<00:05:09.510> just<00:05:09.720> simply<00:05:10.080> because<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.350> how<00:05:10.530> nice<00:05:10.800> it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
car just simply because of how nice it

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.860 
car just simply because of how nice it
looks<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.729> doesn't<00:05:11.970> really<00:05:12.180> make<00:05:12.419> your<00:05:12.600> car<00:05:12.840> go

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
looks it doesn't really make your car go

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.990 
looks it doesn't really make your car go
any<00:05:13.050> faster<00:05:13.260> or<00:05:13.830> anything<00:05:14.010> like<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.820> just

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
any faster or anything like that it just

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.240 
any faster or anything like that it just
looks<00:05:15.180> really<00:05:15.570> awesome<00:05:15.930> young<00:05:16.710> inspire<00:05:17.100> have

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
looks really awesome young inspire have

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.950 
looks really awesome young inspire have
said<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.669> new<00:05:17.970> rocket<00:05:18.240> launcher<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.780> could

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
said a new rocket launcher that could

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.830 
said a new rocket launcher that could
lock<00:05:19.169> unto<00:05:19.560> planes<00:05:19.919> cars<00:05:20.340> helicopters<00:05:20.699> etc<00:05:21.690> so

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
lock unto planes cars helicopters etc so

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.360 
lock unto planes cars helicopters etc so
I<00:05:21.870> guess<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:22.380> could<00:05:22.500> say<00:05:22.560> kind<00:05:22.889> of<00:05:23.039> like<00:05:23.190> a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
I guess you could say kind of like a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.670 
I guess you could say kind of like a
javelin<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:24.360> could<00:05:24.539> lock<00:05:24.750> onto<00:05:25.020> vehicles

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
javelin that could lock onto vehicles

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.400 
javelin that could lock onto vehicles
I'm<00:05:25.830> not<00:05:26.070> 100%<00:05:26.610> sure<00:05:26.880> about<00:05:27.030> cars<00:05:27.539> because<00:05:28.229> L

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
I'm not 100% sure about cars because L

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.990 
I'm not 100% sure about cars because L
oh<00:05:28.530> do<00:05:28.590> people<00:05:28.889> always<00:05:29.070> drive<00:05:29.490> them<00:05:29.760> I<00:05:29.940> think

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
oh do people always drive them I think

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.879 
oh do people always drive them I think
that<00:05:30.389> could<00:05:30.600> be<00:05:30.720> pretty<00:05:31.229> if<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.470> powerful

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
that could be pretty if a powerful

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.320 
that could be pretty if a powerful
definitely<00:05:32.280> plays<00:05:32.550> in<00:05:32.760> helicopters

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
definitely plays in helicopters

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.700 
definitely plays in helicopters
something<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.840> could<00:05:33.990> lock<00:05:34.169> onto<00:05:34.410> them

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
something that could lock onto them

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.100 
something that could lock onto them
who's<00:05:35.250> just<00:05:35.460> using<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.820> normal<00:05:36.000> RPG<00:05:36.780> can<00:05:36.960> be

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
who's just using a normal RPG can be

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.140 
who's just using a normal RPG can be
hard<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.410> actually<00:05:37.650> take<00:05:38.039> them<00:05:38.220> out<00:05:38.430> since

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
hard to actually take them out since

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.240 
hard to actually take them out since
they<00:05:39.330> could<00:05:39.479> be<00:05:39.570> so<00:05:39.780> high<00:05:40.050> or<00:05:40.320> but<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:40.800> think<00:05:41.130> if

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
they could be so high or but I think if

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.850 
they could be so high or but I think if
you<00:05:41.400> are<00:05:41.430> using<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:42.330> javelin<00:05:43.050> also<00:05:43.440> flat<00:05:43.680> that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
you are using a javelin also flat that

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.440 
you are using a javelin also flat that
area<00:05:44.250> basically<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.729> rocket<00:05:45.090> launcher<00:05:45.330> that

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
area basically a rocket launcher that

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.750 
area basically a rocket launcher that
can<00:05:45.599> lock<00:05:45.780> onto<00:05:46.050> aircraft<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.860> probably<00:05:47.639> will

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
can lock onto aircraft it probably will

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.279 
can lock onto aircraft it probably will
take<00:05:48.060> about<00:05:48.240> two<00:05:48.539> or<00:05:48.570> three<00:05:48.750> shots<00:05:49.169> to

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
take about two or three shots to

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.290 
take about two or three shots to
actually<00:05:49.650> take<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:50.010> down<00:05:50.160> since<00:05:50.760> it<00:05:50.940> can<00:05:51.090> lock

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
actually take it down since it can lock

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.610 
actually take it down since it can lock
on<00:05:51.510> you're<00:05:51.690> going<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.930> take<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.260> down<00:05:52.380> pretty

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
on you're going to take it down pretty

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.770 
on you're going to take it down pretty
easily<00:05:52.889> if<00:05:53.250> you're<00:05:53.610> using<00:05:53.849> just<00:05:54.180> one<00:05:54.450> shot<00:05:54.720> so

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
easily if you're using just one shot so

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.060 
easily if you're using just one shot so
I<00:05:54.960> definitely<00:05:55.470> think<00:05:55.620> that<00:05:55.770> would<00:05:55.860> be<00:05:55.919> awesome

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
I definitely think that would be awesome

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.190 
I definitely think that would be awesome
although<00:05:56.700> I<00:05:56.849> think<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.330> should<00:05:57.539> take<00:05:57.570> at<00:05:57.990> least

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
although I think it should take at least

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.620 
although I think it should take at least
two<00:05:58.650> shots<00:05:58.919> to<00:05:59.460> actually<00:05:59.820> bring<00:06:00.000> down<00:06:00.030> so

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
two shots to actually bring down so

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.839 
two shots to actually bring down so
that's<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:00.960> for<00:06:01.080> this<00:06:01.139> episode<00:06:01.289> of<00:06:01.620> my<00:06:01.919> GTA<00:06:02.370> Q&amp;A
