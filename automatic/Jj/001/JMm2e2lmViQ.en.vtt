 - Hey, Stosur! How are you? - Very good. 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.720
 - Nice to see you again! - Thank you. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.720
 Where are you going 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 - Roland Garros Stadium. - let's go! 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.800
 I heard that you like movies, TV shows, music, and so on. 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.320
 - I really like watching TV shows. - Which one did you look at recently? 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
 Looking at the American TV series "Revenge." 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 It’s getting messed up now, 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.800
 But I have already seen the end of the third season, and I still read the rest of the episodes. 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.720
 I propose an interview about "wireless connection." 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.240
 What is the last thing you did with your mobile phone this morning? 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.120
 Read the message. Sorry to let you down, I get up very late, so ⋯⋯ 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.360
 What is the most useful mobile app? 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 I sometimes play Candy Smash Legend, but it is not "useful." 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.680
 - What is your favorite song? - I really like the Florence and the Machine band. 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 When it comes to songs, we pick up a friend, he is a DJ. 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 - My name is Adrian. - Hello there. 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.720
 My mission is to record the original music of The Road to Roland Garros. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 All golfers must participate in the event. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.560
 The sound we recorded sounds like ⋯⋯ 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.480
 The bounce of the ball. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.480
 I can't think of the tennis line to make this sound! 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.440
 Before saying "goodbye", let's take a picture of ourselves, Gyomem?
