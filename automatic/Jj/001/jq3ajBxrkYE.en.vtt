hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:01.709> today<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.429> talk

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey guys so today we're going to talk

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.380 
hey guys so today we're going to talk
about<00:00:02.730> bone<00:00:03.419> tissue<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.259> cartilage<00:00:04.620> tissue

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
about bone tissue and cartilage tissue

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.419 
about bone tissue and cartilage tissue
hopefully<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.720> visual<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.589> totally

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
hopefully this visual is totally

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.520 
hopefully this visual is totally
familiar<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.150> because<00:00:09.690> we've<00:00:09.990> been<00:00:10.139> here

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
familiar to you because we've been here

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.339 
familiar to you because we've been here
done<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:12.420> already<00:00:12.780> know<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.019> we've

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
done that and we already know that we've

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.039 
done that and we already know that we've
dealt<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:14.059> connective<00:00:15.059> tissue<00:00:15.360> proper<00:00:15.389> you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
dealt with connective tissue proper you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.880 
dealt with connective tissue proper you
know<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:17.220> connective<00:00:17.880> tissue<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:19.080> tissue

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
know that connective tissue is a tissue

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.210 
know that connective tissue is a tissue
made<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> cells<00:00:21.170> found<00:00:22.170> within<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:23.010> matrix

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
made up of cells found within a matrix

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.480 
made up of cells found within a matrix
of<00:00:23.789> ground<00:00:24.240> substance<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> fibers<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:26.250> talked

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
of ground substance and fibers we talked

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.419 
of ground substance and fibers we talked
about<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.539> normal<00:00:28.349> kinds<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
about all the like normal kinds of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.299 
about all the like normal kinds of
connective<00:00:30.179> tissue<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.859> today<00:00:31.859> we're<00:00:32.219> going

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
connective tissue and today we're going

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.030 
connective tissue and today we're going
to<00:00:32.430> deal<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:32.880> our<00:00:33.149> structural<00:00:33.960> types<00:00:34.680> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to deal with our structural types of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.869 
to deal with our structural types of
connective<00:00:35.850> tissue<00:00:36.230> we<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.350> two<00:00:37.770> main<00:00:38.219> kinds

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
connective tissue we have two main kinds

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
connective tissue we have two main kinds
of<00:00:39.149> structural<00:00:39.660> connective<00:00:40.140> tissue<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of structural connective tissue and that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
of structural connective tissue and that
would<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.550> bone<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.270> cartilage<00:00:42.510> tissue<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
would be bone and cartilage tissue and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.590 
would be bone and cartilage tissue and
we're<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> look<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> different

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
we're going to look at all the different

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.819 
we're going to look at all the different
subsets<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.870> bone<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.200> cartilage<00:00:46.440> tissue

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
subsets of bone and cartilage tissue

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.950 
subsets of bone and cartilage tissue
we're<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> talk<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.450> forms

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
we're going to talk about how it forms

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.029 
we're going to talk about how it forms
how<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.770> grows<00:00:50.190> we'll<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
how it grows we'll do a little bit of

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
how it grows we'll do a little bit of
lab<00:00:53.039> preview<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> look<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
lab preview and and look at some of the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.670 
lab preview and and look at some of the
histology<00:00:56.870> but<00:00:59.120> we're<00:01:00.120> focusing<00:01:00.809> today<00:01:01.020> not

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
histology but we're focusing today not

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.179 
histology but we're focusing today not
on<00:01:01.980> bone<00:01:02.850> organs<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> bones<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
on bone organs or like the bones that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
on bone organs or like the bones that
you<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.909> brain<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.570> hear

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you think of in your brain when you hear

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.070 
you think of in your brain when you hear
the<00:01:07.290> word<00:01:07.439> bone<00:01:08.630> instead<00:01:09.630> we're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the word bone instead we're going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
the word bone instead we're going to
focus<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> tissue<00:01:10.979> itself<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.790> bone

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
focus on the tissue itself now bone

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.249 
focus on the tissue itself now bone
organs<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.290> definitely<00:01:13.920> made<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.270> bone

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
organs are definitely made of bone

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.160 
organs are definitely made of bone
tissue<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.670> bone<00:01:17.850> organs<00:01:18.240> also<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.869> other

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
tissue but bone organs also have other

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.679 
tissue but bone organs also have other
tissues<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.820> next<00:01:21.210> lecture

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
tissues in them in the next lecture

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.910 
tissues in them in the next lecture
we're<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> spend<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> whole<00:01:22.860> time

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
we're going to spend the whole time

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
we're going to spend the whole time
talking<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.729> bone<00:01:24.240> organs<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.500> those

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
talking about bone organs and how those

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
talking about bone organs and how those
things<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:26.430> work<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.840> one

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
things actually work now we have one

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.749 
things actually work now we have one
more<00:01:28.320> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.650> connective<00:01:29.040> tissue<00:01:29.070> before<00:01:29.520> we

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
more kind of connective tissue before we

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.690 
more kind of connective tissue before we
completed<00:01:30.299> our<00:01:30.720> full<00:01:31.170> survey<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.100> connective

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
completed our full survey of connective

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.600 
completed our full survey of connective
tissue<00:01:32.780> land<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.040> our<00:01:35.159> fluid

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
tissue land and that would be our fluid

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.050 
tissue land and that would be our fluid
connective<00:01:35.850> tissue<00:01:36.290> blood<00:01:37.400> blood<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.579> bloody

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
fun however we're not going to do that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
fun however we're not going to do that
