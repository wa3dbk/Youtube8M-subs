00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.550 
chemistry or something because I'm
faking<00:02:13.980> chemistry<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.879> kill<00:02:15.420> me<00:02:15.690> by<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.409> way

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560

once again kill me so we had to have
graphing<00:03:13.670> paper<00:03:13.900> conflic<00:03:14.900> shapes<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:17.180> yeah

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
graphing paper conflic shapes so yeah

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.140 
graphing paper conflic shapes so yeah
then<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.230> got<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:21.310> did<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> get<00:03:22.519> white<00:03:22.820> walls

photography and stuff like that and my
other<00:03:55.010> friend<00:03:55.400> who<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:56.540> creative<00:03:56.900> writing

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
other friend who is in creative writing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.860 
other friend who is in creative writing
and<00:03:57.260> she<00:03:57.650> has<00:03:57.799> like<00:03:57.950> tons<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.610> paper<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.840> I

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and she has like tons of paper so I

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.050 
and she has like tons of paper so I
basically<00:04:00.560> lived<00:04:00.920> off<00:04:01.130> her<00:04:01.310> paper<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.850> whole

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
basically lived off her paper the whole

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.750 
basically lived off her paper the whole
entire<00:04:02.269> year<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:03.200> figured<00:04:03.739> it'd<00:04:04.519> be

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
entire year so I just figured it'd be

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.350 
entire year so I just figured it'd be
nice<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.000> her<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.720> it'd<00:04:05.870> get<00:04:06.019> my

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
nice to her and it'd get my

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.920 
nice to her and it'd get my
