is a rubberband tutorial and an
important<00:00:53.840> part<00:00:54.050> about<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.559> kip-up<00:00:54.890> is<00:00:55.420> you

important part about the kip-up is you
should<00:00:56.600> know<00:00:56.780> keep<00:00:57.080> up<00:00:57.230> using<00:00:57.470> your<00:00:57.590> arms<00:00:57.830> not

it's<00:01:01.460> going<00:01:01.580> to<00:01:01.640> be<00:01:01.699> slowed<00:01:01.970> down<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
it's going to be slowed down in the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.370 
it's going to be slowed down in the
video<00:01:03.229> right<00:01:03.500> here<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:05.799> why<00:01:06.799> power

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.490 

so<00:01:11.380> my<00:01:11.620> arms<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.750> important<00:01:14.140> part<00:01:14.350> was

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
so my arms so the important part was

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.640 
so my arms so the important part was
that<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.920> pushed<00:01:15.580> off<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.540> ground<00:01:16.780> for<00:01:17.080> the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
that I pushed off the ground for the

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.250 
that I pushed off the ground for the
kip-up<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.510> that's<00:01:19.510> essentially<00:01:19.840> what<00:01:20.110> you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
kip-up and that's essentially what you

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.380 
kip-up and that's essentially what you
need<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.590> do<00:01:20.740> also<00:01:21.370> never<00:01:21.550> been<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.620> I<00:01:23.620> know

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
need to do also never been and I know

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870 
need to do also never been and I know
many<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.570> think<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:26.080> when<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.290> do<00:01:26.470> Islam

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
many of you think that when you do Islam

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.340 
many of you think that when you do Islam
your<00:01:27.880> first<00:01:28.120> time<00:01:28.360> rubber<00:01:28.540> bands<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:29.110> you'll

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
your first time rubber bands that you'll

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.310 
your first time rubber bands that you'll
get<00:01:30.310> your<00:01:30.490> neck<00:01:30.700> or<00:01:30.880> something<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.479> you'll

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
get your neck or something and you'll

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:57.070 
get your neck or something and you'll
break<00:01:32.619> your<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.790> body<00:01:34.420> just

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.870 

anyway<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.790> like

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
anyway it's it's not going to be like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.539 
anyway it's it's not going to be like
that<00:01:59.940> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> learn<00:02:00.420> properly<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.549> yeah

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that if you learn properly and yeah

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700 
that if you learn properly and yeah
basically<00:02:03.330> like<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.350> saw<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> beginning

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
basically like you saw in the beginning

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.749 
basically like you saw in the beginning
the<00:02:05.010> video<00:02:05.220> rubberband<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.940> space<00:02:06.180> are

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
the video rubberband in space are

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
the video rubberband in space are
consecutive<00:02:08.759> Kip<00:02:08.970> ups<00:02:09.209> without<00:02:09.690> having<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
consecutive Kip ups without having to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.110 
consecutive Kip ups without having to
roll<00:02:11.370> backwards<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.569> ground<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:14.120> in

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
roll backwards on the ground and in

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.390 
roll backwards on the ground and in
order<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.930> i<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:17.250> recently

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
order to do that I i just recently

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.229 
order to do that I i just recently
thought<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.030> tiny<00:02:18.450> little<00:02:19.850> drill<00:02:20.850> i<00:02:20.880> guess

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
thought of a tiny little drill i guess

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.699 
thought of a tiny little drill i guess
or<00:02:21.480> something<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> work<00:02:22.050> your<00:02:22.200> way<00:02:22.290> up<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
or something to work your way up to it

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.210 
or something to work your way up to it
it's<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.640> Islam<00:02:24.200> rubberband

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's kind of like Islam rubberband

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.140 
it's kind of like Islam rubberband
hybrid<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.400> guess<00:02:26.989> but<00:02:27.989> we<00:02:28.230> wanna<00:02:28.500> learn<00:02:28.680> is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
hybrid I guess but we wanna learn is

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.650 
hybrid I guess but we wanna learn is
keep<00:02:30.150> keep<00:02:30.480> her<00:02:30.630> upper<00:02:30.870> back<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.250> ground

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
keep keep her upper back on the ground

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.150 
keep keep her upper back on the ground
so<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:34.080> when<00:02:34.200> you're<00:02:34.320> doing<00:02:34.530> Kip<00:02:34.739> up<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.070> I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
so like when you're doing Kip up so I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.960 
so like when you're doing Kip up so I
just<00:02:35.370> wash<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.160> see<00:02:38.459> if<00:02:38.519> I<00:02:38.610> landed

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
just wash it like that see if I landed

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.330 
just wash it like that see if I landed
on<00:02:39.030> my<00:02:39.090> legs<00:02:39.330> first<00:02:39.920> well<00:02:40.920> that's<00:02:41.220> an

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
on my legs first well that's an

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.810 
on my legs first well that's an
important<00:02:41.760> part<00:02:41.940> because<00:02:42.480> then<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:43.820> rubber

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
important part because then a rubber

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.699 
important part because then a rubber
band<00:02:45.030> your<00:02:45.840> arms<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.320> hit<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> ground

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
band your arms have to hit the ground

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.770 
band your arms have to hit the ground
before<00:02:47.930> um<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:50.610> laying<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.390> ground<00:02:51.570> up

before um you laying on the ground up
your<00:02:52.080> hands<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.560> defer<00:02:52.769> ground<00:02:52.950> before

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
your hands have to defer ground before

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.729 
your hands have to defer ground before
your<00:02:53.370> body<00:02:53.519> though<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> watch<00:02:56.280> again<00:02:56.580> um<00:02:57.739> my

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
body is it going to land at the same

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.180 
body is it going to land at the same
time<00:03:00.600> like<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.079> same<00:03:01.230> time<00:03:01.440> walls<00:03:01.709> when<00:03:02.160> I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
time like all the same time walls when I

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.300 
time like all the same time walls when I
do<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.850> drill<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.930> legs<00:03:04.170> will<00:03:04.440> hit<00:03:04.590> first<00:03:04.940> so

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
do this drill my legs will hit first so

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.610 
do this drill my legs will hit first so
that<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.890> want<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:12.620> jump

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that so what you want to do now is jump

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.440 
that so what you want to do now is jump
back<00:03:13.799> since<00:03:14.130> your<00:03:14.280> back<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.910> already<00:03:15.239> close<00:03:15.420> to
