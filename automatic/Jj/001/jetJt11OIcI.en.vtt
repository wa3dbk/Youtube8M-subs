00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.620
 So I wanted to try again 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.880
 Commenting on comments like me 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.880
 not at all today 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 Some people are just not ready for you 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:25.140
 kelly comments on comments maybe 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:30.510
 I do another now I want that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 Maybe it is not 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 just completely refreshing videos without 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 content maybe i could be mine 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.010
 but also just maybe 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.399
 answered questions about twitter i want 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.399
 my mobile phone 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.120
 I think that's my last one 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.800
 video because apparently many of them 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 I have touched you many 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 get news and now I know 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.520
 not what should follow 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.799
 I give it all go clear It's So 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.189
 many ask me if I'm after the abi 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.280
 Study or work what I do 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.010
 me just say my everyday consists of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.360
 here and from here 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.280
 I do not do anything professionally at the time and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.830
 I study and I have to say 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 miss the orderly life if you can 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.560
 get up for news and what to do 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.150
 has done and with me it is always 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 so if i work on something i can 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.829
 Lay me as I want and that is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 bad for a person like me 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.729
 I'm just someone who likes to do things 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 and that's why I thought so 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.210
 Maybe I should get out of my home 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.670
 Go out and stay in London for a while 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.479
 and that's how it turned out that I did 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.130
 beginning november to christmas first time 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.689
 Spend my time in london 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.229
 but I will still make videos 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.750
 because I can do it everywhere and me 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.100
 hope a boost in creativity and no 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.229
 make cool videos 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:17.670
 by doing so and not so much can be so good 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:21.840
 draw a such a moment hol times 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.430
 Quick what I tried something 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.560
 I 've always said I did too 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.709
 I had his journal live weeks 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.700
 trying to make a job live 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.690
 But then I have against it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.950
 decided 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.950
 that's how the first page looked like I never had 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.750
 Time 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.480
 This is my mother at birth 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.579
 I 've already said that is a lot 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 my father who initiated it 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.569
 tequila that I was born and that is 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.810
 I as a baby are you this my 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.530
 Body thought that will stay forever 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.530
 Do you know what that is 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.430
 I 'm sunning my teeth, I do not know 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.140
 If I found that thing was immense when I was one 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.890
 baby was and my dad is afraid that it 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.670
 no longer goes away 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.840
 so my drama starts live and that's it 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.750
 life of me and my sister 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.020
 So, you see, I am 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.430
 not very talented i was even in 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.700
 Artistic Gymnastics of the 1100 twelfth grade 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.580

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.130
 abi schwald art I have one 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.360

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.900
 in a super race 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.650
 but that's not what I have 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.650

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:54.300

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:12.790
 pornography employs the good of his 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.070

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:21.730
 I better that way too 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.500
 but well I have it in my confession 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.830
 Somehow where is my cellphone next 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.830
 question 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.700
 many people say we ask questions 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.270
 horns people no longer think one 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.110
 experts unicorn breeding I am but 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.790
 I do not know everything 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.790
 not everyone knows everything 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.790
 well not so many people have straight 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.580
 to ask more questions 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.710
 I might look in later 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.130
 In the meantime I show you mine 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.750
 latest conquests and I believe 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:10.110
 can all assume that there is no 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:11.780
 but books are not panic 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.500
 I was just kneeling 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.080
 first smoking in front of alaska i 'm heard 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.680
 while the john green books through 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.930

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.180
 I have just before the exchange and 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.210
 ludwig in front of alaska i leave it in 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.490
 English and I have to say it reads 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.490
 It's good and it's a good story 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.010
 I should do the booking review myself 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.810
 I'm really good in it and this one from jk 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.370

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.370
 play and this one 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.850
 if you do not know what it is now 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.480
 you know that I'm reading right now and 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.480
 that's cool 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:06.090
 I do not know what to say 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:08.220
 you should be fairy tale cool fairy tales 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.990
 With that , the book love ends me 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:16.670
 look at neighbors grace asks how 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.670
 looks like your perfect day 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.499
 and so was the last question 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.119
 But I 've already caught one for one 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.669
 question video I should pick out you 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:33.589
 just do it now 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.729
 I 'll do it on my laptop 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.360
 saved 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:41.300
 how hard this thing is if someone 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.569
 then I can just break it 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.699
 killed it, and then he is dead 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.499
 the funny thing is the questions are on the 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:53.689
 memory card saved the degree in 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:55.249
 my camera might be there 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.819
 but also already too much of the 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.639
 good 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.399
 ok then we'll see us I believe that 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:04.279
 Next time I'm not English 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:05.839
 lilac the factually fair in the videos 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:07.159
 I did not do that at the beginning because 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:09.770
 I did not even know that I have a video 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:12.979
 I hope it's not too hot 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:19.369
 bad that under start without 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:21.080
 was the end and I try one myself 

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:24.939
 to make important video 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.939
 although I do not make many videos
