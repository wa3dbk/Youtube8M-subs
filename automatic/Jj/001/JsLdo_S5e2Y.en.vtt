00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.859 
like that one too I suppose if it's not
really<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.789> should<00:01:55.029> be<00:01:55.149> in<00:01:55.240> my<00:01:55.359> video<00:01:55.509> about

really it should be in my video about
and<00:01:56.170> bath<00:01:56.889> sets<00:01:57.219> but<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.819> worked<00:01:58.090> its<00:01:58.329> way<00:01:58.450> in

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
and bath sets but it worked its way in

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.230 
and bath sets but it worked its way in
here<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:58.840> because<00:01:59.169> its<00:01:59.709> rituals<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.759> it

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240
