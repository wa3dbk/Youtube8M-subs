00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.160
 we are going to teach you to identify what 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.189
 It's an Iberian acorn - fed ham 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 but before explaining we have to 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.340
 fix let's explain how to identify 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 an Iberian ham to dry indiscriminately 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.680
 that is an Iberian ham of acorn to a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.989
 Iberian ham of steel which we have 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.870
 that fix in four things the first 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:37.829
 is the neighbor the Iberian ham has the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.840
 black hoof there are Iberian hams that do not 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 they have the black hoof but the immense 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.830
 most so the so then the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 first thing that we have to fix 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.690
 is that the person is black the second 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 thing that we have to fix is ​​in the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 we have to find a ham that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.370
 have the very fine cane 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 The thinner the ham has 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.550
 well much much better the third thing to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 what we have to fix that is the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 cut in the cut is not worth all 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.009
 Iberian hams have the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.049
 characteristic cut cut cloud no 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.560
 they have bark they just have the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.780
 grease 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.119
 this is the third one with which we 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.649
 we have to fix and in the fourth thing in 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.049
 the one that we have to fix this is a 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.479
 The longest possible ham is worth the 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.390
 Iberian hams are very long they are 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.700
 they are very stylized then these are 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.530
 the four things in which we have 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.289
 what to set to identify what is a 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.060
 Iberian ham to dry Iberian ham in 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.460
 distinctly that is as we have said 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 the doctor of the bait or iberico of icca 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.500
 to identify an Iberian ham from 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.200
 acorn we can fix on three things 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.930
 the first one is on the label 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.590
 on the label if you put Iberian ham 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.329
 acorn we can see that it is a ham and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.789
 acorn - fed Iberian ham 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.289
 manufacturer has put on the label of 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.390
 Iberian ham open we have to 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:08.399
 trust him that we think not the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.989
 Iberian acorn for whatever it is then 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.300
 well the second person that we have 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.849
 what to fix is ​​also on the label 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.000
 on one side there are many manufacturers that 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.560
 what they do is hire companies 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.799
 external certifiers that what they do 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.810
 is to certify that the manufacturer what 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.360
 has made is acorn-fed Iberian ham 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.370
 in this case you can see that this 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 manufacturer has hired one by one 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.380
 external company and certify what 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.990
 This ham is Iberian acorn 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.020
 which is also not the company's 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.780
 certifying so never never 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.690
 fails to identify an Iberian ham ' 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.290
 of diet is that good that the one 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.170
 fat that has in this part is worth nothing 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.190
 on the outside it is bright and that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.300
 also if we try to stick our finger in the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.410
 fat is worth as you see 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.950
 it enters our finger to any place that 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.080
 put the finger 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.040
 we discount the finger we can 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.709
 introduce this is a symptom that the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.319
 ham is Iberian acorn if 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.269
 We tried to do this in a ham 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.760
 Iberian bait we would not get it 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.380
 so then if you do not notice the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.569
 label or the certification company 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.660
 What you can do is try to put the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.150
 finger and if you stick your finger in the fat 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.590
 means that Iberian ham is 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.310
 of wind I also recommend that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.130
 when you go to buy a ham metais 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 the finger if you want to identify if the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.349
 ham that you are buying is the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.349
 acorn true
