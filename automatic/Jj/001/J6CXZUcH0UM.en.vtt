00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello everybody is already done the first 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.900
 video showing the tribe how it is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 I really liked him and I had to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.490
 send the same with the assistance 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.010
 I'm going to make a video here for you guys 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.640
 see how it got a bit what 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 It happened 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.260
 first he came back inside the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.350
 within 30 days 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.529
 not that 30 days is a short term but 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.170
 at least it is within already 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.200
 generates quite satisfactory 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.200
 now the little problems 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.899
 the battery is charging that it was mine 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
 main problem with one that was 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.190
 sent assistance 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.930
 but she believes she is not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.930
 still lasting at 6 o'clock 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.989
 cancel here so what I realized is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.930
 course I'm taking a course 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.409
 visual studio takes about four hours 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.049
 it stays on during the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.540
 four hours of travel four hours three 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.490
 hours and a half when you left early 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.250
 always off and with the brightness 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 at least when it finishes the course yet 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.939
 You are saying that it still has about 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.990
 another hour and an hour and a half 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.049
 drums 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.689
 however during the course interval of the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.460
 explanation moments are many events 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.229
 what is the teacher doing? 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.869
 after a minute idle stopped it 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.909
 off screen imagine if it gets the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.329
 all the time with the screen on it will not 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.310
 achieve six works and even joining 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.170
 4 hours of the course plus an hour and a half 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.070
 that windows talks and ends at 5 o'clock 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.140
 and a half 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.899
 so I guess he will not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 six hours and something else in the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 course is a very light use 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.350
 so I do not compile all the time 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.390
 the programs do not stay the whole time it is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.750
 accessing the web 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.210
 so it's a very light use 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.090
 now the main disappointments 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.410
 first it was formatted 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.430
 I understand that maybe he needs to be 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.120
 formatted then that at least 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.640
 I just hoped becks would let me know simple 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.100
 logic backs up the files but if the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.350
 programs installed there are 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.200
 unpleasant you receive a product with 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.410
 it all in white even more by type 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.150
 problem was the battery 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.980
 I imagine that maybe an exchange of 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.770
 battery does not need to format the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.380
 computer 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.420
 Other thing I do not know if you saw it here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.220
 I was on the screen a quick time. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.570
 start 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.680
 here you can see that it is not 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.120
 Acceleration corruption enabled 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.520
 she turned off this technology 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.620
 allows windows to load more 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.739
 fast the programs he does a cast 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.720
 of programs using hd ssd and every time 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.120
 that I have activate it in any 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.209
 one of the ways he gives me a mistake he goes 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.080
 stay here for a while on a loading screen 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.080
 I do not know if I'll enter either. 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:25.180
 I think this time not even entered the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.760
 following're carrying it there is this 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.940
 even for a while, still an error that I 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.190
 I realized when they put 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.049
 apparently there was an exchange of hdl or 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.910
 formatting but I'm 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.920
 thinking it was an exchange 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.519
 maybe because he had given that problem 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:49.239
 of the boss I had reported in the 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.410
 previous video in video comments 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.690
 previous 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.500
 and then maybe they had to change the HD 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.560
 so the formatting but the raid was not 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.260
 mounted with this radius problem does not 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.440
 has been mounted or has not been mounted 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.870
 correctly because when I go there oo 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.459
 Main hd is out of the raid I'll te 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.810
 show ships as soon as it's over 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.810
 that liberal my access 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.130
 just waiting for the error message is a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.970
 raid not being mounted what he does 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.570
 it simply does not let the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.310
 the unknown error occurred in the operation 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.660
 it was not possible to complete the operation of the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:40.340
 I came back a little more than the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:48.710
 normal a little help in the very help is 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:51.770
 A problem for my son here is going to be 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.460
 Here I'm going to shoot him just to see 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.320
 as there is in the radio display am to 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.680
 use the fast start you need this 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.530
 mounted on one of the things that 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.840
 come back on it perfectly working it 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.600
 there came no brand the union comes 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.660
 perfect physical condition despite the box 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.180
 have come rather crushed but box 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.080
 for that very reason it had an impact on the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:23.510
 place of the equipment plus one week already 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.970
 I got it with him up here. 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.370
 shortcut 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.200
 with that his performance and I know the cash 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.030
 did not get so good voluntarily 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.910
 realize that some things he has 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:43.100
 delayed a bit more outdated one 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:49.580
 Cute movie here I can 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:52.210
 see that 500gb hd outside the x-ray 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:58.360
 I do not remember if it will be necessary to 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:00.669
 quick start activation is off and hd 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.660
 ssd 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:09.770
 apparently its function is activated 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:12.650
 she is an active raid extracted in the 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.250
 first daycare on Monday the 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.110
 status ac / dc bon in the second part are if 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.580
 I 'm not mistaken, this status becomes venable. 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.889
 normal or do not remember how it was 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.289
 but every time I tried to access 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.090
 the acceleration option that here he 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:35.419
 should also be active 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:37.699
 it gives me that here there is the discussion 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.710
 volumes to show accelerated to 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:43.340
 show no it is not active 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.029
 or simply taking or intends 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.379
 to change the other options here 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:51.110
 I'll probably have to ride the raid. 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.939
 again and mounting a raid requires one more 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.139
 formatting I'm going to study a little bit like 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.029
 stay this 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.159
 I do not know if it's worth another 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.900
 kind of becks to solve this 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.650
 a problem that is not as serious as 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:06.469
 battery problem that can solve 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:11.750
 by itself maybe installing windows 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:13.520
 doing raid but it's not cool you have 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.710
 to do this when you sent a 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.430
 least one operating system 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:22.759
 running a battery problem is 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.349
 you can see it here in the video at least 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.300
 imagine I did not calculate yet I did not do the 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:29.479
 accounts but it's taking longer 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:34.089
 to boot probably on account 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.089
 This cash is disabled. 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.770
 Let's see if it 's right here. 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:51.770
 I not think it was was was well but 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:53.690
 continues a good or working machine 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.400
 For now this is your knowledge of 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.110
 any news or post a video I can 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.540
 comment I'll leave this video 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.890
 link there on the link to this video there in the 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.800
 my previous video 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.840
 Good people, thanks for watching. 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.180
 anyone who has interested in quebec 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.750
 to get a sense that the equipment is 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.040
 good and the tour was not quite what I 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.710
 I was waiting 

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.160
 where we thank you so much Tchetcha 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.160
 more
