00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.240
 and there personal everything beauty almost got 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.309
 educate you more than I show you right 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 bringing another video of black ops 2 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.790
 Now I started the video marathon. 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.830
 OK 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.640
 and this time use in the same stretch of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 gameplay 11 in tha previous video but is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 I think if this were to dawn 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 I do not know, but that's it, I'll go 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 show you is that and that for the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 bus all the pieces is not how it is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.750
 goes all the pieces means that it should 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.329
 that the first place that can be 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.149
 but this piece is for putting on the bus 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.910
 It's in the next room in Japan only then you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.710
 pick up your power generator puts it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 professional in front of the door and you 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.660
 You will see if you will find or not okay 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 if you were going to the bus and I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 I'll show you the next place where you can 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 being in another place where you can be 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.879
 the piece is where it was not who 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 door and then you went the generator will not 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.680
 open the door and you see the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.680
 Our first piece or not 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.020
 it's not just us for the bus is 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.360
 put the piece is my new show 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.450
 work is great but you will see the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.030
 simple page where the one who jumps and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 put hold square and does not appear 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.920
 the option to place the piece myself 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 it took a little while to find out if the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 I had to do this I thought that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.729
 it was only when I did not give up 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.470
 but not only do you do this and close the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.680
 door and go to the next place the first 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.860
 immediately after the first stop of the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 support or the gas station now 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.630
 the next one is in the next one the next 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 stop at the farm 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.649
 so we'll get the generator 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.579
 new so it is important to open the door 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.340
 There they will pick up the front of the bus 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.619
 You do not presume to enter by the 6th 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 its part the year and a half that will crush 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.510
 I watched them and it will be very cool 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.820
 so I'll give you some 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.200
 this time who wants to fall may not be 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.030
 of course not 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.980
 can be in another place as the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.740
 first place I showed you could 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.320
 if the next one is in the city is 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.000
 two stops after the farm is then 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.760
 To get off the bus, just do this. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.130
 It's easier, and we're running. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.350
 in here not not over here did not stop the end of 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.720
 back back it okay 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.810
 we will do the same thing there take 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.570
 the generator on the door that has the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.360
 itautec the bridge where I pointed it 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.510
 we do it right by remembering that 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.450
 you are completing all the ports of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.780
 all objects on the bus here you have 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.600
 a trophy is the bus of hell sealed 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.760
 I do not know how the trophy name but 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.130
 and I already got gum so I did not 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.010
 I'll get it again, he vomited 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.890
 Because I want to leave early, I want to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.500
 I'm going to have to give him a run 40 more. 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.950
 right in front and already shows how it is today 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.020
 put that piece ready now 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.420
 We gave whole cycle is returned to 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.630
 pressure, I do not even believe it or 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.880
 I hope you will stop stopping there 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.700
 people put on the side of the bus was 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.860
 There it is complete it will appear that it has the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 trophy on top not mine is because my 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.760
 I already got the trophy but at last it is 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.190
 tomorrow will be more nÃ© today depending 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.250
 how many watched or when 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.890

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.940

 monsters
