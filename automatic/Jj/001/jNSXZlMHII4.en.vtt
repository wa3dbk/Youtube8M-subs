00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
won't get dry wind correct

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719 
won't get dry wind correct
nice<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.530> heavy<00:01:55.740> feeders<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.340> organic

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
nice they are heavy feeders on organic

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.980 
nice they are heavy feeders on organic
material<00:01:57.179> so<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.420> imperative<00:01:57.749> for

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
material so it's imperative for

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
material so it's imperative for
lightsheet<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:59.249> they<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.999> lot<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> mulch

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
lightsheet that they have a lot of mulch

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.760 
lightsheet that they have a lot of mulch
a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.439> compost<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.250> living<00:02:02.819> soil<00:02:03.259> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.469> am

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
a lot of compost a living soil if I am

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
a lot of compost a living soil if I am
going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.069> be<00:02:05.159> mulching<00:02:05.579> my<00:02:05.909> light<00:02:06.090> eater<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
also be going in compost that I'm back

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.960 
also be going in compost that I'm back
on<00:02:09.810> site<00:02:10.140> yeah<00:02:10.679> while<00:02:10.979> definitely<00:02:11.640> how<00:02:11.849> would

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
on site yeah while definitely how would

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.240 
on site yeah while definitely how would
you<00:02:12.060> apply<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.360> compost<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.170> tree<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.739> few

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
you apply the compost to the tree a few

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.500 
you apply the compost to the tree a few
times<00:02:14.459> throughout<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.849> year<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.239> add<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
times throughout the year I would add a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.350 
times throughout the year I would add a
few<00:02:15.900> shovelfuls<00:02:16.440> okay<00:02:17.310> into<00:02:17.580> well<00:02:17.790> around<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
few shovelfuls okay into well around the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.449 
few shovelfuls okay into well around the
tree<00:02:18.599> just<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:18.989> top<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.379> box<00:02:19.470> correct<00:02:19.920> kind

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
tree just on top of the box correct kind

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.740 
tree just on top of the box correct kind
of<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.730> water<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.209> yes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
of just water it in yes

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
hands on that's what these trees will

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.369 
hands on that's what these trees will
require<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> little<00:02:36.090> luck<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.750> little
