00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.470
 the fact that in 2015, the year 14 15 refused 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.200
 from using motorcycle stickers 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.570

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.360
 that the stickers didn't hold on them somehow 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.479

 We meet Luntik as he is in a cartoon 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.020
 I was not born here at last he was born 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780
 imprint on the tum and let's all 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.490

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 marking them in Russian 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.350

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.070

 our delicious chocolate is not a series not 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.340
 series 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:56.480

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.840
 we came across and this is our sprint series 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.450
 as I call them with slats special 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.200
 such flash drives special rezinochki in 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.780
 complete 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.700
 I remember I wrote in the comments as 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.159
 I use these cars now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.040
 I'll show you first what we do with 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.049
 rezinochkoy remove it so she flag 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.209
 usually pinned somewhere on the checkbox 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:22.209
 they are so packed we assemble a typewriter 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.620
 we stretch it over here rezinochku 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.439

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:40.549
 somewhere the sticker should still be yes here I am 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:44.299
 missed stickers let's stick them even 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.159
 stickers do not hold at all but not the essence 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.949
 Here's a machine we get with 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.650
 With such stickers, we are like this 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:54.889
 check the box here and see what 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.400

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:01.329
 block and he went on rolled 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.159
 our machine let's put it in place and 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.829
 held 5 in combat status 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.349
 if you are planning to keep this toy 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.409
 then remove the rubber band and put it on the box 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.019
 like this so that it does not stretch 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.820
 once again you can wear it like this and back 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.060
 click on this one 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.250

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.290
 because it glitters and it is going to 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.300

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.670
