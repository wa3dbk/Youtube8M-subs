00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 and good to everyone here in the community 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.819
 commenting and today we bring you the first 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.319
 channel guide pvp yes sir we are going to 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.019
 start with our armor and then 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.539
 we will go to the sword 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.250
 let's do everything quickly so that 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.959
 you get bored so we have here the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.730
 best enchantments of our helmet 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.730
 that are going to be the three rupture 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.439
 thorns three and protection four for 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.090
 all those who think that protection 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.329
 against him was better protection against 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.969
 projectiles I'm sure that when 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.980
 I tried protection 4 it's going to be the best me 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.419
 I advise you first in cartes the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 books are worth a song and the armor 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.190
 because then you can get crap out of 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.660
 enchantments so you sing books and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.140
 then join them to the armor with the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.840
 anvil that is not much experience either 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.920
 then we have what the peto is worth going to 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.199
 be the same the same pants and in 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.140
 the boots we are going to add feather fall 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.820
 4 OK, this is for falls, just in case 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.350
 they hit with a sword to push them 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.010
 They throw very far that you hurt us 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.260
 fall or if you fall into a pit worth that's 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 very very important and here we have 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.350
 our sword is worth we are going to join it to 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.450
 igneous aspect 2 is worth much better 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.399
 what aspect and not one because the duration 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.560
 of fire increases then sharpness 4 yy 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.330
 breakage 3 here I have the book of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.780
 Sharpness 5 I'm going to show you how 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.119
 get it since it will not go to us 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.610
 love the sword is a bitch but 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.710
 good is what we have so we go to 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.740
 anvil and I teach you how to get it 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.300
 now we see god we are already 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.640
 back guys we are already in our 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.560
 anvil with our four books of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.110
 sharpness 3 is worth and four swords of 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.850
 diamond this I only recommend it worth if 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.380
 You have a lot of diamond and if you have spare 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.190
 a lot of experience because if it's not a 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 foolishness pass of sharpness 45 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.490
 so if you have spare, I recommend that you 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.440
 do because you are going to notice the difference 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.790
 has a much stronger sword 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.130
 acuity 5214 to get this what fat 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.230
 the fastest is to join our sword 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 our book is worth 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.290
 and we're going to collect all the swords 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.290
 to our sharpness 3 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.250
 and when we have all together we are going to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.140
 start joining two swords together 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.620
 sharpness 3 with sharpness 3 and we get 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.200
 sharpness 4 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 and we have a 10 to 4 and the last two 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 swords sharpness 5 already have it here is worth 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.030
 the diamonds 7 attack damage as well 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.549
 that with the sharpness 5 I think it added 3 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.409
 of damage this is say 10 and how can you 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.459
 As you can see, it's not much 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.180
 experience I think I've spent 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.340
 around 60 or so and you deserve the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.349
 sorry then up to the m3 aspect and I 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.019
 hey I broke skill and it's the cane 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.459
 sword are you going to be the best on the server 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.680
 and good guys here the guide has finished 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.120
 has been a very very fast and very 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.480
 very short I hope you liked it 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.480
