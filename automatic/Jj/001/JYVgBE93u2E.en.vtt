00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
don't generate as fast in my opinion

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
don't generate as fast in my opinion
anyways<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:40.270> we're<00:02:40.540> going<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.780> build<00:02:41.080> some

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.250 

okay<00:05:06.790> so<00:05:06.850> there's<00:05:07.240> something<00:05:07.630> wrong<00:05:07.870> with<00:05:08.110> the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
okay so there's something wrong with the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.070 
okay so there's something wrong with the
icon<00:05:08.860> um<00:05:09.190> this<00:05:10.180> one<00:05:10.540> is<00:05:10.780> not<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.830> flame<00:05:12.250> dragon

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
icon um this one is not the flame dragon

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.050 
icon um this one is not the flame dragon
but<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.380> don't<00:05:14.740> know<00:05:14.830> why's<00:05:15.040> popping<00:05:15.460> up<00:05:15.580> but<00:05:15.910> if

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
but I don't know why's popping up but if

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.210 
but I don't know why's popping up but if
we<00:05:16.300> look<00:05:16.600> at<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.930> flame<00:05:17.260> do<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:18.010> see<00:05:18.190> a

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
we look at the flame do we see a

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.580 
we look at the flame do we see a
difference<00:05:18.820> here<00:05:19.060> right<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.600> mean<00:05:20.020> it's<00:05:20.290> much

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
difference here right I mean it's much

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.030 
difference here right I mean it's much
more<00:05:21.090> vibrant<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.210> kind<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.720> realistic<00:05:23.410> now

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
more vibrant and kind of realistic now

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.830 
more vibrant and kind of realistic now
let's<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:24.460> back<00:05:24.729> to<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:27.070> dragon<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.880> think

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
let's go back to the this dragon I think

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.100 
let's go back to the this dragon I think
the<00:05:29.290> fire<00:05:29.919> was<00:05:29.950> actually<00:05:30.700> like<00:05:30.850> this<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.479> not

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
the fire was actually like this and not

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.100 
the fire was actually like this and not
like<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:33.270> but<00:05:34.270> that's<00:05:34.419> just<00:05:34.660> something<00:05:34.930> I

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
like that but that's just something I

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.710 
like that but that's just something I
wanted<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.440> point<00:05:35.590> out<00:05:35.770> anyways<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.450> is

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
wanted to point out anyways so that is

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.330 
wanted to point out anyways so that is
how<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:37.960> get<00:05:38.229> a<00:05:38.260> lot<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.500> food<00:05:38.770> first<00:05:39.160> you

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
how you get a lot of food first you

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.060 
how you get a lot of food first you
collect<00:05:39.640> a<00:05:39.760> lot<00:05:39.970> of<00:05:40.000> money<00:05:40.419> or<00:05:41.410> a<00:05:41.470> lot<00:05:41.650> of<00:05:41.770> gold
