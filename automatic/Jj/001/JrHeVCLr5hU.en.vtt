cool so basically you guys have the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
cool so basically you guys have the
options<00:01:28.560> six<00:01:28.979> options<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.790> drag<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.420> button

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
options six options to drag this button

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
options six options to drag this button
to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.350> different<00:01:31.979> icons<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> screen<00:01:32.729> and

to the different icons on the screen and
it's<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.930> much<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.500> guess<00:01:34.680> once<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it's pretty much what you guess once you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.300
