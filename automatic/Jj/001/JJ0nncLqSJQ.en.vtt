what I've done in the past again this

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.789 
what I've done in the past again this
was<00:00:11.969> an<00:00:12.630> effort<00:00:12.809> between<00:00:13.110> my<00:00:13.349> friend<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.710> I

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
was an effort between my friend and I

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.849 
was an effort between my friend and I
Mike<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:15.269> chose<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.870> site<00:00:16.080> last<00:00:16.379> year<00:00:16.740> up

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
Mike and we chose this site last year up

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.550 
Mike and we chose this site last year up
in<00:00:16.949> northern<00:00:17.279> Maine<00:00:17.449> we<00:00:18.449> had<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> bust<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
in northern Maine we had a bust on the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.890 
in northern Maine we had a bust on the
site<00:00:19.800> if<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.100> will<00:00:20.279> there's<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.390> site<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.779> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
site if you will there's a site that we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.019 
site if you will there's a site that we
had<00:00:22.020> picked<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.369> found<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.850> there

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
had picked out and we found that there

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.550 
had picked out and we found that there
was<00:00:24.119> another<00:00:24.390> hunter<00:00:24.869> who<00:00:25.019> had<00:00:25.170> set<00:00:25.410> their

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
was another hunter who had set their

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.070 
was another hunter who had set their
bait<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.340> site<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.359> even<00:00:27.539> though<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.900> had

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
bait on that site and even though we had

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.160 
bait on that site and even though we had
rights<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.680> lamb<00:00:28.980> through<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> owner<00:00:29.900> we<00:00:30.900> felt

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
rights to lamb through the owner we felt

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.900 
rights to lamb through the owner we felt
there<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> risk<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.949> maintain<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.610> site

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
there was a risk to maintain that site

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.069 
there was a risk to maintain that site
because<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.390> didn't<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.840> hunter

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
because we didn't know what that hunter

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
because we didn't know what that hunter
would<00:00:34.230> come<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.940> have<00:00:35.940> any<00:00:36.180> particular

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
would come in and have any particular

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
would come in and have any particular
grudges<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.200> whatnot<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> ruined<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> site

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
grudges or whatnot and ruined the site

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
grudges or whatnot and ruined the site
so<00:00:38.579> even<00:00:39.510> though<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.719> kept<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> site

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so even though we kept that site

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500 
so even though we kept that site
somewhat<00:00:40.860> open<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> maintained<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.210> did<00:00:42.390> not

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
somewhat open and maintained we did not

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.810 
somewhat open and maintained we did not
actually<00:00:42.750> hunt<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> particular<00:00:43.649> site<00:00:44.100> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
actually hunt that particular site so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.889 
actually hunt that particular site so
what<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.059> looking<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.539> start<00:00:45.750> is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.510 
and this is the area that we actually
chose<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> bait<00:01:12.150> site<00:01:12.860> again<00:01:13.860> sufficient

into the site securely this is the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.770 
into the site securely this is the
actual<00:01:28.200> bait<00:01:28.409> site<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.659> get

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
actual bait site here and when we get

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.179 
actual bait site here and when we get
ready<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.590> bait<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.950> we're<00:01:32.070> gonna

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
ready to actually bait it we're gonna

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
ready to actually bait it we're gonna
take<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.909> all<00:01:33.240> these<00:01:33.420> ferns<00:01:33.840> because

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
take out all these ferns because

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.730 
take out all these ferns because
shooting<00:01:35.159> from<00:01:35.340> above<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:37.320> pretty<00:01:37.590> much

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
shooting from above will be pretty much

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.130 
shooting from above will be pretty much
prohibitive<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.360> these<00:01:39.479> ferns<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.960> still

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
prohibitive if all these ferns are still

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
prohibitive if all these ferns are still
here<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> bear<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.950> actually<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.700> walk

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
here the bear can actually kind of walk

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
here the bear can actually kind of walk
in<00:01:42.119> underneath<00:01:42.360> them<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.590> becomes<00:01:43.829> very

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
in underneath them and it becomes very

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
in underneath them and it becomes very
difficult<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:45.240> where<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
difficult to see where you're going to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.160 
difficult to see where you're going to
shoot<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.530> these<00:01:47.430> come<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.850> fairly<00:01:48.149> easy<00:01:48.420> but

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
shoot so these come out fairly easy but

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.569 
shoot so these come out fairly easy but
for<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:49.439> we'll<00:01:49.619> leave<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:49.890> intact<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.340> part

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
for now we'll leave them intact as part

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
for now we'll leave them intact as part
of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> nature<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.079> comes<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
of the nature and when it comes time to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.859 
of the nature and when it comes time to
actually<00:01:52.680> bait<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.990> tree<00:01:54.990> stand<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
actually bait will do that tree stand is

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.399 
actually bait will do that tree stand is
looking<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.020> over<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> bait<00:01:58.439> site<00:02:00.409> about

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
looking right over the bait site about

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.090 
looking right over the bait site about

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
down on the bait site and you can

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.350 
down on the bait site and you can
actually<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.979> barrels<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:09.179> last

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
actually see the barrels there from last

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.140 
actually see the barrels there from last
year<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.280> next<00:02:11.489> time<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.000> those

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
year and the next time you see those

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.710 
year and the next time you see those
hopefully<00:02:12.569> they'll<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.780> fully<00:02:13.140> loaded<00:02:13.379> up

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
this with the crib it gives them a very

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
secure setting the bear will climb on

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.500 
secure setting the bear will climb on
top<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.650> around<00:02:44.830> they'll<00:02:45.760> pull<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.330> poke

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
top in and around they'll pull and poke

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
top in and around they'll pull and poke
at<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.720> barrels<00:02:47.170> they'll<00:02:47.920> do<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.190> about

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
at the barrels they'll do just about

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.890 
at the barrels they'll do just about
anything<00:02:48.550> they<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.120> look<00:02:49.330> for<00:02:49.480> more<00:02:49.630> food

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
anything they can to look for more food

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.770 
anything they can to look for more food
so<00:02:50.260> once<00:02:51.250> these<00:02:51.459> barrels<00:02:52.030> get<00:02:52.180> low<00:02:52.390> on<00:02:52.420> food

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
so once these barrels get low on food

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.410 
so once these barrels get low on food
they<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.020> become<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> bit<00:02:53.740> destructive<00:02:54.420> also

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
they do become a bit destructive also

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.910 
they do become a bit destructive also
you<00:02:55.810> can't<00:02:56.050> really<00:02:56.200> see<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:56.830> this

you can see any of those marks they're

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.250 
you can see any of those marks they're
in<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.550> trees<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.480> they<00:03:04.630> climb<00:03:04.840> out<00:03:04.990> quite<00:03:05.230> a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
in the trees but they climb out quite a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500 
in the trees but they climb out quite a
ways<00:03:05.500> they'll<00:03:06.340> also<00:03:06.490> use<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.030> tree<00:03:07.270> as<00:03:07.480> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
ways they'll also use the tree as a

setting up my actual target practice
right<00:03:25.090> by<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.450> bait<00:03:25.690> site<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.260> then<00:03:26.620> I'll<00:03:26.769> go

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
right by the bait site and then I'll go

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.500 
right by the bait site and then I'll go
up<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.250> tree<00:03:27.459> stand<00:03:27.790> here<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> little<00:03:28.360> bit

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
up to the tree stand here a little bit

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.199 
up to the tree stand here a little bit
and<00:03:28.769> take<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.800> few<00:03:30.010> shots<00:03:30.250> from<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.730> tree<00:03:30.940> stand

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
and take a few shots from the tree stand

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.020 
and take a few shots from the tree stand
as<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.440> know<00:03:32.620> when<00:03:33.280> you're<00:03:33.400> shooting<00:03:33.610> up<00:03:33.850> in

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
as you know when you're shooting up in

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.630 
as you know when you're shooting up in
the<00:03:34.060> air<00:03:34.320> at<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.380> sharp<00:03:35.709> angle<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
the air at a sharp angle that the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.820 
the air at a sharp angle that the
geometry<00:03:37.390> if<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.870> will<00:03:38.050> of<00:03:38.260> target<00:03:38.680> practice

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
geometry if you will of target practice

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.979 
geometry if you will of target practice
or<00:03:39.670> target<00:03:40.030> shooting<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.420> much<00:03:40.630> different

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
or target shooting is much different

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.470 
or target shooting is much different
than<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.230> when<00:03:41.380> you're<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.530> flat<00:03:41.620> ground<00:03:42.190> so

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
than that when you're on flat ground so

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.110 
than that when you're on flat ground so
that's<00:03:43.480> what<00:03:43.570> gonna<00:03:43.660> be<00:03:43.780> doing<00:03:43.959> today<00:03:45.120> okay

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
that's what gonna be doing today okay

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120 
that's what gonna be doing today okay
I'm<00:03:46.299> up<00:03:46.420> here<00:03:46.570> in<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> tree<00:03:46.959> stand<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.470> taking

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
I'm up here in the tree stand and taking

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.949 
I'm up here in the tree stand and taking
a<00:03:48.190> few<00:03:48.220> shots<00:03:48.400> there's<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.450> lot<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.750> elements

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
a few shots there's a lot of elements

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.720 
a few shots there's a lot of elements
that<00:03:50.170> play<00:03:50.410> here<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.860> tree<00:03:51.100> swaying<00:03:51.400> back<00:03:51.670> and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
that play here the tree swaying back and

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.320 
that play here the tree swaying back and
forth<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:53.380> light<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.370> amount<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.730> branches

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
forth the light the amount of branches

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.570 
forth the light the amount of branches
in<00:03:55.750> your<00:03:55.900> way<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.769> if<00:03:56.830> you<00:03:56.890> can<00:03:57.040> do<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.489> an

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
in your way so if you can do this in an

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.650 
in your way so if you can do this in an
environment<00:03:58.000> where<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.390> don't<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.570> to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
environment where you don't have to

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.090 
environment where you don't have to
worry<00:03:58.870> about<00:03:58.959> missing<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.470> shot<00:03:59.650> or<00:03:59.799> messing

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
worry about missing the shot or messing

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.100 
worry about missing the shot or messing
up<00:04:00.250> it's<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.760> good<00:04:00.910> chance<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.209> do<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.510> as<00:04:01.959> you

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
up it's a good chance to do that as you

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.630 
up it's a good chance to do that as you
can<00:04:02.290> see<00:04:02.470> my<00:04:02.650> sight

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
can see my sight

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.340 
can see my sight
way<00:04:05.640> up<00:04:05.820> here<00:04:06.030> looks<00:04:06.210> like<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.970> far<00:04:09.350> we're

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
way up here looks like that so far we're

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.130 
way up here looks like that so far we're
on<00:04:10.440> target<00:04:11.150> okay<00:04:12.150> one<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.720> note<00:04:12.900> about

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
on target okay one of the note about

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.800 
on target okay one of the note about
your<00:04:13.580> actual<00:04:14.580> tree<00:04:14.760> stand<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.150> bait<00:04:15.360> side<00:04:15.600> is

you're<00:04:16.620> going<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.800> be<00:04:16.890> getting<00:04:17.040> out<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> tree

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you're going to be getting out a tree

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.610 
you're going to be getting out a tree
when<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:19.459> extremely<00:04:20.459> dark<00:04:21.170> so<00:04:22.170> dark<00:04:22.200> you'd

was<00:04:26.280> taught<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.520> me<00:04:26.700> was<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.870> clear<00:04:28.320> your

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
was taught to me was to clear your

was taught to me was to clear your
pathway<00:04:29.580> out<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:30.330> any<00:04:30.720> branches<00:04:31.400> debris<00:04:32.400> on
