people<00:00:19.430> say<00:00:20.430> otherwise<00:00:23.060> 3432<00:00:24.320> okay<00:00:25.910> 3432

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
people say otherwise 3432 okay 3432

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.290 
people say otherwise 3432 okay 3432
let's<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.349> again<00:00:29.000> now<00:00:30.000> i'm<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
let's do this again now i'm going to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
let's do this again now i'm going to
undervolt<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> i'll<00:00:31.230> show<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:31.859> under

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
undervolt and i'll show you them under

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:57.480

holding

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.760 

so<00:00:58.120> they're<00:00:58.480> my<00:00:58.900> frequencies<00:01:01.290> as<00:01:02.290> you<00:01:02.470> tell

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
so they're my frequencies as you tell

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.030 
so they're my frequencies as you tell
their<00:01:03.100> underwater<00:01:03.430> dump<00:01:03.880> 1.5<00:01:04.870> guy<00:01:05.080> all<00:01:05.890> right

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
