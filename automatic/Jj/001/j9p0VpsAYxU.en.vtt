00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 when this dream and we go now 

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.929
 to talk poetry with claudine 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.970
 his wounds to meet you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.259
 if you create all the objects 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 all the light fixtures that there are around 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 we are exclusively in wood 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.320
 how do you get this 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.719
 magic and many I work 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 on the on the transparency of the wood the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.330
 light and on everything that goes around 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 light like wood that 's this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.510
 of linden tree because to have the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.710
 transparency of the wood of light it is necessary 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 absolutely it's whitewash 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 awesome I'm going out a millimeter 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.859
 finished is there every time it's a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.579
 single piece strong second has always been 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.230
 said and unique 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.719
 yes I still have feet stubborn 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.030
 manufacturing I observe I look I 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.860
 therefore an observation in nature 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 in my garden I do not know what a 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 design from a to z ie its 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.750
 room you really have to think about it but 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.850
 we had to think for them 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.989
 can also follow the customers and that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.719
 the client him when he is going to find himself 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.160
 in front can also manage to manipulate 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.899
 his piece is not class and change 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.719
 the bulbs easily it's a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.969
 second life in your own life that's 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.840
 a continuity continue what I'm 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.980
 I am told that in what 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.480
 about you were nursing years 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.010
 previously before practicing this trade of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 wood turner wood carving 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.790
 yes it is not at all 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.140
 so I went to take in a 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.049
 filming workshop it's still a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.799
 tournament my traditional turner and 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.350
 then I learned the gestures 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.820
 traditional and I convention the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.710
 tradition was not too much my thing 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.630
 so then I worked everything 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.550
 alone I worked ten work of 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.659
 hours at the workshop to get to served 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.820
 piece that I wanted to do 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.590
 by reflecting on the shapes the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.119
 textures the volumes and all that then 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.070
 very slowly in time not that 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.840
 installs and all of a sudden that's it 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.030
 is in this area so this is a 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.340
 personal domain today is what 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.509
 I can say interrupt their work of 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.990
 minutes and ask you to turn off the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.619
 machine 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.390
 at first the first 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.649
 question that comes to mind that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.630
 I count a lot the work of loire 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.759
 I work in black because when I 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.259
 turns luminaries the witness of 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.729
 reference for the little thickness that goes 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.149
 to stay it's the only color 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.770
 the light 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.350
 so when we arrive in tones 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.070
 clear we know that we are at the thickness 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.539
 minimum minimum amount of wood was discussed 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.740
 training learning from 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.119
 different wood turner then after 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.259
 he has the whole notion of investment if 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.489
 you must surround yourself with many 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.050
 machines to realize your different 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.170
 works yes then we have material 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.810
 effective efficient the more we have a job 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.519
 interesting and is also performing a 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.079
 woodturning workshop on wood must 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.930
 actually a wood oven a machine 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.820
 to drink a band saw what it takes 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.530
 for sanding and all portable electro 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.299
 the tools of course we will not forget 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.680
 all the specific lefts that are 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.150
 adapted to our work the tools of 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 digging finally you still have to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.750
 invest in a passion investment 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.650
 for the physical narrative too is it 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.140
 that there are many women who exercise 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.220
 this trade of wood turner can in 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.500
 do we are a little 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.030
 a dozen because there is a 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.540
 compared to the machine I think he who 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.670
 blocks who blocks women in in 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.049
 be here I would say we are a little 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.250
 little about the shell and then after he 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.350
 there is a whole work of finishing for 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.239
 get the result we saw it all at 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.920
 time to jedessine motive 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.120
 and then the limits I help him 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.709
 and therefore limit with strawberries 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.760
 different strawberries and black color 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.019
 this is simply because the cutter 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.579
 heat the wood that then the color 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.720
 black is not interesting because 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.120
 that strawberry are so fast 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.980
 that she burns the wood by cutting it 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.910
 it is another advantage that the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.890
 that it that way well what 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.380
 and it avoids painting becoming 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.180
 impregnate the surfaces that are which 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.560
 are adjoining that if there will not be 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.420
 of effects to see is what we can 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.340
 evoke a little the notion of money a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.020
 piece like the one that it often 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.730
 how much today is enough 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.080
 complicated because we them the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.550
 time goes by and it's so long that 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.980
 if we practice the hourly rate of 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.870
 traditional craftsmen is coming to our 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.560
 price would be really very important yes 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.150
 so finally not necessarily at the real price of 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.830
 his crates but I will see again in 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.630
 your workshop I decide to take this 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.180
 room there you told him how much his 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.730
 indiscretion ben this one for example I 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.620
 will sell it 150 euros it's quite 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.090
 yes it is very affordable upstream of a 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.440
 little piece of poetry the kiss 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.480
 this is very very reasonable 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.560
 in progress thank you very much Peter in all 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.030
 bravo case for the work you 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.370
 perform we will find now 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.720
 two talented women like you and Gael 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.890
 karine including two architects 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.330
 we find them for a new challenge 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.590
 in the topic change should this 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.750
 week to grow 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.650
 a stay and creates at the same time 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.250
 some storage 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.250
 look
