00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.780 
and the great thing about this is if you
don't<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:12.989> what<00:04:13.260> you're<00:04:13.409> done<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:14.370> peel<00:04:14.610> it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
don't like what you're done just peel it

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.939 
don't like what you're done just peel it
all<00:04:15.290> because<00:04:16.290> you're<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.829> be

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
all because you're just going to be

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:26.920 
all because you're just going to be
pushing<00:04:17.280> back<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.630> green<00:04:21.840> stuff

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.070 

so<00:04:27.470> if<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.650> don't<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.550> know<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.600> give<00:04:29.930> it

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
so if you don't you know and and give it

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.689 
so if you don't you know and and give it
give<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.800> end<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:32.090> know<00:04:32.210> you're

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
give it to the end you know you're

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.580

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
because a lot of times I'll look at it

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.350 
because a lot of times I'll look at it
when<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.740> first<00:04:36.979> start<00:04:37.280> pushing<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.270> around

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
when I first start pushing it around

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.830 
when I first start pushing it around
