00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.029
 I brought my art does not have the result that everyone was hoping 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.060
 it's very good that the walls to critics are going to look 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.289
 the reason as if you have no 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.470
 but here it is that a set of things and 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.390
 and I hope it's harder 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 we manage to make good results in Pau 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.980
 to reverse this is for me it's the only solution it's not that I you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.030
 say no it's not true yes it's true it's not going to change anything 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.480
 we're here to win games 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.060
 if we win matches 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 everything will be pink we will all be happy 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 it's the same a lot of changes 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 on the last three games did not score a lot it's changes 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.180
 these three aspects that are of 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.160
 to score goals wishes 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.740
 you have to be in the middle of a conference 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.980
 basically loosening for now 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.180
 honestly there is no miracle solution of luck luck in hand 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.050
 everything is going to be fine with regards to the changes he's had me 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.890
 over the last years 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.750
 he is the problem 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 the problem is there 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.920
 sgcc shares think about the almadies at the c 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.250
 I think that despite what I'm going to tell you what does it mean that there is a 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 problem 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.890
 personally - g 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.140
 hello offensively 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 you think 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.830
 no problem with him 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.720
 the Jews are aware that we are on the ground 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.440
 this conference is 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.080
 I have no points to give him the ball and I know I'm going to 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 to receive in good conditions 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.790
 but that's the only answer I can bring 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 this time it's hard to compare what's happening in club and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 and in more selection and it was an attacker 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.990
 in this system of this device the demand of its public gets away from the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.550
 trust and 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.250
 and that may have made a difference at level 2 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 at the moment of making decisive gestures he is much criticized then 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.009
 in my opinion reported 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
 not answer as a partner 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.109
 I am proud of the players at his side 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.979
 franck lebon selection i hope they will take 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.979
 who will be able to put everyone in agreement I think of an attacker 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.040
 he criticized it's normal it's the rule of the game after not going 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.869
 before 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.239
 in excess 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.529
 and what is beautiful in 37% 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.659
 in one action can return everyone put everyone softly 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.909
 me that's what I know what I want is that 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.799
 as said to like 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.779
 to get a spin 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.159
 we all hope 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.509
 the player is both coach and supporters 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.499
 and after you will see when will we see tomorrow 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.029
 the wonderful that 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.999
 everyone will say that nicolas has stopped the attacker I need
