ultimate travel camera I prefer to think
of<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> more<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.609> perfect<00:00:29.849> point<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
of it more as the perfect point and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.999 
of it more as the perfect point and
shoot<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.109> thing<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.500> camera<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
shoot the thing with this camera is that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.040 
shoot the thing with this camera is that
the<00:00:32.550> standout<00:00:33.149> feature<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.719> notice

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the standout feature that you notice

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.770 
the standout feature that you notice
straightaway<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.980> optical<00:00:35.700> zoom<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.180> 20

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
straightaway is the optical zoom it's 20

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.600 
straightaway is the optical zoom it's 20
times<00:00:37.320> optical<00:00:37.680> zoom<00:00:38.010> which<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.430> phenomenal

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
times optical zoom which is phenomenal

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.389 
times optical zoom which is phenomenal
out<00:00:39.149> now<00:00:39.510> once<00:00:39.719> upon<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> time<00:00:40.230> digital<00:00:41.219> zoom

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
out now once upon a time digital zoom

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.119 
out now once upon a time digital zoom
was<00:00:42.270> thought<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.440> poor<00:00:43.649> causative

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
was thought of as the poor causative

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.100 
was thought of as the poor causative
optical<00:00:44.579> zoom<00:00:44.610> had<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.210> bad<00:00:45.420> rap<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> did

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
optical zoom had a really bad rap it did

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
optical zoom had a really bad rap it did
but<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.129> they've<00:00:47.579> actually<00:00:47.789> done<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
but this one they've actually done a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
but this one they've actually done a
great<00:00:48.300> digital<00:00:48.480> zoom<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.020> well<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.410> they've

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
great digital zoom as well so they've

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.260 
great digital zoom as well so they've
done<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.800> optical<00:00:50.280> zoom<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
done an optical zoom really well that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.580 
done an optical zoom really well that
married<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.140> good<00:00:52.379> digital

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
married it with a really good digital

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
married it with a really good digital
zoom<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> end<00:00:53.489> result<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.600> can

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
zoom and the end result is that you can

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.639 
zoom and the end result is that you can
go<00:00:54.899> really<00:00:55.289> tight<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> long<00:00:56.280> way<00:00:56.940> away<00:00:57.090> on

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
go really tight from a long way away on

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
go really tight from a long way away on
objects<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.829> example<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.510> landmarks<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
objects for example like landmarks and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.549 
objects for example like landmarks and
things<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.530> your

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
things like that when you're on your

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
things like that when you're on your
holidays<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.820> images<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.390> you're

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
holidays and the images that you're

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
holidays and the images that you're
going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> capture<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> fantastic<00:01:05.280> quality

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
going to capture a fantastic quality

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
going to capture a fantastic quality
even<00:01:05.880> doing<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> Charlie<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> can't

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
even doing that and Charlie you can't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
even doing that and Charlie you can't
always<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.950> close<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.909> landmark

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
always get close up to that landmark

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
always get close up to that landmark
that<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> shoot<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.320> need<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that you want to shoot so you need to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
that you want to shoot so you need to
step<00:01:11.070> back<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.610> able<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> take<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> great

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
step back and be able to take that great

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
step back and be able to take that great
shot<00:01:12.960> exactly<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.280> start<00:01:14.549> off

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
shot exactly right so you can start off

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.510 
shot exactly right so you can start off
by<00:01:14.970> taking<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.110> wide<00:01:16.350> shot<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
by taking the the wide shot of the the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
by taking the the wide shot of the the
pyramids<00:01:17.820> or<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> bridge<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.900> something<00:01:18.960> like

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
pyramids or a bridge or something like

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
pyramids or a bridge or something like
that<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.159> zoom<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.729> tight

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that but then you can zoom in on tight

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
that but then you can zoom in on tight
spots<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.350> within<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.950> landmark<00:01:23.340> for

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
spots we are within that landmark for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
spots we are within that landmark for
example<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.509> door<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> pyramid

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
example like the door of the pyramid

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
example like the door of the pyramid
from<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.650> long<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:26.009> away<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> tour<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
from a long way away now the tour that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.149 
from a long way away now the tour that
you're<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> may<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:27.990> give<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> time<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you're on may not give you the time to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
you're on may not give you the time to
go<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> actually<00:01:29.939> stand<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> doorway

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
go up and actually stand at the doorway

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
go up and actually stand at the doorway
of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> pyramid<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.189> both

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of the pyramid so you can get both

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
of the pyramid so you can get both
images<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.290> from<00:01:35.189> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
images that you want to get from this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.950 
images that you want to get from this
one<00:01:35.520> camera<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> good<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
one camera the good thing about this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
one camera the good thing about this
camera<00:01:37.380> though<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.799> feels<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
camera though it feels really good to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.190 
camera though it feels really good to
pick<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> home<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.540> nice<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> light<00:01:39.990> but

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pick up and home to nice and light but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.510 
pick up and home to nice and light but
it's<00:01:40.290> got<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.530> other<00:01:40.619> clever<00:01:40.950> features<00:01:41.369> with

Gita<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> simply<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> idea<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.420> when<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
Gita is simply the idea that when you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
take a photo and you tag the location on

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.209 
take a photo and you tag the location on

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
minutes that that's what you're putting

on the geotag right it's saving on to
that<00:02:04.469> image<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.549> software<00:02:05.850> programs<00:02:06.299> later

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that image so software programs later

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
that image so software programs later
can<00:02:06.810> recall<00:02:07.409> where<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> image<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.369> taken

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
can recall where that image was taken

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.309 
can recall where that image was taken
and<00:02:08.940> plotting<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.989> plan

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and plotting on the plan

and plotting on the plan
where<00:02:10.439> they<00:02:10.530> were<00:02:10.679> taking<00:02:11.150> that's<00:02:12.150> quite

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
where they were taking that's quite

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.369 
where they were taking that's quite
clever<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.689> other<00:02:12.810> thing<00:02:13.019> though<00:02:13.170> with<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
clever the other thing though with the

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.860 
clever the other thing though with the
GPS<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.219> you<00:02:14.639> can<00:02:14.819> actually<00:02:14.849> turn<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.420> camera

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
GPS is you can actually turn the camera

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.369 
GPS is you can actually turn the camera
forward<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:18.030> will<00:02:18.389> point<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
forward and it will point you to

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.830 
forward and it will point you to
different<00:02:19.620> landmarks<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.609> will<00:02:20.969> plot<00:02:21.480> where

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
different landmarks it will plot where

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.080 
different landmarks it will plot where
that<00:02:22.019> location<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.010> screen<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.609> then

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that location is on the screen and then

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.479 
that location is on the screen and then
you<00:02:24.239> follow<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.680> location<00:02:25.889> rather

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
you follow that to that location rather

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.949 
you follow that to that location rather
than<00:02:26.700> using<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:27.120> map<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:27.569> looking<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
than using a map and looking like a

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.410 
than using a map and looking like a
tourist<00:02:28.439> use<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.189> camera<00:02:29.430> look<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
tourist use the camera look like you you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.000 
tourist use the camera look like you you
really<00:02:30.569> know<00:02:30.810> what's<00:02:31.049> going<00:02:31.139> on<00:02:31.409> so<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.889> only

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
really know what's going on so the only

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.319 
really know what's going on so the only
thing<00:02:32.099> he<00:02:32.340> were<00:02:32.430> talking<00:02:32.760> about<00:02:32.879> Charlie<00:02:33.239> is

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
thing he were talking about Charlie is

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.119 
thing he were talking about Charlie is
fast<00:02:33.599> startup<00:02:34.200> good<00:02:34.620> thing<00:02:34.739> about<00:02:34.829> fast

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
fast startup good thing about fast

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.800 
fast startup good thing about fast
startup<00:02:35.519> but<00:02:36.000> something's<00:02:36.389> happening<00:02:36.719> here

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
startup but something's happening here

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.209 
startup but something's happening here
on<00:02:36.870> your<00:02:36.989> holiday<00:02:37.109> and<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.769> know<00:02:37.889> you<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.189> a

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
on your holiday and I know you see a

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.250 
on your holiday and I know you see a
line<00:02:38.639> about<00:02:38.909> to<00:02:39.090> chase<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.329> zebra<00:02:39.780> or<00:02:39.870> something

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
line about to chase a zebra or something

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.589 
line about to chase a zebra or something
faster<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.129> take<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> shot<00:02:41.819> zoom<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.389> take

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
faster I take the shot zoom in take

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.599 
faster I take the shot zoom in take
another<00:02:42.870> shot<00:02:43.109> really<00:02:43.859> good<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.219> that<00:02:44.340> kind

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
another shot really good for that kind

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.209 
another shot really good for that kind
of<00:02:44.700> environment<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:46.200> haven't<00:02:46.500> invested

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
of environment but you haven't invested

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.729 
of environment but you haven't invested
in<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.579> high<00:02:47.819> range<00:02:48.359> dear<00:02:48.719> soul<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.109> hear<00:02:49.379> this<00:02:49.500> is

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
in a high range dear soul I hear this is

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.259 
in a high range dear soul I hear this is
a<00:02:49.799> point<00:02:50.189> to<00:02:50.310> shoot<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:50.699> it's<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:50.909> lot<00:02:51.239> of

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
a point to shoot but it's got a lot of

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.000 
a point to shoot but it's got a lot of
those<00:02:51.480> really<00:02:51.930> good<00:02:52.109> quality<00:02:52.469> features<00:02:52.829> in<00:02:52.919> it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
those really good quality features in it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.649 
those really good quality features in it
so<00:02:53.189> funny<00:02:53.430> enough<00:02:53.639> food<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.090> making<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.449> lot<00:02:54.629> of

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
so funny enough food is making a lot of

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.089 
so funny enough food is making a lot of
noise<00:02:54.870> about<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.230> fact<00:02:55.469> that<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.739> camera

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
noise about the fact that this camera

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.830 
noise about the fact that this camera
doesn't<00:02:56.669> have<00:02:56.849> noise<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.389> it's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> different

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
doesn't have noise but it's a different

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.599 
doesn't have noise but it's a different
type<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.989> noise<00:02:58.199> right<00:02:58.530> no<00:02:58.919> this<00:02:59.159> is<00:02:59.280> image

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
type of noise right no this is image

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.449 
type of noise right no this is image
noise<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.090> when<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.359> take<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.840> photo<00:03:01.169> in<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.919> low

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
noise so when you take a photo in a low

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.319 
noise so when you take a photo in a low
or<00:03:02.669> high<00:03:02.699> light<00:03:03.530> particularly<00:03:04.530> low<00:03:04.769> light

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
or high light particularly low light

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.429 
or high light particularly low light
environment<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.659> sometimes<00:03:07.049> they<00:03:07.169> can<00:03:07.319> turn

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
environment and sometimes they can turn

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.709 
environment and sometimes they can turn
out<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> bit<00:03:07.739> grainy<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.669> noise<00:03:08.879> with

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
out a bit grainy that's the noise with

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.209 
out a bit grainy that's the noise with
this<00:03:09.870> one<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.139> takes<00:03:10.260> really<00:03:10.590> good<00:03:10.680> shots<00:03:11.099> in

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
this one it takes really good shots in

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.619 
this one it takes really good shots in
those<00:03:11.400> kinds<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.790> environment<00:03:12.329> because<00:03:12.480> it's

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
those kinds of environment because it's

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.020 
those kinds of environment because it's
got<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.139> thing<00:03:13.439> called<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.739> EXR<00:03:14.459> sensor

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
got this thing called the EXR sensor

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.149 
got this thing called the EXR sensor
into<00:03:15.479> it<00:03:15.599> it's<00:03:15.750> there<00:03:15.930> their<00:03:16.259> idea<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.889> a

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
into it it's there their idea of a

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.879 
into it it's there their idea of a
really<00:03:17.939> good<00:03:18.150> image<00:03:18.689> sensor<00:03:19.079> takes<00:03:19.530> out<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.739> lot

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
really good image sensor takes out a lot

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.170 
really good image sensor takes out a lot
of<00:03:19.979> that<00:03:20.099> noise<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.609> even<00:03:20.939> though<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.150> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
of that noise so even though it's a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.580 
of that noise so even though it's a
point<00:03:21.419> should<00:03:21.689> take<00:03:22.049> some<00:03:22.199> real<00:03:22.409> good

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
point should take some real good

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.619 
point should take some real good
low-light<00:03:22.799> images<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.759> Charlie<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.209> great

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
low-light images so Charlie a great

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.379 
low-light images so Charlie a great
camera<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.290> moms<00:03:25.590> dads<00:03:26.040> kids<00:03:26.310> travel<00:03:27.239> it's
