gold the mp7 gold
I<00:00:52.020> believe<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> PP<00:00:53.039> 90<00:00:53.460> gold<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.660> just

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I believe off the PP 90 gold and I just

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.099 
I believe off the PP 90 gold and I just
started<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.980> scar-l<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.840> might

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
started using all the scar-l and I might

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.430 
started using all the scar-l and I might
like<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.609> probably<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.879> same<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.149> ACR<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
like it probably the same as ACR if not

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
like it probably the same as ACR if not
more<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.820> super<00:01:03.180> good<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> almost

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
more because it's super good it almost

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
more because it's super good it almost
seems<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> kills<00:01:04.559> faster<00:01:05.010> than<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> CI<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
seems like it kills faster than a CI it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
seems like it kills faster than a CI it
definitely<00:01:06.420> shoots<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.409> less<00:01:07.740> ready<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
definitely shoots at all less ready to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
definitely shoots at all less ready to
fire<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.270> slower<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.080> said<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
fire it's slower but like I said it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
fire it's slower but like I said it
still<00:01:10.680> seem<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> kills<00:01:11.220> faster<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> it's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
still seem that kills faster and it's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
still seem that kills faster and it's
deadly<00:01:12.659> accurate<00:01:13.110> especially<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> burst

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
deadly accurate especially if you burst

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.609 
deadly accurate especially if you burst
for<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.360> almost<00:01:15.479> doesn't<00:01:15.869> even<00:01:16.110> require<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
for it but almost doesn't even require a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.980 
for it but almost doesn't even require a
burst<00:01:16.860> fire<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.520> kick<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.810> game

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
burst fire with kick and in this game

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
burst fire with kick and in this game
play<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> using<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.619> special<00:01:19.979> strike<00:01:20.189> package

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
play it using a special strike package

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
play it using a special strike package
obviously<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> best<00:01:21.479> Strike<00:01:22.020> Fighter

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
obviously that's the best Strike Fighter

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.280 
obviously that's the best Strike Fighter
to<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.820> B's<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:25.110> just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to use when going for my B's and I just

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
to use when going for my B's and I just
wanted<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> freaking<00:01:25.950> little<00:01:26.159> tear<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
wanted a freaking little tear like I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.160 
wanted a freaking little tear like I
said<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> end<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> gameplay

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
said this is the end of the gameplay

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.510 
said this is the end of the gameplay
because<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> first<00:01:28.920> half<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> game

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
because in the first half of the game

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
because in the first half of the game
player<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.479> most<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
player you know first most of the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.800 
player you know first most of the
gameplay<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.040> was<00:01:32.460> doing<00:01:32.729> pretty<00:01:32.759> well<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
gameplay I was doing pretty well but I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
gameplay I was doing pretty well but I
stood<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.290> off<00:01:34.590> any<00:01:34.799> great<00:01:35.100> streak<00:01:35.400> enough<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
stood up off any great streak enough to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
stood up off any great streak enough to
where<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> got<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.420> P<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.380> last<00:01:37.530> few

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
where I got to my P in the last few

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
where I got to my P in the last few
minutes<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.280> pull<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> off<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.689> called<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.350> P

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
minutes I pull it off and I called my P

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.780 
minutes I pull it off and I called my P

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
which I was very surprised about I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160 
which I was very surprised about I
wasn't<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.110> know
