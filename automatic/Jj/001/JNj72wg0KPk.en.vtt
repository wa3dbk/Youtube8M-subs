00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.759 

Oh

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.970 

this<00:00:14.769> year<00:00:15.070> egg<00:00:15.969> drop<00:00:16.480> for<00:00:16.900> mr.<00:00:17.410> max<00:00:17.619> physics

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
this year egg drop for mr. max physics

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.339 
this year egg drop for mr. max physics
classes<00:00:18.250> is<00:00:18.700> called<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.240> egg<00:00:19.450> smash<00:00:19.810> project

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
classes is called the egg smash project

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.429 
classes is called the egg smash project
or<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.590> geekier<00:00:21.279> ride<00:00:21.520> project<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:22.810> decided<00:00:23.320> to

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
or the geekier ride project I decided to

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.019 
or the geekier ride project I decided to
switch<00:00:23.590> it<00:00:23.740> up<00:00:23.800> this<00:00:23.980> year<00:00:24.040> on<00:00:24.430> some<00:00:24.670> students

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
switch it up this year on some students

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.179 
switch it up this year on some students
advice<00:00:25.300> last<00:00:25.599> year<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.110> so<00:00:26.590> they<00:00:26.950> said<00:00:27.160> well

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
advice last year and so they said well

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.189 
advice last year and so they said well
why<00:00:27.430> don't<00:00:27.609> we<00:00:27.760> do<00:00:27.910> something<00:00:28.180> that<00:00:28.930> goes

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
why don't we do something that goes

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.609 
why don't we do something that goes
horizontal<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.430> smashes<00:00:31.119> into<00:00:32.019> a<00:00:32.230> barrier

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
horizontal and smashes into a barrier

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.369 
horizontal and smashes into a barrier
and<00:00:32.830> so<00:00:33.309> this<00:00:33.850> year<00:00:34.030> what<00:00:34.239> I<00:00:34.269> decided<00:00:34.750> to<00:00:35.019> have

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
and so this year what I decided to have

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.350 
and so this year what I decided to have
the<00:00:35.470> students<00:00:35.739> do<00:00:35.890> was<00:00:36.070> was<00:00:36.699> to<00:00:36.850> strap<00:00:37.120> some

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
the students do was was to strap some

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.020 
the students do was was to strap some
eggs<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.840> an<00:00:38.019> a<00:00:38.290> rocket<00:00:38.920> that's<00:00:39.309> a<00:00:39.550> two-liter

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
eggs to an a rocket that's a two-liter

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.049 
eggs to an a rocket that's a two-liter
bottle<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.860> water<00:00:41.860> that's<00:00:42.160> propelled<00:00:42.640> by<00:00:42.879> air

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
bottle of water that's propelled by air

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.810 
bottle of water that's propelled by air
pressure<00:00:43.330> and<00:00:44.080> it<00:00:44.379> goes<00:00:44.559> up<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:44.949> track<00:00:45.220> somewhat

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
pressure and it goes up a track somewhat

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.729 
pressure and it goes up a track somewhat
horizontally<00:00:46.510> into<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.839> rigid<00:00:47.110> barrier<00:00:47.260> and

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
horizontally into a rigid barrier and

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.770 
horizontally into a rigid barrier and
you<00:00:48.220> pump<00:00:48.430> it<00:00:48.610> full<00:00:48.640> of<00:00:48.790> air<00:00:49.089> with<00:00:49.299> a<00:00:49.330> bike<00:00:49.570> pump

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
you pump it full of air with a bike pump

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780 
you pump it full of air with a bike pump
and<00:00:50.019> when<00:00:50.290> that<00:00:50.409> air<00:00:50.589> rushes<00:00:50.979> out<00:00:51.159> it<00:00:51.430> sprays

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
and when that air rushes out it sprays

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.969 
and when that air rushes out it sprays
all<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.120> water<00:00:52.269> out<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.570> back<00:00:52.750> end<00:00:53.019> okay<00:00:53.710> and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
all the water out the back end okay and

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.009 
all the water out the back end okay and
that<00:00:54.370> momentum<00:00:54.850> going<00:00:55.000> one<00:00:55.239> direction<00:00:55.390> causes

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
that momentum going one direction causes

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.119 
that momentum going one direction causes
the<00:00:56.110> momentum<00:00:56.470> of<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.619> rocket<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.949> go<00:00:57.040> the

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
the momentum of the rocket to go the

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.520 
the momentum of the rocket to go the
other<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.239> by<00:00:58.479> putting<00:00:58.629> areas<00:00:59.110> that<00:00:59.350> can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
other and so by putting areas that can

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.689 
other and so by putting areas that can
smash<00:01:00.390> before<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.540> eggs<00:01:01.720> hit<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.170> wall<00:01:02.699> then

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
smash before the eggs hit the wall then

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.369 
smash before the eggs hit the wall then
then<00:01:04.059> you're<00:01:04.239> going<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.420> save<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.869> egg<00:01:05.049> and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
then you're going to save the egg and

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:19.320 
then you're going to save the egg and
exert<00:01:05.770> less<00:01:05.979> forces<00:01:06.430> on<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.580> egg

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.970 

27<00:01:20.330> survives<00:01:20.660> lucky<00:01:21.230> a<00:01:22.090> 25<00:01:23.380> not<00:01:24.380> number<00:01:24.590> 25

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
27 survives lucky a 25 not number 25

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.560 
27 survives lucky a 25 not number 25
anymore<00:01:25.280> are<00:01:26.240> over<00:01:26.660> 25<00:01:27.020> is<00:01:27.200> gone

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.890 

ok

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.170 

ha

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.610 

Oh

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:59.750 

yeah<00:01:47.430> he'll<00:01:47.700> died<00:01:47.970> yeah

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:13.640 

was<00:01:59.850> worse<00:02:00.150> than<00:02:00.420> ours<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:01.800> has<00:02:01.980> horrible

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 

No
