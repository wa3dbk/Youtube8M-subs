00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello my dear, today there are those 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.309
 spoken words pie and important 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.469
 did that I show you now 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.090
 I write all the ingredients to you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 below again in the infobox 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
 Here you see even one more time, and as 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 First of all we beat the eggs 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.380
 on and as well as the biscuit floor 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.689
 really nice and frothy and I have here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.810
 vanilla sugar is taken 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.910
 really good or better 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.210
 you realize that tastes the end to the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.920
 really out and you can of course 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 ground almonds take just like me 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 but you can also do it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 ground hazelnuts 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.559
 So depending on how you like it 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.469
 So what you like to notice and then will 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.840
 the cocoa the baking powder and the flour in 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.899
 two thrusts 1 won and lifted 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 and then, of course, as always 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.789
 Be careful not to use the air 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.390
 out again that is with ground 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.430
 and if we like the sea and the cocoa 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.409
 then we can have underlined 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.810
 his or her communities 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 give almonds as you do not have to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.119
 seven of them are already if you are the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 Milled bought pretty fine and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.710
 when her now even by that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.320
 the skin that is really a lining 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.299
 So I've already tried that and me 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.619
 I really tried that because I did 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.119
 thought human I absolutely want 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.540
 I wanted for my birthday 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.159
 necessarily have more dead and then have 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.880
 I experimented around a bit 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.040
 with the ground 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.049
 the melted butter too 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.189
 stir everything together and so how 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.439
 You do not really have to say that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.979
 seven is enough if you are 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.720
 that's how I do it now I have two 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.729
 small springform so that's now 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.020
 rich here 20 centimeters doesnt do 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.069
 what I have stated for a 26 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.649
 until 28 years before I had to go to day two 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.659
 That's why I make small pies 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.459
 that also distributes two small ones 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.280
 and then I took mascarpone 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.569
 I have two tablespoons to me 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.739
 has stirred a bit soft and then 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.260
 melted couverture did bitter 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.459
 It has a bit of a couverture to it 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:37.040
 stir in two tablespoons butter 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.840
 sugar and have it as it was 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.819
 with the chocolate then because that 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.469
 really that through the melted 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.819
 chocolate is the have very very soft 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.470
 I has found in refrigerator 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.540
 meanwhile the whipped cream 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.420
 pitched and then it is 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.250
 got stuck again and got that 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 have then taken out of the refrigerator, the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.959
 Whipped cream given 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.870
 and then that was a nice consistent one 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.090
 So that you can put on the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.470
 So could spread pie floors you 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.389
 you do not have to worry about that 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.340
 is maybe too soft or something 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.840
 if you are really short in the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.639
 Refrigerator is so beautiful 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.549
 cooled that the beautiful become solid 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:20.479
 is and that we have no problems there 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.489
 that you run that down or something and 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.489
 then I'll give it to my cake bottom 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.190
 and pass that on the second dead one 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.900
 ground on top 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.699
 and then I still have rosettes up 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.000
 sprayed what you can do if you 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.169
 really right j.lo 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.729
 You can taste it 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:50.620
 of course crush and put in this 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:53.389
 mascarpone make his mixture pure 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.489
 what to look for when you do that 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.260
 you can not do it afterwards 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.720
 the syringe because I work the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.459
 Jaunt clogged so either take 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.030
 then you have a little something before 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.010
 to decorate or you have afterwards 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.959
 Really that that does not work 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.579
 I tried that clogs you 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.269
 totally and you do not get any nice 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.269
 Sizes more 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.720
 but that's really it 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.950
 I have to say really delicious 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.280
 So I 'm really a bit 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.290
 tried back and forth and did so three 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.970
 made four gates and relatives 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.220
 Relationship indeed of me 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 he had to keep that up and over again 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.710
 tasted and she was thrilled 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.660
 and said that was delicious 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.770
