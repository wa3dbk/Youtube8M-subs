00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:23.369
 And when it comes to me, it's always popular. But it's not. Nobody knew. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.329
 Because look at coming to see only the expensive ones Kiri and who knows there 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.459
 Did that somehow a little gloomy. So for example, 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.099
 We have to let other kids in the school come to see us. 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:46.079

 It's a bit of a popular band, so it's a good start. 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.580
