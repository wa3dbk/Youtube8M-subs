00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
that it would just take a turn for the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.730 
that it would just take a turn for the
worse<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.090> I'm<00:02:33.090> gonna<00:02:33.390> keep<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.750> until<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.560> see

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740
