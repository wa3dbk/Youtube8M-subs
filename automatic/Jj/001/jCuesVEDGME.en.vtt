00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.470
 greetings and blessings 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.580
 greet you in the wonderful name of Christ Jesus 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 his brother will ute kiel 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.370
 dear brothers, I am going to tell you a case that happened to me a while ago 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.439
 one day a friend of mine died who was not very believer so to speak 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.439
 sometimes I went to mass and other times I still had an angelic culture 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.870
 when he died the evangelical brothers watched over him with many songs and praises 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.749
 and the next day they took him to the cemetery 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.880
 As a friend of mine I wanted to go to the cemetery to pray for him 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 once there 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.990
 I asked the pastor 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.530
 If he let me give him an answer, I said, and the deceased answered me, He was a sheep. 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.140
 our flock and we do not pray to the dead because these 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.000
 heights of nothing serve prayers 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.190
 total that I was not allowed to pray to him and I had to content myself with praying 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.590
 silent 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.610
 this makes me ask 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 we can pray for the deceased 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.060
 Our prayers serve you 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.630
 what is the Catholic doctrine and what is the Evangelical brothers to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.030
 respect 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.040
 as always we go to the bible that says the bible about it 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.010
 it is established that men die only once and then the trial comes 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.910
 Hebrews 9 27 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.960
 after death comes the particular judgment where 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.640
 each receives according to what he did during his mortal life 2nd Corinthians 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 5 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.500
 at the end of the world will take place the universal judgment in which Christ will come in 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 glory and majesty to judge the peoples and nations 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.240
 it is Catholic doctrine that in the particular judgment is intended for each person to 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 one of the three options heaven purgatory hell 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.149
 those who in life have accepted Christ as god and personal savior and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.149
 when we die we are in God's grace we will go to heaven 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.330
 Blessed are the pure in heart 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.580
 says jesus 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.870
 because they will see god 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.580
 matteo 5 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.300
 those of us who have rejected Jesus will go to hell for all eternity 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.570
 those who when dying are not fully purified of their sins will go to 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.040
 purgatory 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.100
 says the word of the Lord 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.029
 nothing impure will enter it 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.399
 that is, in the new Jerusalem 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.729
 apocalypse 21 27 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.729
 you will tell me then why are we in this world 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.550
 we are in this world to know 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.980
 love and serve God and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.019
 through this 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.979
 save our soul 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.759
 we Catholics believe in purgatory 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.649
 according to our Catholic faith the purgatory that place or state by means 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.430
 which one 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.480
 in attention to the merits of Christ 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.049
 the souls of those who have died in the grace of God are publicized 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.049
 but who have not yet fully satisfied for their sins 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 the by lebanon cat is a definite state but temporary 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.849
 there went only those who, when they die, are not fully purified of the 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.999
 impurities of sin since nothing stained can enter the sky 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.559
 sinful 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.799
 therefore according to our faith 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.489
 prayers can be offered 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.879
 sacrifices and masses for the dead so that their souls are political those of their 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.769
 sins and may enter as soon as possible the glory at random of the divine presence 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.930
 some evangelical brothers insist that the word because a torÃ­o is a 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.669
 pure invention of Catholics and that not even this word is in the 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.889
 Bible 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.989
 we tell them that the words incarnation and 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.069
 neither the word trinity and we believe in these mysteries 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.809
 so 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.079
 his argument does not prove anything 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.009
 what happens that some evangelical brothers only admit the bible in 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.959
 change for us Catholics the bible is not the only source of 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.099
 revelation 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.569
 since we have the bible and the tradition 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 nevertheless let us remember the words of Saint Augustine 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.599
 a tear evaporates 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.980
 a rose withers 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.980
 only the prayer of the saints arrives until goodbye 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.659
 the same Jesus says that 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.849
 he who sins against the holy spirit 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.099
 will not reach the forgiveness of his sin in this world or the other 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.649
 Matthew 12 32 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.349
 that clearly reveals that some expiation of sin must have 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.349
 after death and that is what we call purgatory 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.059
 consequently after death there is purgatory and there is purification of 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.579
 the sins 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.079
 says the word 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.959
 the fire will taste the work of each one 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.799
 If your work resists fire 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.789
 will be awarded 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.259
 but if this work turns to ashes 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.080
 he will have to pay 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.860
 he will be saved but like someone who goes through fire 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 1st Corinthians 3 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.990
 only the doctrine and the belief in purgatory explain or clarify this 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.240
 passage 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.940
 we also see that in second of Maccabees 12 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.110
 42 to 46 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.979
 and they prayed the Lord to forgive the sins of the 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.990
 dead companions 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.610
 and if we check in second b timoteo 1 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.029
 1 to 18 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.810
 san pablo says referring to holmes and forum 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.060
 the Lord grant him to reach mercy on that day 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:00.879
 However 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.220
 as in practice 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.740
 When a person dies we do not know if he is saved or condemned 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.870
 we must always pray for the deceased because they may need our 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.749
 sentence 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:14.029
 let us remember that salvation comes by the ce and works 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.520
 in regard to purgatory it must be added that it is not like a second 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.319
 opportunity for the person to establish a straight relationship with God 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.080
 conversion and repentance must occur in this life 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.680
 to finish let me tell you that 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
 Hello for the living and for the deceased is a work of mercy 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.819
 I say goodbye remembering the words of 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.439
 San Agustin 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.750
 God does not send impossible things 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.449
 but 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.220
 when sending 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.189
 teaches you to do how much you can 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:46.509
 since you ask what you can not 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.449
 do what you can that god will do the rest 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.050
 Blessings 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.710
