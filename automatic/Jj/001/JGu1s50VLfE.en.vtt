the city developers from people can fly
is<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.290> real<00:02:01.590> shame<00:02:02.060> obviously<00:02:03.060> they<00:02:03.270> brought

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
is a real shame obviously they brought

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
is a real shame obviously they brought

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
us some pretty damn good games including

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
us some pretty damn good games including
bulletstorm<00:02:06.509> mine<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.869> course<00:02:06.899> gears<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
bulletstorm mine of course gears and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.490 
bulletstorm mine of course gears and
that<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.450> silly<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.929> mention<00:02:10.229> gears

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
that be a bit silly not to mention gears

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.660 
that be a bit silly not to mention gears
when<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:10.770> talking<00:02:11.009> about<00:02:11.099> epic<00:02:11.430> games

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
when you're talking about epic games

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.090

really<00:02:12.000> wouldn't<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.379> have<00:02:13.830> to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
really wouldn't it and I do have to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.120 
really wouldn't it and I do have to
wonder<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.820> will<00:02:14.940> actually<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
wonder if this will actually have a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.100 
wonder if this will actually have a
significant<00:02:17.130> impact<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.510> future<00:02:18.690> games

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
significant impact on the future games

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.770 
significant impact on the future games
in<00:02:19.440> any<00:02:19.890> franchises<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.700> he<00:02:21.180> was<00:02:21.300> working<00:02:21.450> on

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
in any franchises that he was working on

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.660 
in any franchises that he was working on
office<00:02:22.020> he<00:02:22.110> most<00:02:22.500> importantly<00:02:23.340> would<00:02:23.490> be

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
office he most importantly would be

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.940 
office he most importantly would be
gears<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.840> any<00:02:24.990> other<00:02:25.080> future<00:02:25.380> games<00:02:25.770> they

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
gears but any other future games they

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.680 
gears but any other future games they
might<00:02:26.100> be<00:02:26.220> working<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:26.910> well<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.540> would

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
might be working on as well I would

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.630 
might be working on as well I would
imagine<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.320> would<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:29.190> he<00:02:29.430> was<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
imagine that it would because he was a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.450 
imagine that it would because he was a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
pretty high up position his senior

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.040 
pretty high up position his senior
producer<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> would<00:02:33.450> imagine<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.810> his

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
producer so I would imagine that his

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.640 
producer so I would imagine that his
influence<00:02:34.590> well<00:02:35.810> while<00:02:36.810> he<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.170> not<00:02:37.380> the
