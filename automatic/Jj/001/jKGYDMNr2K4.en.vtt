00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.130
 today we are going to prepare a cheese cake 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.810
 baked 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.270
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.760
 are 2 taurines of cheese to spread or the 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.820
 equivalent to 500 grams two yogurts 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.220
 natural two measures of milk yogurt 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 two measures of cream yogurt four 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.090
 four sugar yogurt measurements 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.110
 Flour yogurt measurements one envelope 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.660
 yeast and four eggs 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.090
 we are going to put in a bowl the 2 tubs 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.090
 of cheese spread or 500 grams 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.670
 and we will add the yogurt has to be 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.670
 a natural yogurt 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.970
 it does not matter if it is skimmed with sugar 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.840
 that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.840
 it would be equal 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.540
 we do not add the two regular 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.650
 once we have the huehues in the bowl 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.650
 we will also add the eggs 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.260
 As you can see, this recipe does not need to go 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.170
 beating first one then another what 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.070
 we are going to do is incorporate all the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.550
 ingredients together 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.390
 now we will take a measure of the glass 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.390
 milk 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.340
 and then another 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.010
 now we will take the two measures too 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.140
 of the cream 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.770
 the cream has to be 35 1% 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 fat 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 since cooking is a little bit more 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.920
 liquid 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 now we will add the four measures of 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 sugar 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.710
 it is very important to always put the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.649
 sugar that frames the recipe does not 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.690
 it's good to say I'm going to put you less than me 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 like with less not sugar not only 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.999
 sweetens 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:22.000
 and then we will also throw the envelope of 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:24.970
 yeast and now if we take a blender 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.320
 and we will go beating all very well what 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.140
 we have well beaten we are going to go throwing 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.710
 first let's put two measures of 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.710
 flour 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.190
 and we will beat them very well 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.520
 once we have those two measures well 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.520
 homogeneous we will throw the other two 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.540
 you can in this region have used flour 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.390
 sieved you can sift it if you want or 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.390
 no that is already to your liking 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.950
 and we are going to beat again 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.769
 we are going to beat it very well until 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:21.260
 we were not a single group once 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.819
 we have list let's take a mold 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.010
 I have taken one of these rounds 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:30.110
 detachable and we are going to 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.420
 to decorate it a little bit with 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.420
 with butter so that it does not stick 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.020
 and we will throw all the mixture 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.210
 we will leave 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.550
 and we will put it in the preheated oven 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:51.030
 at about 180 degrees with a minimum of 45 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.430
 minutes or until clicking does not leave 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.430
 the stick almost dry 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.510
 once that time has passed as you can see 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.490
 we have our cake ready we will leave it 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.850
 cool in the mold completely until the 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.860
 time to serve 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.360
 As you can see, these are a recipe 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.690
 simple but at the same time very rich I hope 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.690
 I wish you like it
