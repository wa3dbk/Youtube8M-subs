00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.680
 It is an image seen from directly above 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.850
 This is that this is the ball 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:26.070
 It is a head of a driver and I rude to have a shaft here 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 There is a shaft here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 This is the grip 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.019
 Here 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.120
 There is a body 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.120
 This is a ball 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.250
 This Club Het 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.040
 This is N shaft 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 This is the grip 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.770
 And this is the body 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:01.320
 This is an image of the addressed state viewed from directly above 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.100
 The direction we want to strike is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.100
 Like 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.450
 In what such form and this is made in the ball flying students to the image that there is a target on the extension line 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.289
 Become 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 From the state I was holding at the address as I mentioned earlier 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:29.760
 Do not consciously rotate your arm 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:35.070
 And of going to start the back swing from the movement and the head of the club and grip 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.040
 Because the grip say is go into the inside with the back swing starting 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.320
 I will 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 During backswing 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.700
 It says the club head 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.560
 I will move in this way 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.560
 Also say the grip in the same way 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.100
 I will move in this way 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.789
 In other words, sometimes back from the state in which he set up in the address I go to start the back swing 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:15.750
 Together with the swing of the start-up 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.150
 The head and grip of the club will be an image that enters moderately inside 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.150
 the body's 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 Hmm 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 Center as center 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.300
 Club head and grip 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.379
 It becomes a high draw such an image of salt 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.310
 It will be an image that does not change this distance 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.970
 What 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.560
 From the state of holding by address 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:55.480
 Centered on the raised bones of the base of the neck 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:02.170
 Start backswing from the motion to rotate the face of the chest 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:06.190
 Moderately so as to draw a circle together with the start-up of the head back swing of the grip and the club 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.970
 The image of playing inside will be like this when you backswing 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.550
 Shaft is at a position parallel to the ground than grip 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.060
 Club edition 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.610
 Will come to the back 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.610
 This is the ideal way to play backswing
