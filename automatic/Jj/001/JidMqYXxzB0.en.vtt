did<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> lot<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.839> math<00:00:06.839> classes<00:00:07.140> before<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.620> left

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
did a lot of math classes before I left

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.190 
did a lot of math classes before I left
and<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.790> really<00:00:09.179> really<00:00:09.480> wanted<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.870> get<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and I really really wanted to get to the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.690 
and I really really wanted to get to the
point<00:00:10.380> where<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.590> felt<00:00:10.769> comfortable<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.490> leave

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
point where I felt comfortable to leave

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.020 
point where I felt comfortable to leave
and<00:00:12.019> not<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.380> worry<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.280> didn't<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and not have to worry if I didn't get a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.390 
and not have to worry if I didn't get a
math<00:00:15.389> class<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.900> transfer<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.650> UCSB<00:00:16.980> or

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
math class that transfer to UCSB or

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.670 
math class that transfer to UCSB or
worked<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.789> my<00:00:18.000> curriculum<00:00:18.359> thumb<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.289> also

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
worked with my curriculum thumb I also

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.460 
worked with my curriculum thumb I also
took<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.070> math<00:00:20.220> class<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:21.090> um<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.260> was

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
took a math class was there um it was

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.070 
took a math class was there um it was
because<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> semesters<00:00:23.820> accounted<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.420> 8.5

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
because it semesters accounted for 8.5

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
because it semesters accounted for 8.5
units<00:00:25.439> which<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> ridiculous<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.869> only

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
units which is ridiculous so I was only

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
units which is ridiculous so I was only
able<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.529> take<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.980> math<00:00:29.220> class<00:00:29.490> while<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> was

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
able to take one math class while I was

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.730 
able to take one math class while I was
abroad<00:00:30.000> without<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:31.019> my<00:00:31.170> elective

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
abroad without going over my elective

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.080 
abroad without going over my elective
credits<00:00:32.460> um<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.239> they're<00:00:33.840> very<00:00:33.980> very

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
credits um and they're very very

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.330 
credits um and they're very very

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
understanding that learning abroad is is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 
understanding that learning abroad is is
the<00:00:38.820> challenge<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.480> itself<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.500> they're

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the challenge in itself but they're

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
the challenge in itself but they're
excited<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> found<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
lot of support in all areas for those of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.319 
lot of support in all areas for those of
you<00:00:47.070> who<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.460> can't<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.730> abroad<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
graduate in four years if these

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
graduate in four years if these
petitions<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:50.730> through<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.120> graduating

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
petitions go through and graduating
