neighborhood they're like an English
breed<00:00:51.729> I<00:00:51.760> guess<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:53.079> it<00:00:53.199> might<00:00:53.319> be<00:00:53.379> as<00:00:53.530> old<00:00:53.649> as

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
breed I guess so it might be as old as

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.079 
breed I guess so it might be as old as
these<00:00:53.949> other<00:00:54.100> guys<00:00:54.249> yeah<00:00:54.519> oh<00:00:54.549> yeah<00:00:54.850> tiny

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
these other guys yeah oh yeah tiny

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.099 
these other guys yeah oh yeah tiny
definitely<00:00:55.600> they're<00:00:55.839> just<00:00:56.019> a<00:00:56.079> different

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
definitely they're just a different

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.349 
definitely they're just a different
variety<00:00:56.589> they<00:00:57.339> have<00:00:57.489> made<00:00:57.670> my<00:00:57.819> point

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
variety they have made my point

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.949 
variety they have made my point
is<00:00:58.749> it<00:00:59.139> spelled<00:00:59.469> be<00:00:59.829> righ<00:01:00.760> T<00:01:01.149> or<00:01:01.359> B<00:01:01.389> I<00:01:01.569> think

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
is it spelled be righ T or B I think

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:09.510 
is it spelled be righ T or B I think
it's<00:01:02.079> Bri<00:01:02.409> T<00:01:04.950> so<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:07.500> these<00:01:08.500> are<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.770> ones

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
it's Bri T so this is these are the ones

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.520 
it's Bri T so this is these are the ones
that<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:10.030> will<00:01:10.270> try<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:17.229> caught<00:01:17.439> though
