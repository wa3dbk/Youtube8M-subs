00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.633
The Four Friends

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:20.633
Retold by BookBox

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.300
Far from any town,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.800
there was a forest,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.133
in which all the animals and birds

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:36.883
lived together peacefully.

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:41.133
The forest was home

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.133
to four inseparable friends:

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.300
a deer, a tortoise,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.133
a crow, and a mouse.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.133
Every evening

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.217
they met to discuss

00:00:56.217 --> 00:01:01.133
the events of the day.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.050
But one day,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.800
the deer became very frightened.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.883
“Hunters are laying traps everywhere.

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:13.800
“Hunters are laying traps everywhere.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.133
Is there anything we can do

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.217
to escape?”

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:21.300
“Yes there is,”

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.717
the crow cried out.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.217
“As our friend the mouse knows!”

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:28.550
“As our friend the mouse knows!”

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.967
The crow began telling everyone

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:35.967
what he had seen.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:37.550
“Just the other day,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.633
I saw the most amazing thing.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:43.967
A flock of doves

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:44.883
got trapped in a hunter’s net,

00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:46.800
got trapped in a hunter’s net,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.883
their wings flapping wildly.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.550
Then suddenly, all together,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.467
the doves picked up the net

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:56.217
in their beaks

00:01:56.217 --> 00:02:01.967
and flew into the sky.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.133
And where did they go?

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:12.383
Straight to our friend the mouse!

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:14.383
With his sharp teeth,

00:02:14.383 --> 00:02:19.633
he tore the net to pieces.

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.383
Free at last,

00:02:22.383 --> 00:02:25.883
the doves flew away.

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:27.133
They were very grateful

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:31.800
to our friend.”

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:36.633
After the story ended,

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:37.467
the deer went

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:42.133
in search of water

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:45.383
while the three friends

00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:47.633
started nibbling on the fruits,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:53.300
shrubs and leaves of the forest.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.883
They chatted late into the night,

00:02:56.883 --> 00:03:01.300
still waiting for the deer to return.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:02.300
But the deer was nowhere to be seen,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300
But the deer was nowhere to be seen,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.800
and the friends began to worry.

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:11.967
At dawn,

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:14.717
while the others called out to the deer,

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:16.883
the crow flew in every direction

00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:21.217
looking for her.

00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:24.800
In a clearing, he spotted the deer

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.217
In a clearing, he spotted the deer

00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:31.050
with her foot caught in a net.

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:32.967
“Don’t worry,”

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:35.050
he told her calmly.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.550
“We’ll think of something.”

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.133
The crow rushed back to his friends.

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:51.300
The tortoise had an idea:

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.967
“Mouse, hop quickly

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.883
on the crow’s back.”

00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:58.050
And they flew off to rescue the deer.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.800
And they flew off to rescue the deer.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.217
Without wasting time,

00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:08.967
the mouse bit through the net.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:11.050
Just then, the anxious tortoise

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.050
reached the spot.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.800
“Why did you come here?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.967
If the hunter returns,

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.050
you’ll never escape!”

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.633
the deer exclaimed.

00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:25.550
And the hunter did return!

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.133
And the hunter did return!

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.383
Hearing his footsteps,

00:04:30.383 --> 00:04:34.383
all of them ran away,

00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:38.217
but the tortoise was too slow.

00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:39.800
The hunter picked him up

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.133
and tied him to a stick.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:45.883
“Oh no! Because of me,

00:04:45.883 --> 00:04:48.383
poor Tortoise is in trouble,”

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:50.883
said the deer.

00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:53.467
Suddenly, the deer leaped up

00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:55.467
and ran to the pond

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:59.967
near the path.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.967
She lay down absolutely still,

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:08.883
while the crow pecked at her.

00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:10.967
When the hunter dropped the tortoise

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:12.217
When the hunter dropped the tortoise

00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:13.633
and picked up the deer,

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:16.133
the mouse quickly cut the cords

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:20.383
and released the tortoise.

00:05:20.383 --> 00:05:21.383
While the tortoise

00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:23.133
slipped into the water,

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:25.300
the deer darted off

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.633
and the crow simply flew away.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.633
The hunter trembled with fear.

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:39.300
He had never seen an animal

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.550
come back to life.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.550
Thinking that the forest was haunted,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.883
Thinking that the forest was haunted,

00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:47.133
he ran for his life.

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:52.217
he ran for his life.

00:05:54.717 --> 00:05:56.133
The four friends went home

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:57.717
and were happy to be together again.

00:05:57.717 --> 00:06:02.050
and were happy to be together again.
