00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello youtube under this channel 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 chimpanzee gamer release 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.880
 usually battlefield 3 videos but 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.030
 because I'm the first or one of the first 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'm a nexus 10 in germany 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 I have received a tablet 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.820
 I decided a lot about it 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.960
 short scarce video to make 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.520
 I'm not even concerned about that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 face even if I still 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.750
 Immediately a nexus seven of the first 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.220
 generation and an ipad2 against it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.080
 nevertheless, this is only about mine 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.579
 First impressions what you are now 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.649
 just seen in the video are the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.719
 Both accessories are with the device 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.149
 once came the usb cable and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.370
 Of course, a power adapter with 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.620
 usb connection and that it already that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.719
 device with its connection options 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
 left side lower side and right 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.980
 page how exactly I use that with me 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.480
 will be published later 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 maybe another video here 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.640
 a very short jump over 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 settings or one 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.699
 facing with the old nexus 7 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 that much thicker and different in the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 hand is so you actually believe 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.769
 not that it is the same series 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.840
 feels in my eyes or in 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.630
 my hands a little different 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
 and this is already the ipad 2 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.670
 in white he is a very small one 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 of course higher 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 the nexus is of course a little one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 Pieces longer and the thickness is so 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.390
 From the visual impression, it is almost 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.369
 identical so you do not have to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.689
 on any values 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.329
 since that called the ipad now 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.979
 maybe 1 millimeter thicker or 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.560
 thinner is in some places yes that is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.540
 It does not matter at all 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.070
 The display is switched on from the first one 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.950
 her or from the nature ago 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.960
 with direct viewing absolutely better 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.360
 as of the ipad2 I have, of course 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.829
 no ipad 3 and also no update 4 to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.079
 Compare here compared to the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.729
 two of course it is better but im 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.869
 everyday use I am the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.700
 opinion is worth something at all 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.920
 not to compare with each other so 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 that the display is totally great 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.579
 No question is it stood up to the time 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.229
 date what the technology and so on 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.090
 but I would not anymore 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.240
 Buy this tablet or I have it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.670
 I did not buy it just because I was there 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.080
 the device wanted to have a better display 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.670
 I actually only have myself 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.230
 when we got the next 7 already quite 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.819
 liked 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.769
 the nexus 7 has that short especially 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.090
 has seen the near future's in 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.879
 a contest from xbmc 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.349
 netz.com wants to win there 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.180
 even people in part because namely grabs 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.909
 the link to just here in the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.049
 video description otherwise where we are 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.670
 especially with the pictures are the 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.400
 i have taken a short of the with the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.410
 camera directly from the device the camera 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.040
 itself makes a very good on me 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 impression 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.560
 I still have the galaxy nexus 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.879
 smartphone and so when at the first 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.420
 snapshots would not have done 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.190
 I say 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.950
 the tablet has a clearly better 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.690
 camera the videos you take with it 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.400
 are much better too 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.319
 worse light conditions 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.410
 at least that's how you're all very first 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.959
 impression and in comparison now where i am 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.660
 here just the reader recording to the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.430
 ipad works then the works 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.540
 handover to the other google services 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.500
 or to youtube, for example 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.720
 just a lot better cleaner 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.400
 painless so in the case of the ios 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.810
 landy again or again, or you end up 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.870
 then if you go over the detour now 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.280
 the reader I'm using here 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.470
 if you're on the mobile again 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.079
 page and videos are not loaded 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.419
 or content loads forever and you have that 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.519
 with this integration of the google 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.810
 tablet of course not at all and that 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.400
 is actually the decisive factor 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.650
 Reason why I get this 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.250
 i have installed a few ago 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.169
 meet 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.150
 get these e-mail notifications 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.739
 when the device was available 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.989
 then the same problems as all 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.329
 others also had with the order 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.349
 but not 20 times I want 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.660
 say I want it to be official 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.389
 clicked on but just one 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.370
 some traffic weak time 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.109
 Waited a few minutes and could 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.530
 my order still in the basket 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.900
 was able to finish completely with it 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.730
 I complete the order process and 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.650
 I got the device delivered today 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.329
 I'm sure it's diving today and 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.910
 some more in the course of the next few days 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.790
 Videos on the new devices on the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.530
 first impression of the nexus 10 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.810
 I takes some getting very good 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.269
 it seems a bit hard to me 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.820
 even if it is so if both 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.709
 Devices iPad and the nexus in hand 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.490
 they are more or less 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.099
 otherwise identical to that of the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.310
 touch it , that's what I call it 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.889
 you 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.400
 something unpleasant first in the first 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.870
 moment like when I did that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 ipad had the first time in hand with 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.850
 this aluminum surface that the 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.080
 nexus is naturally rubberized that feels 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.389
 one also feels completely different 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.710
 I hope that it is a material 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.270
 not again 1000 feet so 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.760
 is stuck feels namely 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.100
 like a slightly rubberized surface 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.080
 and I hope that as I said that because 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.669
 not somehow immediately 1000 crumbs 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.210
 and the like 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.800
 I will not get any for that 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.720
 Protective cover or similar buy around that 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.880
 however, to counteract this 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.770
 I get such a bag with the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.389
 the part easily through the area 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.970
 For example, if you can feel 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.889
 if you take it outside with you always 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.300
 direct comparison with the ipad one becomes 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.850
 now on the video is not seen here 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.440
 the display of course finer as well 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.200
 a much higher resolution has none 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.340
 ask the mirror and so on 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.229
 you do not need to think about it 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.910
 this is a device that has a glass front 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.130
 that always reflects that it is also more complete 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.960
 nonsense that it is that somewhere 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.600
 is repeated or is being considered 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.250
 and the viewing angle stability that I have 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.780
 now here so very amateurish 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.000
 try to represent there 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.860
 This is super so in both devices 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.910
 compared to this cheap tablets 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.729
 I've been one of those in the past 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.140
 Hand had since there is even at all 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.780
 nothing could be said now that is 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.580
 with the nexus 10 still a very small one 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.950
 a little bit better is completely honest 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.500
 when do you watch a movie or 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.000
 a website or a book times even so 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.760
 a perspective on that comes so well 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.690
 like never before 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.580
 Accordingly, that is actually too 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.789
 completely unimportant point as long as the 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.010
 viewpoint is not super weak yes 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.450
 so nexus 7 you still want it that way 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.650
 He still wants her system update 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.910
 I'll have that after too 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.800
 run through indirectly 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.860
 in direct comparison, I would say 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.669
 that the display is more or less 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.720
 it is equivalent to seeing it here on the 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.340
 video a little bit 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.740
 weaker but I think that lies 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.330
 rather that the nexus 7 in me 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.250
 the brightness is a bit weaker 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.450
 set is maybe lit up 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.220
 the nexus 10 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.840
 basically a bit stronger that 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.550
 It can be, that's what I want now 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.740
 I do not question anyone 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.450
 have both automatic 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.130
 brightness displayed next time 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.599
 scenes I have almost all the way down there 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.660
 turned and it still lights up 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.970
 very full and very intense 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.110
 I have an artificial one now 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:47.080
 Lighting here in the room in the office and 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.210
 therefore, that is missing that one there 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.530
 even the full brightness needs something 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.610
 I was a bit annoyed at the beginning 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.760
 This is automatically honesty 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.140
 correction that always takes the display 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.430
 again a bit downhill then 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.740
 a few seconds later something again 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.600
 high and that annoyed me personally 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.370
 when I'm out of the house doing that 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.630
 certainly useful as it is a I think 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.960
 a function that I also use 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.700
 would be with a tablet that is too me 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.230
 would say in the predominant part with me 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.120
 in the office and at home use 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.920
 this function plays a role 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.850
 subordinate role and also the one 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.890
 I do not want to have 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.440
 That was my first impression of the nexus 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.870
 10 I'm hanging off my standard intro 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.550
 if you fun a ego shooter 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.590
 first person shooting then you look 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.490
 Just once in my videos I'm pure 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.380
 I am happy about new subscribers 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.430
 comments and everything to do with it 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.430
 until then believe 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.040
 as
