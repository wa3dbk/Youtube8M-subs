00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
your computer and if you reverse or turn

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.199 
your computer and if you reverse or turn
it<00:02:06.000> around<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> Photoshop

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
it around you can do that in Photoshop

it around you can do that in Photoshop
once<00:02:09.209> you've<00:02:09.360> printed<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.869> out<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.470> can

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
once you've printed it out then you can

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.309 
once you've printed it out then you can
apply<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.819> back<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.450> this

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
apply it to the back of this

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.500 
apply it to the back of this
to<00:02:13.379> get<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.769> cut<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.459> it'll<00:02:14.640> show<00:02:14.909> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
to get the cut out so it'll show the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.079 
to get the cut out so it'll show the
correct<00:02:15.840> way
