00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello and welcome each 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.759
 angeles hardware reviews today again 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 once with a new intel cpu and 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:25.550
 Although I am in this video today 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 around the intel pentium d 860 processor 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.400
 jews ever stands we have here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.530
 Of course again a cpu for the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.500
 current 11 55 socket by intel 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 Of course that's a desktop processor 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.710
 from the pentium series on the basis of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.649
 32 nanometer production and is thus one 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 sandy bridge cpu we come here like 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.280
 always to the packaging that is with this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.410
 Pensum not great in the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.710
 compared to another processor 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 packaging on this page we have 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.539
 then have some technical data like 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.789
 For example, we are a real one 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.420
 2-core processor without hyperthreading 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:13.190
 or hyper threading so 2.2 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.229
 We have installed the intel hd graphics 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.759
 as well as an integrated memory 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 controller for ddr3 of course and indeed 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.160
 here again the ddr 1300 and 33 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.140
 megahertz module and yunnan we because 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.610
 nothing more you know first 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.550
 the cpu should be here already 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.390
 again a few hints what these 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.739
 Packaging contains beside one 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 Cooling solution of course, the processor 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:50.399
 and a quick start guide or snow 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 instruction in german said yes we 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.420
 have the g 8 160 processor here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.780
 smooth with 3 gigahertz with a 3 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.920
 mb l3 cache for the socket lga 11 55 with 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.610
 65 wd tdp I grab now 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.940
 Of course, the same mark from why one 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.920
 island packing by the officers 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.380
 his class in this carton in the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.420
 cdu velvet fan 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.460
 That's why I'll get to the product right away 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.460
 Of course , we do, of course, like we do 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.280
 always with a quick start booklet 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:33.950
 by intel and the sticker for the case 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.610
 next to it, the location in the box it 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.670
 fan with its 4 pin pwm fan 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.960
 connection and applied thermal grease 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.890
 with this post system and then have 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.100
 of course we also studied here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.260
 processor I unpack and then 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.290
 Let's look at something in this market 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 more accurate 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.560
 so I have to process summer 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.420
 I hope you can do everything 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.570
 inside what's on it and that is there 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.670
 in penzing g8 160 on it with 3 0 ghz 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.440
 Of course I wanted to pay attention to you 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.110
 that if you will built a cpu 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.489
 you first so you do not have any 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:23.300
 technical defects on these yet 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.510
 considerably more expensive products product 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.200
 individually compared to 2 eg 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.330
 dvd drive of it yes the processor of 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 Of course, intel is standard 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.440
 optically held 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.110
 at each are equal on the underside 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.800
 only the pure contact surfaces are not 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.360
 as for you these pins even here with 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.430
 to facilitate the notch 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.440
 installation on a respective one 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.180
 mainboard does not repeat it yet 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.160
 once we have a cpu here for the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.840
 11 55 clock socket so need 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 accordingly, a mainboard with 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.510
 the 11 55 socket on this cpu is 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.470
 not really for all chipsets 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.019
 ranging from 61 to 77 z therefore 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.680
 should be easily recognized at each location 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.840
 and run and I think you should 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.340
 this three gigahertz intel beginner 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.380
 been cpu 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.670
 Of course, everybody knows who they are 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.590
 A cdu can buy with no one 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.000
 It's also here to do something 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.200
 not the purpose and yes me 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.670
 thank you for this 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.350
 I would watch over comments 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.970
 reviews and appreciate Subscribe 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.130
 Now follow a few pictures like 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.510
 always and then we see each other the next 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.130
 once again line up people until the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.130
 next time and bye
