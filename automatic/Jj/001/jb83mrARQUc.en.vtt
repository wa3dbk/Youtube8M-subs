heritage<00:01:09.659> also<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.290> different<00:01:10.650> lines<00:01:10.830> as

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
heritage also has different lines as

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100 
heritage also has different lines as
well<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.340> don't<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.900> if

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
well they don't have just this one so if

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
well they don't have just this one so if
this<00:01:13.590> isn't<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:14.520> interested<00:01:14.880> in

and so she was kind of desperate to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
and so she was kind of desperate to
figure<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> way<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> tame<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> she

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
play-doh I really could actually kind of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.080 
play-doh I really could actually kind of
hate<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> way<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:07.959> smells<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:08.530> um<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.400> said<00:03:10.030> it

looks like and it's like to leave it on

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.000 
looks like and it's like to leave it on
for<00:03:12.340> five<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.880> ten<00:03:12.910> minutes<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.680> don't<00:03:14.680> consider

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
for five to ten minutes I don't consider

my<00:03:15.190> school<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.760> have<00:03:15.940> semi<00:03:16.269> sensitive<00:03:16.720> skin

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
my school I have semi sensitive skin

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.479 
my school I have semi sensitive skin
what<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:17.709> sensitive<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.250> can't

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
what is that so sensitive that I can't

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.099 
what is that so sensitive that I can't
wear<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.640> mask<00:03:18.820> for<00:03:18.970> 10<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.329> 15<00:03:19.420> minutes<00:03:19.630> and

wear a mask for 10 to 15 minutes and
then<00:03:20.739> after<00:03:21.400> about<00:03:21.489> six<00:03:21.790> minutes<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.090> thought

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
then after about six minutes I thought

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.849 
then after about six minutes I thought
it<00:03:22.390> was<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.510> little<00:03:22.810> too<00:03:23.109> harsh<00:03:23.380> for<00:03:23.470> my<00:03:23.680> skin

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
it was a little too harsh for my skin

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.380 
it was a little too harsh for my skin
like<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.100> can<00:03:24.280> feel<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.609> like<00:03:24.700> really<00:03:24.910> working

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
like I can feel it like really working

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.970 
like I can feel it like really working
and<00:03:25.540> kind<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:26.079> burning<00:03:26.320> actually<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.829> little

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.910 
and kind of burning actually a little
bit<00:03:27.220> um<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.660> once<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.959> wash<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.230> off<00:03:29.530> my<00:03:29.709> face

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
bit um but once I wash it off my face

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.310 
bit um but once I wash it off my face
felt<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.519> soft<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.239> once<00:03:32.019> like<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
felt really soft and once like the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.490 
felt really soft and once like the
initial<00:03:32.709> burning<00:03:33.160> kind<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.609> went<00:03:33.820> away<00:03:33.910> um

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
initial burning kind of went away um

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.050 
initial burning kind of went away um
after<00:03:35.500> having<00:03:35.950> washed<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.310> off<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.670> felt

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.520 
after having washed it off it felt
really<00:03:37.150> nice<00:03:37.510> if<00:03:37.720> my<00:03:37.840> skin<00:03:38.019> actually<00:03:38.200> looks

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
really nice if my skin actually looks

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.110 
really nice if my skin actually looks
really<00:03:38.620> pretty<00:03:39.070> um<00:03:40.200> at<00:03:41.200> least<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.500> thought<00:03:41.709> so

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
really pretty um at least I thought so

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and I tried like I said I only tried it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.990 
and I tried like I said I only tried it
once<00:03:44.560> last<00:03:45.160> night<00:03:45.370> but<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.519> still<00:03:45.760> really<00:03:45.940> like

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
that's kind of shocking because I even

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.020 
that's kind of shocking because I even
am<00:03:51.010> what<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.670> called<00:03:51.850> this<00:03:53.160> Quino<00:03:54.160> means<00:03:54.579> um

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
mask it's not like sulfur net that one

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.500 
mask it's not like sulfur net that one
makes<00:04:06.220> me<00:04:06.370> break<00:04:06.579> out<00:04:06.700> sometimes<00:04:07.120> too<00:04:07.329> but

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
makes me break out sometimes too but

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
breakouts I get from those masks are

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.930 
breakouts I get from those masks are
almost<00:04:10.480> immediate<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.160> don't<00:04:12.519> know<00:04:12.639> what<00:04:12.820> I

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
I don't know if it's because the the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.440 
I don't know if it's because the the
organic<00:04:16.220> parts<00:04:16.489> they<00:04:16.609> use<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.850> harris<00:04:17.150> film
