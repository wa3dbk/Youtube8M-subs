00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.630
 speaks guys Beauty s / n there with another 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.830
 technological review on my board 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.410
 video that we have 440 1 gb and 128 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.500
 and you are seeing there in dollars item 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.420
 correct you see the graphic quality is 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.510
 very good 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.590
 the scenario is perfect the game really 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:47.260
 he overcame in relation to the effects 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.719
 visual and executioner gameplay well 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 We are talking here today about the 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.280
 board is this hdmi video card from 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.969
 low cost 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.670
 the saints already have a price there not much 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.000
 high then if you want a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.980
 video to run type this example game 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.140
 This game will one day have 41 other game 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.930
 Whatever you 're crazy to buy 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.000
 but need to buy the first pay turns 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.790
 so I recommend this board 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.939
 you see here that wheel flat wheel the game 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:31.119
 okay but I'll say so I'll show 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:33.729
 for you as you are here unlike 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.110
 some games I 've been recording with a 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.899
 showing here the performance on this board 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.640
 here is in the middle simply the game 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.759
 it has a better graphic than what 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.060
 Did you see it might even seem like that 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:54.810
 there is no graphic on top but I 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:59.979
 I already tested here in the extreme nor does it generate 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 wheel lighter than just in the raid ranking 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.200
 aids there the name come out on high 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.020
 Let's speak Portuguese, who came in 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.580
 then bahia at the top is the wheel but still 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.370
 so give 1 leg 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.700
 now in the normal mid-wheel a graph is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.290
 just like you saw there 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.489
 so I think it's more than the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:32.260
 enough 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:34.030
 Anyone who plays you would be beautiful and I 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.860
 neither he 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.459
 the chart does not find most amazing is that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.760
 is not on top 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:50.800
 is not on top and wheel is quiet 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.810
 now it seems until it's in the world looks 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.670
 It seems until it is at maximum you see there. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.030
 O details of motorcycle theft 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.030
 lilly 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:14.670
 I know mine and run outta champion 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.410
 in the middle of such advice you want a 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.280
 divine wave 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.490
 There's money to spend, that's it. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.570
 I advise you to pick up the plate and it should come out 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.210
 any doubt regarding the price of it 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.110
 I speak, I will not speak here in the video but 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.450
 You comment if you know the price of it. 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.390
 model that has several brands of god is 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.110
 This one here she has a little 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.050
 high 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:48.630
 so it helps mainly in these 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.500
 in these games is a little heavy and 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.450
 another thousand 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.340
 I mean all the games will see there that 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.890
 you are seeing on the channel 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.800
 It's with that badge out there you can already have 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.320
 an idea of ​​graphic quality in 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.350
 some games and most games clear 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.140
 it's on top is not in Mexico that 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.390
 game is spoon never cocha of the middle 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.180
 it is very so if you have a board 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.000
 video one and I you have not even go to 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.100
 inside that will not turn here with 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.040
 this machine looks at the description you are going 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.240
 see the fact that the mark with that mark 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.960
 four cores and this video card in the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.270
 high 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.990
 Leg imagine if you have a mass andou 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.460
 core with the mqq num board is very cool 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.780
 then the tip is there and even more and 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:45.580
 it is logical 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.580
 You even had the smoke. 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.860
 the pedal 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.139
 i
