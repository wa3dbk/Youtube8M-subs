00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.960
 hi to all and good tests 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.410
 mobile.fr it is in cs 2015 on the stand 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.900
 asus 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.610
 while he was presenting his iphone 2 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.969
 we could see in a video taken 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.620
 in hand 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.090
 just for information then I you 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.770
 had spoken if you looked at this 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.360
 video I told you about coke that 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.800
 you can buy with styles 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.630
 really really nice 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.480
 so here in this case it's the series 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.730
 what they call the illusion series he 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.919
 there is a series called defectors 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.700
 young hockey that looks like 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.140
 flips cover with a see a window 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.930
 go i want to show without a little moment 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.640
 so there for example we have this model the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.400
 kippa evil vigilante I can not 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.960
 approach there there is glass there I can 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.160
 not show them better than that so 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.430
 this one with a slight relief 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.290
 frankly it's original it's not no 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.420
 not bad behind the see with 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.810
 more to one side a little quilted a little 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.610
 more classy design there here same kind 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.690
 but colored with below you see the 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.000
 outputs for the speaker 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:07.420
 I can but I can we but it would be 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.830
 already not bad to see now this one 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.040
 the one on the left intrigues me 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.229
 little 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.940
 then that's so it's really not 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.420
 very beautiful but why not a little 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.930
 gradient in gray and yellow-gray 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.400
 yellow 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.170
 then after what we have here I 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.299
 I know it was Patel 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.680
 to put green there is a version 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:34.840
 more in gradient of blue gradient of pink 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.360
 just here and there interesting and who has a 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.860
 relief with stripes like that but 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.710
 have a little background it's a bit like 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.750
 waves 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.940
 that's it for this part and 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.010
 then after that you have what seems 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.750
 be esses view a bit like ds 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.689
 simulated bouconne to use the term 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.630
 from a-2 samsung we only have three there 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.189
 for once but just as original 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.189
 so here here rather zebra 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.319
 the most classic I imagine will kill 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.299
 maybe not that color there then 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.890
 then it makes it to the camera but red 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.850
 it's orange 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.480
 alas here this one is enough 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.099
 Also interesting here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.459
 currently I have no strict idea 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.030
 price it's I absolutely do not know 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.290
 how much will cost and may but that's so 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.459
 you are interested interested in this 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.090
 product that wanted to make it a little 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.860
 little single 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.080
 you will have the opportunity to do it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.739
 in the next few weeks 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.739
 see you soon
