so<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.729> was<00:01:47.729> dragged<00:01:47.939> them<00:01:48.060> down

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
so there we go I was dragged them down

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
so there we go I was dragged them down
because<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> less<00:01:48.960> effort<00:01:49.409> from<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.799> mouth

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
because is it less effort from my mouth

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.710 
because is it less effort from my mouth
so<00:01:50.310> basically<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.210> double<00:01:51.450> click<00:01:51.570> them

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
so basically just double click them

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.270 
so basically just double click them
you'd<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.200> drag<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.979> just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you'd have to drag them in so just

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.749 
you'd have to drag them in so just
double<00:01:53.340> click<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.899> keep<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
double click on them keep going and it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.090 
double click on them keep going and it
takes<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.540> while<00:01:57.780> no<00:01:58.290> probably<00:01:58.740> take

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
takes a little while no probably take

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
takes a little while no probably take
you<00:01:59.280> 15<00:01:59.759> minutes<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> stack<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.640> 250<00:02:02.640> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you 15 minutes to do a stack of 250 so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.020 
you 15 minutes to do a stack of 250 so
but<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.170> 250<00:02:05.159> rolls<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> dice

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but then you get 250 rolls of the dice

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.619 
but then you get 250 rolls of the dice
to<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.780> uh<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.090> good<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.420> Jules

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
than 250 because when you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
than 250 because when you
gamings<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.460> one<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.970> an<00:02:15.060> ornament<00:02:15.330> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
gamings like one you get an ornament you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.300 
gamings like one you get an ornament you
get<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> normal<00:02:15.960> one<00:02:16.080> back<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.920> you're<00:02:17.070> going<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
get a normal one back so you're going to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.560 
get a normal one back so you're going to
get<00:02:17.430> about<00:02:17.640> three<00:02:17.940> hundred<00:02:17.970> rolls<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
get about three hundred rolls of the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.530 
get about three hundred rolls of the
dice<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:21.000> keep<00:02:21.180> chuckling

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
dice so you know just keep chuckling

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.340 
dice so you know just keep chuckling
them<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.850> anything<00:02:27.350> I'm

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
them and see if we get anything I'm

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.170 
them and see if we get anything I'm
gonna<00:02:28.920> probably<00:02:29.220> fast<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.910> there<00:02:30.090> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
gonna probably fast for this there you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.640 
gonna probably fast for this there you
go<00:02:30.270> that's<00:02:30.450> something<00:02:30.840> not<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.380> worth

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
go that's something not really worth

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.260 
go that's something not really worth
anything<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.120> proves

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
anything but you know that just proves

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.910 
anything but you know that just proves
that<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.570> know<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.200> them<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
that you know you do get them out of it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.980 
that you know you do get them out of it
doing<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.370> way<00:02:35.580> they<00:02:36.000> do<00:02:36.150> upgrade<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:39.840> going

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
doing this way they do upgrade not going

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.570 
doing this way they do upgrade not going
to<00:02:40.050> make<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.200> watch<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:40.740> 15<00:02:41.310> minutes

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
to make you watch this with 15 minutes

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.170 
to make you watch this with 15 minutes
I'm<00:02:41.700> probably<00:02:41.880> will<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.300> jump<00:02:42.420> ahead<00:02:44.180> just

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
I'm probably will just jump ahead just

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.060 
I'm probably will just jump ahead just
get<00:02:45.330> another<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.960> for<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:49.070> so

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just double click them it's the easiest

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.180 
just double click them it's the easiest
way<00:02:52.350> really<00:02:52.620> there's<00:02:52.800> another<00:02:53.010> one

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
way really there's another one

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.890 
way really there's another one
paralyzation<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:54.300> really<00:02:54.480> worth<00:02:54.600> much<00:02:54.870> but

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
paralyzation not really worth much but

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.560 
paralyzation not really worth much but
you<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.500> shows<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:57.450> know

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
you know it just shows that you know

you know it just shows that you know
this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.780> pretty<00:02:58.080> viable<00:02:58.380> as<00:02:58.950> getting<00:02:59.280> a<00:03:00.440> new

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
this is pretty viable as getting a new

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.440 
this is pretty viable as getting a new
exotic<00:03:01.830> sigils<00:03:02.370> out<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.150> skip<00:03:03.330> on

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
exotic sigils out of it so just skip on

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.080 
exotic sigils out of it so just skip on
a<00:03:03.480> little<00:03:03.720> bit<00:03:03.860> okay<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.250> go<00:03:05.370> talking
