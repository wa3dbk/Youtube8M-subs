00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 very good looking state that we are in 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:10.889
 minecraft 1.6 points let's see a map 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.469
 for thaci clues and know-how and for that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.640
 suit to what day he would be he wanted no 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.720
 archer and I hope archery is a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.170
 minigame so disc we already made a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.519
 map of the disk guitar but done 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 for example there is another one that is much more 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.470
 famous that is the temple at night but 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.240
 well let's try it 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.560
 here there are weird things something what 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.480
 we will investigate because I always like 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.180
 read though I do not understand anything but I 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.910
 like to see it we are always going to make it easy 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.290
 would not be 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.410
 I say that it will be necessary to be on top 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.489
 because that is medium and that is difficult if 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.580
 he puts it that way I guess now that he's 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.910
 over there as you can see here there are little dots 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.120
 because in each of these of these 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.390
 targets in the center and a mini kart if 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.390
 we give him 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 if we give it 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:11.980
 if we give a should plug in 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.970
 as usually a little noise and the whole plan 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.970
 they are very bad 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.030
 Click is supposed to be coming out more 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 of jail that's why nothing happens to me 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.820
 link year 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.090
 and the truth is that it seemed very 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.369
 curious and is that I really do not 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.670
 I understand both the rest and that is 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.219
 I really see some things like this to me 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.920
 has cost 2 there like all this that I 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.670
 is that I really can hallucinate 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.670
 link 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.780
 it's a map that is not for 1.6 point 2 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.439
 that is , I put it on for this 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.570
 this version but the map you have to 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.120
 convert it before then it is possible 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 that some failures 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.630
 kling I think it was in 1.5 I think that 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.650
 they added the changes of this rest 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.910
 then it is possible that there are failures 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.330
 but they work fixed 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.200
 link is the number from here you have 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.580
 that nuance and still not 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.580
 since we give to reset 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.740
 It is true 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.990
 shot double there's a bit weird the subject 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.790
 is that if you do this for example 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.190
 how many are the degrees seen one two 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.000
 three four five six seven and eight 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.470
 nine ten points because they give you twelve 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.350
 arrows and then yes it can be 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.550
 complicated good for me and I would have 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.000
 lost its beginning and did not arrive 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.390
 I am more or less 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.710
 was down and not see up here that 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.670
 will have to give him here 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.150
 I do not see it that high 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.409
 I'm not a little shorter 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.409
 no more work 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.460
 It's complicated but it 's pretty cool 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.460
 let's see all this check out 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.660
 the terms will appear either for 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.990
 to illuminate and not get bugs 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.240
 it is possible really here this is a 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.330
 space of cows that activate speed 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.240
 plate 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.630
 is here they activate when they leave if they 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.630
 I want to go out 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.890
 and dies only serves to give this 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.200
 which seems strange to me 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.900
 then activate this 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.470
 my mother is that look how I know 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.849
 they have to ride to do all this 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.530
 things that a cow is the one that activates that 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.860
 what the piston threw it down and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.860
 die 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:16.730
 Look at this as this throw them both 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.730
 and he could see it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.680
 that is me 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.360
 son 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.360
 job 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.610
 this is nonsense 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.920
 I want to throw them away because 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.500
 I do not want to throw it away 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.500
 well this can be more complicated 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.270
 I do not want to break I want to throw them 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.270
 fall down 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.990
 but it is very cool is much more 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:07.030
 surprised because all these things 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.030
 I do not understand them 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.270
 as they have done is that I 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.400
 It seems super complicated but good 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.919
 you have the link to the description too 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.190
 You will have a link to the official video of 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.190
 disk 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.670
 and you are going to fall 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.670
 They pass it to each other 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.660
 ah 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.120
 we liked you have in the 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.860
 description to download it and so on 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.750
 serves for 1.6 points 2 as you are 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.740
 seeing that you have to convert what 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.740
 only automatic in sleeve 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.820
 nuanced
