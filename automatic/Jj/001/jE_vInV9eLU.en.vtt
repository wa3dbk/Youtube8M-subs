morning<00:04:45.530> again<00:04:46.530> he's<00:04:46.710> still<00:04:47.340> not<00:04:47.580> real<00:04:48.180> happy

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
morning again he's still not real happy

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.970 
morning again he's still not real happy
with<00:04:48.780> me<00:04:48.990> but<00:04:51.110> but<00:04:52.110> he'll<00:04:52.260> he'll<00:04:52.650> survive

with me but but he'll he'll survive

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.070 
with me but but he'll he'll survive
because<00:04:53.670> he'll<00:04:54.120> get<00:04:54.210> going<00:04:54.510> again<00:04:54.600> with<00:04:54.930> his

with his female sighs this guy hasn't

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.660 
with his female sighs this guy hasn't
changed<00:04:58.620> much<00:04:58.770> since<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:59.160> last<00:04:59.190> time<00:04:59.640> I

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
changed much since the last time I

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.980 
changed much since the last time I
talked<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.390> know<00:05:00.510> of<00:05:00.600> course<00:05:00.840> these

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
talked to you you know of course these

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.640 
talked to you you know of course these
fish<00:05:01.260> will<00:05:01.440> grow<00:05:02.150> like<00:05:03.150> all<00:05:03.390> fish<00:05:03.690> their

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
fish will grow like all fish their

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.590 
fish will grow like all fish their
entire<00:05:05.010> lives<00:05:05.340> but<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.880> growth<00:05:06.120> certainly

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
entire lives but the growth certainly

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.390 
entire lives but the growth certainly
slows<00:05:07.050> down<00:05:07.320> as<00:05:07.530> they<00:05:07.680> get<00:05:07.830> as<00:05:07.980> they<00:05:08.190> reach

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
slows down as they get as they reach

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.000 
slows down as they get as they reach
maturity<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:09.150> this<00:05:09.330> fish<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.830> probably<00:05:10.830> now

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
maturity and this fish is probably now

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.920 
maturity and this fish is probably now
11<00:05:11.430> years<00:05:11.610> old<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:13.520> I'd<00:05:14.520> say<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.880> size<00:05:15.330> range<00:05:15.630> is

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
11 years old and I'd say a size range is

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.480 
11 years old and I'd say a size range is
still<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.470> same<00:05:16.680> as<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.950> last<00:05:17.130> time<00:05:17.280> I

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
still the same as the last time I

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.540 
still the same as the last time I
guessed<00:05:17.900> somewhere<00:05:18.900> between<00:05:19.020> maybe<00:05:19.770> 24<00:05:20.400> and

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
guessed somewhere between maybe 24 and

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.420 
guessed somewhere between maybe 24 and
28<00:05:20.820> inches<00:05:21.270> something<00:05:21.540> like<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:22.310> he<00:05:23.310> has

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
28 inches something like that he has

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.190 
28 inches something like that he has
probably<00:05:23.760> put<00:05:23.940> on<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.090> little<00:05:24.210> more<00:05:24.450> girth<00:05:24.750> even

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
probably put on a little more girth even

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.900 
probably put on a little more girth even
since<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.560> last<00:05:25.740> time<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:27.920> and<00:05:28.920> height<00:05:29.490> but

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
since the last time and and height but

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.780 
since the last time and and height but
it's<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.300> very<00:05:30.810> powerful<00:05:30.930> fish<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:31.980> he<00:05:32.490> doesn't

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
it's a very powerful fish and he doesn't

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.450 
it's a very powerful fish and he doesn't
like<00:05:32.910> me<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.660> could<00:05:33.810> see<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.410> invade<00:05:35.310> his

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
like me you could see I invade his

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.280 
like me you could see I invade his
territory<00:05:36.030> which<00:05:36.210> is<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.450> entire<00:05:36.750> tank<00:05:37.080> and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
territory which is the entire tank and

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.160 
territory which is the entire tank and
he'll<00:05:37.380> come<00:05:37.560> after<00:05:37.890> me<00:05:38.010> females<00:05:38.900> just<00:05:39.900> about

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
he'll come after me females just about

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.530 
he'll come after me females just about
as<00:05:40.380> aggressive<00:05:40.860> these<00:05:40.980> days<00:05:41.040> all<00:05:41.940> in<00:05:42.240> all<00:05:42.360> it's

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.160 
but there are differences and one of the
biggest<00:06:15.630> differences<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.380> if<00:06:17.220> I<00:06:17.520> had<00:06:17.790> a<00:06:18.170> dough

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
biggest differences is if I had a dough

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.790 
biggest differences is if I had a dough
by<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.470> same<00:06:20.040> size<00:06:20.400> as<00:06:20.820> that<00:06:21.060> um<00:06:21.720> B<00:06:22.020> that<00:06:22.770> I

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
by the same size as that um B that I

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.240 
by the same size as that um B that I
showed<00:06:23.190> you<00:06:23.220> at<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.490> beginning<00:06:23.640> of<00:06:24.030> this

showed you at the beginning of this
video<00:06:26.720> I<00:06:27.720> would<00:06:27.960> be<00:06:28.170> able<00:06:28.380> to<00:06:28.560> put<00:06:28.860> him<00:06:29.040> in<00:06:29.220> the

video I would be able to put him in the

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.640 
video I would be able to put him in the
1,000<00:06:30.150> gallon<00:06:30.390> tank<00:06:30.630> right<00:06:30.870> now<00:06:30.900> without<00:06:31.470> any

with<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:35.770> MB<00:06:36.070> I<00:06:36.280> can't<00:06:36.639> do<00:06:36.790> that<00:06:36.970> they<00:06:37.810> are<00:06:37.840> not

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
with the MB I can't do that they are not

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.850 
with the MB I can't do that they are not
at<00:06:40.660> the<00:06:40.780> same<00:06:41.020> league<00:06:41.380> when<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.860> comes<00:06:42.130> to

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
at the same league when it comes to

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.129 
at the same league when it comes to
combativeness<00:06:44.860> or<00:06:45.400> ability<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.240> survive<00:06:46.660> and

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
thrive in a community like that when

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.930 
thrive in a community like that when
they're<00:06:50.470> very<00:06:50.620> small<00:06:50.770> what<00:06:51.460> the<00:06:51.580> dough<00:06:51.730> buy

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
they're very small what the dough buy

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.540 
they're very small what the dough buy
would<00:06:52.150> do<00:06:52.300> is<00:06:52.540> he<00:06:53.230> would<00:06:53.350> already<00:06:53.560> even<00:06:54.340> at<00:06:54.430> the

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
would do is he would already even at the

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.570 
would do is he would already even at the
small<00:06:54.820> size<00:06:55.110> try<00:06:56.110> to<00:06:56.169> become<00:06:56.919> dominant<00:06:57.400> and

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
small size try to become dominant and

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.659 
small size try to become dominant and
fish<00:06:58.389> that<00:06:58.570> he<00:06:58.660> was<00:06:59.380> not<00:06:59.590> able<00:06:59.830> to<00:06:59.980> dominate<00:07:00.280> at

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
fish that he was not able to dominate at

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.750 
fish that he was not able to dominate at
this<00:07:00.850> size<00:07:01.090> he<00:07:01.900> basically<00:07:02.470> size<00:07:02.740> up<00:07:03.070> until<00:07:03.610> he

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
this size he basically size up until he

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.950 
this size he basically size up until he
got<00:07:03.940> to<00:07:04.090> the<00:07:04.180> point<00:07:04.360> where<00:07:04.600> he<00:07:04.690> thought<00:07:04.870> he

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
got to the point where he thought he

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.510 
got to the point where he thought he
could<00:07:05.139> take<00:07:05.290> him<00:07:05.500> and<00:07:05.650> then<00:07:05.740> one<00:07:05.919> by<00:07:06.070> one<00:07:06.100> he

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
could take him and then one by one he

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.770 
could take him and then one by one he
would<00:07:06.669> eliminate<00:07:06.940> the<00:07:07.300> fish<00:07:07.480> in<00:07:07.660> the<00:07:07.750> tank

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
would eliminate the fish in the tank

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.260 
would eliminate the fish in the tank
that's<00:07:08.680> the<00:07:08.890> reason<00:07:09.220> there<00:07:09.370> is<00:07:09.490> no<00:07:09.520> dov'è<00:07:10.090> in

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
that's the reason there is no dov'è in

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.480 
that's the reason there is no dov'è in
that<00:07:10.450> thousand<00:07:10.900> gallon<00:07:11.169> tank<00:07:11.410> the<00:07:12.190> youngbae

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
that thousand gallon tank the youngbae

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.830 
that thousand gallon tank the youngbae
on<00:07:12.610> the<00:07:12.700> other<00:07:12.850> hand<00:07:13.410> will<00:07:14.410> coexist<00:07:14.830> and<00:07:15.600> if<00:07:16.600> he

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
on the other hand will coexist and if he

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.659 
on the other hand will coexist and if he
put<00:07:17.110> in<00:07:17.260> if<00:07:17.470> he's<00:07:17.620> put<00:07:17.890> in<00:07:18.010> when<00:07:18.310> he's<00:07:18.460> too

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
put in if he's put in when he's too

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.470 
put in if he's put in when he's too
young<00:07:19.320> he<00:07:20.320> could<00:07:20.770> be<00:07:21.070> easily<00:07:21.370> demolished<00:07:22.270> by

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
young he could be easily demolished by

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.890 
young he could be easily demolished by
the<00:07:22.810> Jags<00:07:23.169> in<00:07:23.380> that<00:07:23.530> tank<00:07:23.800> which<00:07:24.130> ancho<00:07:24.900> the

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
the Jags in that tank which ancho the

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.800 
the Jags in that tank which ancho the
Fred<00:07:26.200> a<00:07:26.229> number<00:07:26.830> of<00:07:26.950> him<00:07:27.070> so<00:07:27.250> that's<00:07:27.690> one<00:07:28.690> of

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
Fred a number of him so that's one of

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.620 
Fred a number of him so that's one of
the<00:07:28.870> differences<00:07:29.169> anyway<00:07:29.820> I'm<00:07:30.820> here<00:07:31.120> again<00:07:31.450> he

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
the differences anyway I'm here again he

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.670 
the differences anyway I'm here again he
is<00:07:31.780> in<00:07:32.290> all<00:07:32.770> his<00:07:32.800> splendor<00:07:34.139> his<00:07:35.139> colors<00:07:35.530> are

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
is in all his splendor his colors are

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.890 
is in all his splendor his colors are
actually<00:07:35.860> quite<00:07:36.460> a<00:07:36.490> bit<00:07:36.700> better<00:07:36.850> than<00:07:37.240> than

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900 
actually quite a bit better than than

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.240 
actually quite a bit better than than
what<00:07:38.139> they<00:07:38.290> show<00:07:38.500> on<00:07:38.710> this<00:07:38.860> in<00:07:39.250> this<00:07:40.060> tank<00:07:40.390> but

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250 
what they show on this in this tank but

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.250 
what they show on this in this tank but
you<00:07:42.250> could<00:07:42.400> certainly<00:07:42.580> see<00:07:42.790> the<00:07:43.060> size<00:07:43.300> anyhow

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:44.260 
you could certainly see the size anyhow

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.620 
you could certainly see the size anyhow
I<00:07:44.560> hope<00:07:45.100> you<00:07:45.220> enjoyed<00:07:45.550> it<00:07:45.729> and<00:07:45.850> I<00:07:46.240> will<00:07:46.270> talk<00:07:46.600> to
