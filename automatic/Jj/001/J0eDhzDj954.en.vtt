00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
little coffin shape plane which I picked

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.540 
little coffin shape plane which I picked
up<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.109> eBay<00:00:27.619> for<00:00:28.839> very<00:00:29.839> little<00:00:30.079> money<00:00:30.259> indeed

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.950 

it's<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:35.200> little<00:00:36.200> bit<00:00:36.320> old<00:00:36.530> it's<00:00:36.800> got<00:00:37.010> a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
it's a little bit old it's got a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.770 
it's a little bit old it's got a
adjustable<00:00:38.960> toe<00:00:39.410> on<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:40.000> which<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.030> in<00:00:41.390> steel

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
adjustable toe on it which is in steel

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.870 
adjustable toe on it which is in steel
and<00:00:42.760> I'm<00:00:43.760> not<00:00:43.910> sure<00:00:44.150> if<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.300> perhaps<00:00:44.990> was<00:00:45.260> a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
and I'm not sure if that perhaps was a

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.010 
and I'm not sure if that perhaps was a
retrofit<00:00:49.390> kind<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.450> lovely<00:00:50.630> patina<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.770> it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
retrofit kind of lovely patina to it

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.350 
retrofit kind of lovely patina to it
it's<00:00:54.020> pretty<00:00:54.140> much<00:00:55.090> intact<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:58.120> little<00:00:59.120> bit<00:00:59.240> of

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
it's pretty much intact a little bit of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.380 
it's pretty much intact a little bit of
chip<00:00:59.630> out<00:00:59.780> here<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.350> end<00:01:01.120> but<00:01:02.120> there's

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
chip out here on the end but there's

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.240 
chip out here on the end but there's
enough<00:01:02.660> in<00:01:02.870> place<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.470> it<00:01:03.590> feels<00:01:03.890> really

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
enough in place that it feels really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.660 
enough in place that it feels really
comfortable<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.030> hand<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.570> use<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:06.979> I'd<00:01:07.520> be

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
comfortable in the hand to use so I'd be

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.030 
comfortable in the hand to use so I'd be
quite<00:01:07.880> happy<00:01:07.960> if<00:01:08.960> I've<00:01:09.229> restored<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:09.829> to<00:01:10.009> a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
quite happy if I've restored this to a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.480 
quite happy if I've restored this to a
point<00:01:10.280> where<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.460> can<00:01:10.670> use<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:12.130> as<00:01:13.130> an<00:01:13.370> everyday

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
point where I can use it as an everyday

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.200 
point where I can use it as an everyday
tool<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.360> workshop

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210

it's<00:01:17.210> wedge<00:01:17.870> is<00:01:18.230> pretty<00:01:18.890> much<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:19.430> shape<00:01:19.700> a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
it's wedge is pretty much in shape a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.200 
it's wedge is pretty much in shape a
little<00:01:21.830> bit<00:01:21.979> broken<00:01:22.250> off<00:01:22.460> on<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.729> end<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.120> we

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
little bit broken off on the end so we

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.149 
little bit broken off on the end so we
may<00:01:23.420> end<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:23.720> splicing<00:01:24.290> in<00:01:24.409> a<00:01:24.500> little<00:01:24.770> piece<00:01:24.920> on

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
may end up splicing in a little piece on

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:35.289 
may end up splicing in a little piece on
the<00:01:25.280> end<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:31.100> idea<00:01:31.610> came<00:01:31.850> with<00:01:34.030> he's<00:01:35.030> actually

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
the end the idea came with he's actually

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.530 
the end the idea came with he's actually
marked<00:01:37.090> Marples<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.330> Sons<00:01:40.150> it's<00:01:41.150> not<00:01:41.299> very

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
marked Marples and Sons it's not very

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.060 
marked Marples and Sons it's not very
clear<00:01:41.870> but<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.290> can<00:01:42.620> just<00:01:43.010> about<00:01:43.280> read<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:45.070> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
clear but I can just about read that and

Sheffield so names that you've probably

Sheffield so names that you've probably
all<00:01:59.890> reasonably<00:02:00.890> familiar<00:02:01.070> with<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.780> ion

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
all reasonably familiar with the ion

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.020 
all reasonably familiar with the ion
itself<00:02:03.790> lovely<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:04.880> thick<00:02:06.760> it's<00:02:07.760> rather

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
itself lovely and thick it's rather

pitty<00:02:08.450> back<00:02:08.959> from<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.379> bevel<00:02:09.939> but<00:02:10.939> actually

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
pitty back from the bevel but actually

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.320 
pitty back from the bevel but actually
think<00:02:11.720> there's<00:02:12.349> probably<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.549> good<00:02:13.970> few<00:02:14.299> years

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
think there's probably a good few years

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.670 
think there's probably a good few years
worth<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
worth of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.830 
worth of
abuse<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.300> amount<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.629> use<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
abuse in that for the amount of use that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.780 
abuse in that for the amount of use that
I'll<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.290> giving<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:22.940> did<00:02:23.940> sharpen<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.690> edge

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
I'll be giving in I did sharpen the edge

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.259 
I'll be giving in I did sharpen the edge
ground<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.970> Square<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.540> sides<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:29.269> honed

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
ground it Square to the sides and honed

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.900 
ground it Square to the sides and honed
it<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:30.870> bit<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.220> whether<00:02:32.640> it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
it a little bit just to see whether it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.850 
it a little bit just to see whether it
was<00:02:33.860> possible<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.310> use<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> plane<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.660> was

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
was possible to use the plane as it was

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.699 
was possible to use the plane as it was
and<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.370> cut<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.120> cut<00:02:39.500> reasonably<00:02:40.500> well

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
and it cut and it cut reasonably well

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.070 
and it cut and it cut reasonably well
well<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:42.090> should<00:02:42.299> cut<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.569> lot<00:02:42.840> better

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
well I know they should cut a lot better

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.229 
well I know they should cut a lot better
than<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.560> than<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.920> did<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.879> we'll<00:02:45.060> go<00:02:45.209> through

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
than it than it did so we'll go through

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.240 
than it than it did so we'll go through
the<00:02:45.569> whole<00:02:45.660> process<00:02:46.970> clean<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> body<00:02:49.250> get

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the whole process clean up the body get

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.220 
the whole process clean up the body get
the<00:02:50.370> foot<00:02:50.640> moving<00:02:51.299> properly<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.989> nicely

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the foot moving properly and nicely

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
the foot moving properly and nicely
aligned<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.970> sort<00:02:54.180> out<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> wedge<00:02:56.150> do<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
aligned it sort out the wedge do a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.690 
aligned it sort out the wedge do a
little<00:02:57.329> bit<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.690> work<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.140> blade<00:02:58.700> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
little bit will work on the blade to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.319 
little bit will work on the blade to
stop<00:02:59.940> any<00:03:00.120> rusting<00:03:00.599> that's<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
stop any rusting that's on there and

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.650 
stop any rusting that's on there and
then<00:03:03.329> tune<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:03.840> nicely<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.280> cutting

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
then tune it up nicely so it's cutting

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.660 
then tune it up nicely so it's cutting
super<00:03:06.660> smoothing<00:03:07.349> cuts<00:03:10.099> that's<00:03:11.099> going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.549> be

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
super smoothing cuts that's going to be

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.949 
super smoothing cuts that's going to be
a<00:03:11.970> part-time<00:03:12.569> project<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.470> me<00:03:14.569> maybe<00:03:15.569> just

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
a part-time project for me maybe just

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.550 
a part-time project for me maybe just
fitting<00:03:16.319> in<00:03:16.500> an<00:03:16.680> hour<00:03:17.340> or<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> week<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.200> this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
fitting in an hour or so a week so this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.319 
fitting in an hour or so a week so this
series<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:20.010> videos<00:03:20.310> will<00:03:20.579> run<00:03:20.790> over<00:03:21.090> quite<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
series of videos will run over quite a

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.800 
series of videos will run over quite a
lengthy<00:03:21.840> period<00:03:22.079> probably<00:03:23.510> but<00:03:24.510> we'll<00:03:24.630> see

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
lengthy period probably but we'll see

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.229 
lengthy period probably but we'll see
how<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.989> goes<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.560> if<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.609> a<00:03:26.639> bit<00:03:26.790> more<00:03:26.940> time

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
how it goes and if I get a bit more time

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.849 
how it goes and if I get a bit more time
then<00:03:27.569> I'll<00:03:27.720> be<00:03:27.870> able<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.079> do<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.410> little<00:03:28.620> bit

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
then I'll be able to do a little bit

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.610 
then I'll be able to do a little bit
more<00:03:28.889> work<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.900> watch<00:03:31.079> out<00:03:31.319> for<00:03:31.470> more

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
more work on it so watch out for more

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.120 
more work on it so watch out for more
videos<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:32.299> they<00:03:33.299> appear<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.780> channel<00:03:34.170> if
