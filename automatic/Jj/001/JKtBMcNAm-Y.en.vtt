what<00:00:05.200> we<00:00:05.320> have<00:00:05.530> here<00:00:05.800> is<00:00:05.920> our<00:00:06.040> P<00:00:06.340> 1000<00:00:07.150> large

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
what we have here is our P 1000 large

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.080 
what we have here is our P 1000 large
truck<00:00:08.350> tire<00:00:08.650> D<00:00:08.950> mount<00:00:09.219> I'll<00:00:09.490> show<00:00:09.700> you<00:00:09.760> a<00:00:09.850> few

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
truck tire D mount I'll show you a few

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.190 
truck tire D mount I'll show you a few
features<00:00:10.540> of<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:10.750> tool

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
features of the tool

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.890 
features of the tool
before<00:00:12.040> we<00:00:12.130> actually<00:00:12.309> see<00:00:12.640> it<00:00:12.730> in<00:00:12.849> action<00:00:13.000> what

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
before we actually see it in action what

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.140 
before we actually see it in action what
you'll<00:00:14.080> notice<00:00:14.200> here<00:00:14.380> on<00:00:14.710> the<00:00:15.280> prying<00:00:15.610> foot<00:00:15.970> is

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
you'll notice here on the prying foot is

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.030 
you'll notice here on the prying foot is
that<00:00:16.360> we<00:00:16.480> have<00:00:16.630> these<00:00:16.810> special<00:00:17.260> contours

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
that we have these special contours

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.490 
that we have these special contours
those<00:00:18.670> contours<00:00:19.210> allow<00:00:19.720> us<00:00:19.930> to<00:00:20.080> get<00:00:20.230> both

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
those contours allow us to get both

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.849 
those contours allow us to get both
beads<00:00:20.860> first<00:00:21.789> we<00:00:22.029> can<00:00:22.180> get<00:00:22.390> in<00:00:22.539> wedge<00:00:23.500> in<00:00:23.710> there

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
beads first we can get in wedge in there

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.769 
beads first we can get in wedge in there
and<00:00:24.340> take<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.699> first<00:00:24.880> bead<00:00:25.180> off<00:00:25.359> and<00:00:25.660> then

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
and take the first bead off and then

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.019 
and take the first bead off and then
this<00:00:26.439> contour<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.220> its<00:00:27.340> length<00:00:27.609> it<00:00:27.789> allows<00:00:28.000> us

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
this contour and its length it allows us

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.210 
this contour and its length it allows us
to<00:00:28.359> reach<00:00:28.539> down<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:28.990> also<00:00:29.289> grab<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.619> second

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
to reach down and also grab the second

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.330 
to reach down and also grab the second
bead<00:00:30.400> with<00:00:30.640> with<00:00:31.000> one<00:00:31.180> single<00:00:31.600> tool<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:33.160> look

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
bead with with one single tool we look

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.920 
bead with with one single tool we look
here<00:00:33.519> at<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:33.699> backside<00:00:34.150> what<00:00:34.449> we<00:00:34.570> see<00:00:34.750> is

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
here at the backside what we see is

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.189 
here at the backside what we see is
these<00:00:35.830> pivot<00:00:36.250> hooks<00:00:36.600> what<00:00:37.600> these<00:00:37.780> do<00:00:38.019> is<00:00:38.050> they

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
these pivot hooks what these do is they

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.439 
these pivot hooks what these do is they
allow<00:00:38.409> us<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.890> grab<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.430> rim<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:39.879> we<00:00:40.300> have<00:00:40.420> a

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
allow us to grab the rim and we have a

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.380 
allow us to grab the rim and we have a
secure<00:00:40.930> place<00:00:40.960> from<00:00:41.440> which<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.680> pry<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:43.210> that

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
secure place from which to pry here that

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.390 
secure place from which to pry here that
works<00:00:43.629> on<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:44.019> bearing<00:00:44.650> pivot<00:00:44.830> here<00:00:45.190> and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
works on this bearing pivot here and

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.160 
works on this bearing pivot here and
then<00:00:45.940> if<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.120> look<00:00:46.299> at<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.510> heel<00:00:46.720> we<00:00:46.960> have<00:00:47.140> a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
then if you look at the heel we have a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.350 
then if you look at the heel we have a
plastic<00:00:47.799> protector<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:48.940> makes<00:00:49.150> sure<00:00:49.239> that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
plastic protector so it makes sure that

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.600 
plastic protector so it makes sure that
ensures<00:00:50.229> that<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.589> don't<00:00:50.739> ever<00:00:50.860> have<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.129> metal

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
ensures that you don't ever have a metal

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.630 
ensures that you don't ever have a metal
to<00:00:51.729> metal<00:00:51.850> contact<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> rim<00:00:53.769> as<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:54.489> look

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
to metal contact with the rim as we look

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.180 
to metal contact with the rim as we look
at<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.879> handle<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.559> see<00:00:56.769> that<00:00:56.890> we<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.159> a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
at the handle we see that we have a

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.060 
at the handle we see that we have a
slight<00:00:57.790> Bend<00:00:58.089> here<00:00:58.510> what<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.350> does<00:00:59.619> is<00:00:59.920> it

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
slight Bend here what that does is it

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.549 
slight Bend here what that does is it
gives<00:01:00.250> us<00:01:00.339> a<00:01:00.489> little<00:01:00.699> bit<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:01.479> an<00:01:01.629> aggressive

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
gives us a little bit of an aggressive

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.940 
gives us a little bit of an aggressive
bite<00:01:03.010> as<00:01:03.220> we're<00:01:03.549> prying<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.030> tool<00:01:04.239> over<00:01:04.269> so<00:01:04.839> it

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
bite as we're prying the tool over so it

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.740 
bite as we're prying the tool over so it
ensures<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.070> we<00:01:06.369> pry<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:07.030> tire<00:01:07.299> free<00:01:07.630> of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
ensures that we pry that tire free of

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.810 
ensures that we pry that tire free of
the<00:01:07.840> rim<00:01:08.079> and<00:01:08.320> then<00:01:08.859> if<00:01:09.009> you<00:01:09.130> come<00:01:09.280> up<00:01:09.430> here<00:01:09.670> you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
the rim and then if you come up here you

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.770 
the rim and then if you come up here you
see<00:01:10.259> up<00:01:11.259> high<00:01:11.530> this<00:01:11.590> this<00:01:12.270> larger<00:01:13.270> bin<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:13.719> at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
see up high this this larger bin here at

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.330 
see up high this this larger bin here at
the<00:01:13.899> top<00:01:14.140> what<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.590> does<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:14.979> as<00:01:15.130> we're

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
the top what that does is as we're

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.550 
the top what that does is as we're
bringing<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.729> tool<00:01:15.939> over<00:01:15.969> this<00:01:16.420> way<00:01:16.689> it<00:01:17.259> gives

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
bringing the tool over this way it gives

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.649 
bringing the tool over this way it gives
us<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.799> little<00:01:17.920> bit<00:01:18.039> more<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.659> mechanical

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
us a little bit more of a mechanical

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.440 
us a little bit more of a mechanical
advantage<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.829> so<00:01:21.609> we'll<00:01:21.850> see<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.210> action

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
advantage and so we'll see this action

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.069 
advantage and so we'll see this action

on the second side of the tool we have

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.050 
on the second side of the tool we have
this<00:02:00.870> unique<00:02:01.470> contour<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.400> for<00:02:02.640> putting<00:02:02.940> on

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this unique contour here for putting on

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.350 
this unique contour here for putting on
the<00:02:03.210> second<00:02:03.630> feet<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.820> you'll<00:02:05.820> notice<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the second feet and you'll notice that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.770 
the second feet and you'll notice that
we<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.070> contour<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.570> acts

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
we have this this contour here that acts

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.950 
we have this this contour here that acts
as<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.020> stop<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> top<00:02:11.100> side<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:12.180> lot<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.750> tire

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
as a stop on the top side a lot of tire

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.620 
as a stop on the top side a lot of tire
irons<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> market<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> bump<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:14.910> knob

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
irons on the market have a bump or knob

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.530 
irons on the market have a bump or knob
here<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.200> bottom<00:02:16.560> side<00:02:17.210> but<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.360> can

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
here on the bottom side but you can

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.120 
here on the bottom side but you can
overfeed<00:02:18.990> them<00:02:19.020> still<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.920> knob

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
overfeed them still and then that knob

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.680 
overfeed them still and then that knob
and<00:02:20.160> everything<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> entire<00:02:21.000> iron<00:02:21.390> gets

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and everything the entire iron gets

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and everything the entire iron gets
stuck<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.110> there

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
stuck in there

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.620 
stuck in there
that's<00:02:23.070> impossible<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.850> overfeed<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.420> tool

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
that's impossible to overfeed the tool

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.420 
that's impossible to overfeed the tool
because<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> stop<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> top<00:02:26.190> side

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
because we have the stop on the top side

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.600 
because we have the stop on the top side
so<00:02:26.820> we'll<00:02:27.600> see<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.990> large<00:02:28.320> truck<00:02:28.830> tire<00:02:29.250> mount

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
so we'll see this large truck tire mount

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:42.420 
so we'll see this large truck tire mount
er<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.600> action<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> few<00:02:32.340> moments

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.800 

before<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.550> start<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.000> mounting<00:02:44.330> D<00:02:44.480> mounting

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
before we start the mounting D mounting

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.809 
before we start the mounting D mounting
procedure<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.560> thought<00:02:46.010> what<00:02:46.160> we'd<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.610> take

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
procedure I thought what we'd do is take

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.640 
procedure I thought what we'd do is take
a<00:02:46.849> moment<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.390> show<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.870> importance<00:02:48.410> of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
a moment and show you the importance of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.830 
a moment and show you the importance of
good<00:02:49.069> lubrication<00:02:49.580> there<00:02:50.450> are<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.569> number<00:02:50.720> of

lubrication<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.140> key<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.650> any<00:03:15.880> mounting

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
lubrication is the key to any mounting

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.660 
lubrication is the key to any mounting
or<00:03:17.000> d<00:03:17.150> mounting<00:03:17.540> procedure<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.440> so<00:03:18.739> typically

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
or d mounting procedure and so typically

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.320 
or d mounting procedure and so typically
one<00:03:20.420> would<00:03:20.660> choose<00:03:20.930> probably<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> liquid

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
one would choose probably the liquid

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.030 
one would choose probably the liquid
when<00:03:23.330> your<00:03:23.540> D<00:03:23.780> mounting<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.290> tire<00:03:24.560> it's

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
when your D mounting the tire it's

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.500 
when your D mounting the tire it's
usually<00:03:25.220> been<00:03:25.489> on<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.790> rim<00:03:25.970> for<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.269> little

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
usually been on the rim for a little

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.210 
usually been on the rim for a little
while<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.930> comes<00:03:27.170> off<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> little<00:03:27.560> easier<00:03:28.040> and

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
while it comes off a little easier and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.000 
while it comes off a little easier and
the<00:03:28.730> liquid<00:03:29.150> allows<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
the liquid allows it to the the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.090 
the liquid allows it to the the
lubricant<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.610> easily<00:03:32.060> flow<00:03:32.470> between<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.860> rim

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
lubricant to easily flow between the rim

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.940 
lubricant to easily flow between the rim
and<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.760> tire<00:03:34.790> bead<00:03:35.590> whereas<00:03:36.590> if<00:03:36.799> you're

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
and the tire bead whereas if you're

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.800 
and the tire bead whereas if you're
mounting<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.519> tire<00:03:37.760> especially<00:03:38.330> if<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.630> new

mounting a tire especially if it's a new
tire<00:03:39.110> we<00:03:39.680> really<00:03:39.950> recommend<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.580> paste<00:03:40.910> is

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
tire we really recommend the paste is

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.130 
tire we really recommend the paste is
going<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.870> be<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> lot<00:03:42.260> tighter<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.579> rim<00:03:43.820> and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
going to be a lot tighter to the rim and

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.560 
going to be a lot tighter to the rim and
the<00:03:45.140> paste<00:03:45.410> keeps<00:03:45.769> its<00:03:45.950> its<00:03:46.489> viscosity<00:03:46.820> or<00:03:47.420> its

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
the paste keeps its its viscosity or its

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.620 
the paste keeps its its viscosity or its
lubricity<00:03:47.870> quite<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.380> bit<00:03:48.560> longer<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:49.760> as<00:03:50.390> I

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
lubricity quite a bit longer and so as I

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.930 
lubricity quite a bit longer and so as I
said<00:03:50.690> really<00:03:51.170> good<00:03:51.769> lubrication<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.760> key

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
said really good lubrication is the key

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.319 
said really good lubrication is the key
to<00:03:53.180> any<00:03:53.590> mounting<00:03:54.590> D<00:03:55.220> mounting<00:03:55.609> procedure<00:03:56.090> we

to any mounting D mounting procedure we

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:06.770 
to any mounting D mounting procedure we
cannot<00:03:56.690> emphasize<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.230> enough
