00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 we have a lot I believe 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.950
 difficult with genoa because first of all 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.440
 the team that beat us in 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.480
 league is a team that has made 20 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 away points reassembled seven 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.529
 times in disadvantageous situations and will be 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.789
 a difficult difficult game because 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.600
 they have had a week for 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.519
 prepare it and not just practically 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.369
 only today 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.859
 and therefore we must be a lot 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 good especially because I believe that between 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.540
 tomorrow's game will be the stop 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 so we will recover a bit of energy and a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.149
 bit of players and the two games a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.879
 follow bari empoli in the house and parma 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.760
 out are three games I believe are decisive for 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.510
 championship goals for not going to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 messing up to create problems for us 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.739
 being able to better prepare what 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 will be the return of the Italian cup a 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 florence and the fourth final with monaco 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.460
 I read yesterday after I can out the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590
 draw that juventus is had 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.430
 luck in this draw I believe that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 instead maybe you can turn it over 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.600
 given the part the two games he has 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.200
 played at home with Juventus 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.470
 borussia and a dortmund 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.880
 I think maybe they were the others that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 they breathed a sigh of relief a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.509
 don't meet right now I believe 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.909
 that it takes a lot of balance when 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.509
 we do things and above all in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.210
 work and always stay with a profile 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.840
 very low because you are good today 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.570
 tomorrow 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.609
 you're not good anymore and football is nice e 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.420
 bad for this right now 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:58.899
 things are going well and it's time 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:02.409
 where you have to tighten because why 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.209
 you have to be much better now than 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.209
 three months ago and that juventus has 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.989
 had that is has grown a lot in the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.989
 own awareness of their own means 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.670
 a part of the boys was made 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.290
 good job by all are not 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.190
 mine but from all the staff coli 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.660
 who work with me and the company for 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.590
 try to improve but this must 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.260
 be the goal 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.750
 a job that started I think four 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.720
 years ago with the first championship won 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 but do protect at home have given more 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.220
 awareness of their own means 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.299
 but some more certainty does not have to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.299
 absolutely be a point of arrival 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.760
 must be a good starting point 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.620
 starting point where we need to look 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.230
 to continue 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.579
 we have to work to go to 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.700
 still improve those things you don't 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.700
 they go
