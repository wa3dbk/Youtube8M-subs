you<00:00:06.540> know<00:00:06.629> people<00:00:06.960> generally<00:00:07.259> categorize

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
you know people generally categorize

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.370 
you know people generally categorize
something<00:00:08.670> being<00:00:08.849> either<00:00:08.970> early<00:00:09.480> or<00:00:09.719> being

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
something being either early or being

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.499 
something being either early or being
late<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:11.519> there's<00:00:11.759> lots<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.179> different

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
late but there's lots of different

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.669 
late but there's lots of different
points<00:00:12.630> throughout<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.080> approach<00:00:13.380> where<00:00:13.620> you

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
points throughout the approach where you

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.980 
points throughout the approach where you
can<00:00:13.830> actually<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.490> early<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.540> point<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
can actually be early at one point and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
can actually be early at one point and
then<00:00:16.080> late<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.350> another<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:16.890> late<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.430> one

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
then late in another or late at one

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.220 
then late in another or late at one
point<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.060> then<00:00:18.119> end<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.359> early<00:00:18.779> another<00:00:19.020> it's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
point and then end up early another it's

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.920 
point and then end up early another it's
not<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:19.880> categorically<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.210> earlier<00:00:21.630> late

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
not just categorically I'm earlier late

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.480 
not just categorically I'm earlier late
there's<00:00:22.199> different<00:00:22.560> times<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> approach

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
there's different times and the approach

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.759 
there's different times and the approach
when<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.750> or<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> other<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.470> what

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
when you can be one or the other so what

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.009 
when you can be one or the other so what
have<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.920> seen<00:00:26.220> Randy<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.699> think<00:00:27.420> you're

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
have you seen Randy I think you're

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.710 
have you seen Randy I think you're
exactly<00:00:28.380> right<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.000> personally<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.300> going

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
exactly right and personally I'm going

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.799 
exactly right and personally I'm going
through<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> same<00:00:31.289> thing<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.820> had<00:00:33.480> late

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
through the same thing and I had late

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
through the same thing and I had late
timing<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> start<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.550> turned<00:00:35.790> into<00:00:35.969> early

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
timing to start that turned into early

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.549 
timing to start that turned into early
timing<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.140> pull<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.380> from<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
timing because I would pull it from the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
timing because I would pull it from the
top<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> swing<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.750> mind

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
top of the swing so you know your mind

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
top of the swing so you know your mind
knows<00:00:40.230> where<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.920> ball<00:00:41.070> needs<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.550> be

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
knows where you the ball needs to be

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000 
knows where you the ball needs to be
when<00:00:42.300> you're<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> position<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.379> any<00:00:43.469> sport

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
when you're out of position in any sport

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940 
when you're out of position in any sport
there's<00:00:44.460> compensatory<00:00:45.360> moves<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.200> start<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there's compensatory moves that start to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
there's compensatory moves that start to
occur<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.120> getting<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> ball<00:00:48.780> into<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
occur for me getting the ball into the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
occur for me getting the ball into the
swing<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.530> late<00:00:49.829> getting<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
swing a little late getting it to the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
swing a little late getting it to the
top<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.809> late<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.320> forcing<00:00:52.800> me<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
top a little bit late then forcing me to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
top a little bit late then forcing me to
pull<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> turn<00:00:54.420> made<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pull down which then in turn made it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
pull down which then in turn made it
early<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> trends<00:00:57.000> we're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
early so I think one of the trends we're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
early so I think one of the trends we're
seeing<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.870> today's<00:00:58.050> modern<00:00:58.469> game<00:00:58.829> Steve<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
seeing in today's modern game Steve is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700 
seeing in today's modern game Steve is
the<00:00:59.969> long<00:01:00.149> third<00:01:00.449> step<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the long third step now some of the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.170 
the long third step now some of the
greats<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.309> been<00:01:02.460> great<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.969> many

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
greats that have been great for many

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450 
greats that have been great for many
many<00:01:03.390> years<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.320> look<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.619> norm<00:01:04.979> Duke<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
many years you look at norm Duke and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
many years you look at norm Duke and
Pete<00:01:05.640> Weber<00:01:05.880> they've<00:01:06.390> always<00:01:06.570> had<00:01:06.780> an

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
Pete Weber they've always had an

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.050 
Pete Weber they've always had an
elongated<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:07.979> longer<00:01:08.369> third<00:01:08.670> step

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
elongated or longer third step

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
elongated or longer third step
remembered<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> five-step<00:01:10.320> approach<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
remembered a five-step approach and I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.100 
remembered a five-step approach and I
think<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.150> what's<00:01:12.390> enabled<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> be

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
think this is what's enabled them to be

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
think this is what's enabled them to be
great<00:01:13.470> throughout<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> years<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:15.180> that's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
great throughout the years and that's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
great throughout the years and that's
probably<00:01:15.810> given<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.729> they're

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
probably given them the time as they're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
probably given them the time as they're
coming<00:01:18.180> through<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> release<00:01:18.840> point<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.619> have

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
coming through the release point to have

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.960 
coming through the release point to have
that<00:01:20.070> hand<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> right

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that hand and to get it in the right

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
that hand and to get it in the right
spot<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> swing<00:01:22.259> come<00:01:22.560> through<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
spot but the swing come through and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
spot but the swing come through and
they're<00:01:23.310> able<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> create<00:01:23.909> whatever<00:01:24.060> type<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
they're able to create whatever type of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.789 
they're able to create whatever type of
role<00:01:24.689> they're<00:01:24.960> trying<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> create<00:01:25.560> because

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
role they're trying to create because

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.960 
role they're trying to create because
everything<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.189> freed<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
everything is freed up that's the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819 
everything is freed up that's the
biggest<00:01:27.180> thing<00:01:27.330> I've<00:01:27.570> seen<00:01:27.720> yeah<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> mean<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
biggest thing I've seen yeah I mean it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.800 
biggest thing I've seen yeah I mean it
puts<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.240> me<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> puts<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.720> in

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
puts them in it to me it puts them in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.249 
puts them in it to me it puts them in
perfect<00:01:31.229> position<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:32.700> terms<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.240> spine<00:01:33.840> tilt

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
perfect position in terms of spine tilt

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.770 
perfect position in terms of spine tilt
the<00:01:34.860> angle<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.310> their<00:01:35.490> back<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.299> puts<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.630> in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the angle of their back it puts them in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
the angle of their back it puts them in
that<00:01:36.869> great<00:01:37.110> position<00:01:37.590> puts<00:01:38.100> their<00:01:38.280> legs

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that great position puts their legs

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.179 
that great position puts their legs
underneath<00:01:39.030> them<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
underneath them you think about in a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
underneath them you think about in a
five<00:01:41.430> step<00:01:41.670> approach<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> being

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
five step approach the first to being

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
five step approach the first to being
you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.710> let's<00:01:44.250> say<00:01:44.399> equal<00:01:44.610> distance<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you know let's say equal distance and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.819 
you know let's say equal distance and
then<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> third<00:01:45.750> step<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
then the third step all to get all of a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
then the third step all to get all of a
sudden<00:01:47.070> getting<00:01:47.220> short<00:01:47.610> something<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.509> know

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
sudden getting short something I know

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
sudden getting short something I know
all<00:01:48.869> too<00:01:49.049> well<00:01:49.079> well<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> does<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
all too well well what that does is it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.310 
all too well well what that does is it
immediately<00:01:51.060> makes<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> body<00:01:51.689> tip<00:01:52.020> forward

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
immediately makes the body tip forward

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
immediately makes the body tip forward
now<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> weights<00:01:53.430> forward<00:01:53.939> not

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
now all the weights forward not

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
now all the weights forward not
underneath<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.780> you're<00:01:55.680> immediately<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
underneath you you're immediately out of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.580 
underneath you you're immediately out of
position<00:01:57.030> whereas<00:01:57.719> these<00:01:57.899> players<00:01:58.200> getting

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
position whereas these players getting

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
position whereas these players getting
that<00:01:58.680> third<00:01:58.920> step<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.490> longer<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.360> keeps

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that third step to be longer it keeps

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.480 
that third step to be longer it keeps
their<00:02:01.530> center<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> gravity<00:02:02.040> Center

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
their center of gravity Center

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.490 
their center of gravity Center
keeps<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.909> legs<00:02:04.150> underneath<00:02:04.540> them<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.290> puts

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
keeps the legs underneath them and puts

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.549 
keeps the legs underneath them and puts
them<00:02:05.649> in<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.770> perfect<00:02:06.130> position
