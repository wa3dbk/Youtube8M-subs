a<00:01:07.470> lot<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.830> maneuvering<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> great<00:01:09.540> thing

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
a lot of maneuvering but the great thing

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.219 
a lot of maneuvering but the great thing
about<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.380> clockwork<00:01:10.799> assault<00:01:11.100> rifle<00:01:12.229> good

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
about the clockwork assault rifle good

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.030 
about the clockwork assault rifle good
thing<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.530> guys<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.979> completely<00:01:14.400> dumb<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thing these guys are completely dumb the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
thing these guys are completely dumb the
good<00:01:17.280> thing<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.049> first

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
good thing about it is that the first

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.310 
good thing about it is that the first
shot<00:01:19.680> only<00:01:19.950> consumes<00:01:20.729> ammo<00:01:21.150> okay<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.720> every

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
shot only consumes ammo okay so every

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320 
shot only consumes ammo okay so every
shot<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.740> shoot<00:01:22.979> afterward<00:01:23.490> doesn't<00:01:24.150> cost

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
shot you shoot afterward doesn't cost

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
shot you shoot afterward doesn't cost
you<00:01:24.600> ammo<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.229> say<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.500> shoot<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
you ammo so like say you shoot one the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
you ammo so like say you shoot one the
next<00:01:26.909> two<00:01:27.119> bullets<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:28.020> come<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
next two bullets that come out in the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.880 
next two bullets that come out in the
three<00:01:28.890> shot<00:01:29.159> volley<00:01:29.540> actually<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:31.079> consume

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
three shot volley actually don't consume

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
three shot volley actually don't consume
any<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.340> ammo<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.420> up

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
any of your ammo so as you can see up

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.230 
any of your ammo so as you can see up
here<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.020> ammo<00:01:34.259> says<00:01:34.470> 147<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.340> shoot<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
here the ammo says 147 I shoot it it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
here the ammo says 147 I shoot it it
only<00:01:36.390> goes<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> 146<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> good<00:01:38.670> thing

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
only goes down to 146 so the good thing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
only goes down to 146 so the good thing
about<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.479> save<00:01:39.750> tons<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> tons<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
about it is you save tons and tons of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.969 
about it is you save tons and tons of
ammo<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.850> ton<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> ammo<00:01:42.570> right<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
ammo like a ton of ammo right but the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.450 
ammo like a ton of ammo right but the
bad<00:01:44.159> thing<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.790> weak<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:47.310> have

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
bad thing is it's weak and it's you have

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
bad thing is it's weak and it's you have
to<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.729> very<00:01:48.030> accurate<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to be very accurate for it to be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920 
to be very accurate for it to be
effective<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.939> hope<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> guys<00:01:51.540> enjoyed
