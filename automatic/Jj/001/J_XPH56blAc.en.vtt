00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
if I was Cody right they're probably

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.620 
if I was Cody right they're probably
gonna<00:01:15.979> check<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.340> spawn<00:01:16.580> bottom<00:01:17.360> yellow

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
gonna check to spawn bottom yellow

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.070 
gonna check to spawn bottom yellow
rather<00:01:18.440> than<00:01:18.650> top

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.990 

oh<00:01:21.140> that's<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.130> really<00:01:22.340> nice<00:01:22.430> job<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.820> get<00:01:22.940> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
oh that's a really nice job to get a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.280 
oh that's a really nice job to get a
scope<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.340> as<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.610> see<00:01:26.110> moving<00:01:27.110> back

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
scope on it as you can see moving back

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.590 
scope on it as you can see moving back
to<00:01:27.410> s2<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:28.070> checking<00:01:28.340> top<00:01:28.550> yellow<00:01:28.730> I<00:01:29.090> think

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
to s2 just checking top yellow I think

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.630

not literally doing it I think I just
saw<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> top<00:03:49.340> yellow

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.160 

four<00:03:54.300> shot<00:03:54.590> one<00:03:55.590> bag<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:59.070> as<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.370> see<00:03:59.520> just

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
four shot one bag so as you can see just

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.630 
four shot one bag so as you can see just
basically<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.650> really<00:04:02.010> simple<00:04:02.400> stuff

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
basically it's just really simple stuff

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.900 
basically it's just really simple stuff
like<00:04:02.670> no<00:04:03.120> one's<00:04:03.330> day<00:04:03.540> which<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:05.250> holding

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
like no one's day which is just holding

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.020 
like no one's day which is just holding
down<00:04:06.090> one<00:04:06.480> area<00:04:06.900> being<00:04:07.860> on<00:04:08.100> selectable<00:04:08.670> he

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
down one area being on selectable he

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.460 
down one area being on selectable he
probably<00:04:09.240> could<00:04:09.450> if<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.720> kill<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.020> he<00:04:10.170> loaded

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.710 
probably could if I kill if he loaded
but<00:04:10.860> he<00:04:11.100> doesn't<00:04:11.880> really<00:04:12.090> need<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:12.570> that

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
but he doesn't really need to get that

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.390 
but he doesn't really need to get that
killed<00:04:12.990> because<00:04:13.170> he<00:04:13.320> ended<00:04:13.800> up<00:04:13.890> falling<00:04:14.220> off

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
one tire shop so off the spawn right

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.910 
one tire shop so off the spawn right
here<00:05:41.570> he<00:05:41.660> just<00:05:41.840> has<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:41.960> look<00:05:42.170> s<00:05:42.350> to<00:05:42.560> which<00:05:42.740> he

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
here he just has to look s to which he

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.640
