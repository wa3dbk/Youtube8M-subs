one<00:00:16.690> of<00:00:16.780> the<00:00:16.900> things<00:00:17.110> that<00:00:17.500> I've<00:00:17.650> done<00:00:17.830> really

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
one of the things that I've done really

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.150 
one of the things that I've done really
helpful<00:00:18.610> to<00:00:19.090> manage<00:00:19.840> my<00:00:20.020> time<00:00:20.050> is<00:00:20.619> actually

putting<00:00:21.340> sleep<00:00:21.730> as<00:00:21.940> one<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.080> top

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
putting sleep as one of the top

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.179 
putting sleep as one of the top
priorities<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.119> I<00:00:25.599> think<00:00:25.810> when<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.439> did<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:26.920> I

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
priorities and I think when I did that I

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.339 
priorities and I think when I did that I
at<00:00:27.939> times<00:00:28.240> that<00:00:28.390> felt<00:00:28.660> like<00:00:28.810> I<00:00:28.960> didn't<00:00:29.259> have

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
at times that felt like I didn't have

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.159 
at times that felt like I didn't have
enough<00:00:29.650> time<00:00:29.980> but<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.210> quality<00:00:31.720> of<00:00:31.960> the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
enough time but the the quality of the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.229 
enough time but the the quality of the
time<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.379> did<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:32.920> studying<00:00:33.430> was<00:00:33.580> was<00:00:33.910> really

my<00:00:35.050> friends<00:00:35.350> will<00:00:35.440> probably<00:00:35.710> think<00:00:35.890> that<00:00:36.010> I

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
my friends will probably think that I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.150 
my friends will probably think that I
slept<00:00:36.970> through<00:00:37.270> all<00:00:37.360> of<00:00:37.600> VCE<00:00:38.020> but<00:00:38.410> I<00:00:38.440> pretty

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
slept through all of VCE but I pretty

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.820 
slept through all of VCE but I pretty
much<00:00:39.280> got<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:40.180> eight<00:00:40.330> hours<00:00:40.830> regularly

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
much got the the eight hours regularly

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.970 
much got the the eight hours regularly
so<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:43.090> typical<00:00:43.870> day<00:00:44.080> would<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.559> just<00:00:44.769> coming

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
so a typical day would be just coming

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.090 
so a typical day would be just coming
home<00:00:45.420> maybe<00:00:46.420> taking<00:00:47.140> some<00:00:47.320> time<00:00:47.530> out<00:00:47.559> after<00:00:48.070> a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.969 
need yeah I think the key with practice
exams<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:09.130> quality<00:01:09.820> not<00:01:10.180> exactly<00:01:10.630> quantity<00:01:11.350> i

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
exams is quality not exactly quantity i

I had plenty of friends who absolutely

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.040 
I had plenty of friends who absolutely
smashed<00:01:15.340> some<00:01:15.910> of<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.060> practice<00:01:16.390> exams<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.020> I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
smashed some of the practice exams and I

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.900 
smashed some of the practice exams and I
couldn't<00:01:17.590> believe<00:01:17.680> how<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.009> got<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.369> time<00:01:18.580> for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
couldn't believe how I got the time for

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.530 
couldn't believe how I got the time for
it<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:20.560> me<00:01:20.680> personally<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.880> was<00:01:22.060> easy<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.330> feel

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
it for me personally it was easy to feel

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.660 
it for me personally it was easy to feel
guilty<00:01:22.900> about<00:01:22.930> not<00:01:23.229> doing<00:01:23.439> so<00:01:23.830> many<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:24.640> I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
guilty about not doing so many but I

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.670 
guilty about not doing so many but I
found<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.330> I<00:01:25.479> still<00:01:25.720> got<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.900> lot<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.200> value

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
found that I still got a lot of value

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.910 
found that I still got a lot of value
out<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.820> relatively<00:01:28.750> few<00:01:29.170> number<00:01:29.200> compared

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
out of a relatively few number compared

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.520 
out of a relatively few number compared
to<00:01:30.070> what<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:30.790> others<00:01:31.090> did<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.229> key

to what what others did and and the key

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.890 
to what what others did and and the key
is<00:01:32.860> really<00:01:33.820> making<00:01:34.030> sure<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.479> when<00:01:34.780> you're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
second time after you've time yourself

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and making sure that in future cases or

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.030 
and making sure that in future cases or
if<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.689> change<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.200> question<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.650> little<00:01:53.770> bit

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
if you change the question a little bit

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.469 
if you change the question a little bit
would<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.400> still<00:01:54.640> be<00:01:54.729> able<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.909> do<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.180> again

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
would you still be able to do it again

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.660 
would you still be able to do it again
and<00:01:56.320> if<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.829> can<00:01:56.979> do<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.369> then<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:57.579> think

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and if you can do that then I think

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.310 
and if you can do that then I think
you've<00:01:57.970> got<00:01:58.180> value<00:01:58.509> out<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.659> that<00:01:58.780> exam

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
you've got value out of that exam

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.950 
you've got value out of that exam

dispute that but at the same time I it's
made<00:02:14.620> up<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.550> many<00:02:15.819> individual<00:02:16.480> components

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
made up of so many individual components

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.610 
made up of so many individual components
so<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.380> speak<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.940> guess<00:02:19.780> aiming<00:02:20.319> for<00:02:20.500> it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so to speak that I guess aiming for it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.280 
so to speak that I guess aiming for it
can<00:02:20.860> sometimes<00:02:21.100> be<00:02:21.430> dangerous<00:02:22.060> because<00:02:22.300> well

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
can sometimes be dangerous because well

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.110 
can sometimes be dangerous because well
I<00:02:23.319> guess<00:02:23.650> if<00:02:23.950> you've<00:02:24.100> got<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> lot<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.700> things

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
I guess if you've got a lot of things

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.330 
I guess if you've got a lot of things
contributing<00:02:25.810> towards<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.500> not<00:02:26.950> everything's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
contributing towards it not everything's

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.750 
contributing towards it not everything's
going<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.550> go<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.760> plan<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.780> for<00:02:29.290> me<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:30.190> try<00:02:30.700> to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
going to go to plan so for me I I try to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.570 
going to go to plan so for me I I try to
keep<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.180> more<00:02:31.390> subject<00:02:32.050> focus<00:02:32.620> rather<00:02:33.310> than

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
keep it more subject focus rather than

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.270 
keep it more subject focus rather than
eight<00:02:33.790> are<00:02:34.000> focused<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.350> through<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:36.010> just

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
eight are focused and through that just

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.150 
eight are focused and through that just
try<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> ensure<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.390> am<00:02:38.050> giving<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
try to ensure that I am giving the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.710 
try to ensure that I am giving the
amount<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.459> time<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> think<00:02:40.269> is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
amount of time that I think is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.850 
amount of time that I think is
reasonable<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.930> giving<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.350> best<00:02:44.530> so

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
reasonable and I'm giving my best so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.800 
reasonable and I'm giving my best so
speak<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.400> those<00:02:45.519> individual<00:02:46.060> subjects<00:02:46.630> and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
speak in those individual subjects and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.560

whatever happened after that you know I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.020 
whatever happened after that you know I
couldn't<00:02:50.230> ask<00:02:50.320> any<00:02:50.590> more<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.920> myself<00:02:51.100> so<00:02:51.730> why

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
couldn't ask any more of myself so why

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.330 
couldn't ask any more of myself so why
bother<00:02:52.239> beating<00:02:52.630> myself<00:02:52.750> up<00:02:53.080> about<00:02:53.230> it
