00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
they've just try to go for more of

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
they've just try to go for more of
something<00:01:18.000> i<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.810> first<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.259> all

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
something i think that was first of all

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.600 
something i think that was first of all
considered<00:01:19.860> maybe<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> gossip

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
considered maybe more of a gossip

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.990 
considered maybe more of a gossip
oriented<00:01:21.330> blog<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> sort<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.759> news<00:01:23.759> with

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
edge to more of a mainstream news site

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
edge to more of a mainstream news site
and<00:01:26.400> they're<00:01:26.490> getting<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.790> lot<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> credit

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and they're getting a lot of credit

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
and they're getting a lot of credit
they're<00:01:28.619> rebuilding<00:01:28.979> their<00:01:29.460> reputation<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
they're rebuilding their reputation and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.160 
they're rebuilding their reputation and
I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.420> they're<00:01:30.509> doing<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.020> job

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
