00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
could chose a cropped section which
would<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.070> ensure<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.790> all<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> paper

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
would have ensure that all of the paper

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.929 
would have ensure that all of the paper
would<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.469> been<00:02:04.619> filled<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.820> have

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
would have been filled or you could have

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.139 
would have been filled or you could have
chosen<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:07.190> uncropped

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
chosen the uncropped

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
chosen the uncropped
version<00:02:10.019> which<00:02:10.379> gave<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:11.069> entire

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
version which gave you your entire

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
version which gave you your entire
picture<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:11.939> you<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.269> borders<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.079> top

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
picture but you have borders on the top

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.520 
picture but you have borders on the top
and<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> bottom<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.629> know<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.170> tried

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and the bottom and you know I just tried

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
and the bottom and you know I just tried
for<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.730> borders<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:18.360> top<00:02:18.659> and<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
for the borders on the top and the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.759 
for the borders on the top and the
bottom<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:20.269> why<00:02:21.269> not<00:02:21.439> what<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.470> liked

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769

about<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.280> scene<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.610> particular<00:02:23.700> were

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
about this scene in particular were

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.210 
about this scene in particular were
these<00:02:24.480> two<00:02:24.900> bridges<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.189> were<00:02:27.799> one<00:02:28.799> that<00:02:29.069> was

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
these two bridges that were one that was

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.920 
these two bridges that were one that was
more<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.609> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.760> foreground<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.510> other<00:02:30.750> one

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
more so in the foreground the other one

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.929 
more so in the foreground the other one
was<00:02:31.079> sort<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.379> further<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.400> background

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
was sort of further in the background

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:43.190 
was sort of further in the background
and<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.620> if<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:39.319> had<00:02:40.319> my<00:02:40.620> choice<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:42.200> would

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and you know if I had my choice I would

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.069 
and you know if I had my choice I would
get<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:44.420> reprinted<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.930> could<00:02:46.049> be

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
get this reprinted so that it could be

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.289 
get this reprinted so that it could be
bigger<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.799> take<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.579> more<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> paper

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
bigger and take up more of the paper

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.629 
bigger and take up more of the paper
this<00:02:48.540> was<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.930> more<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.409> more<00:02:50.159> of<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.340> test

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
this was just more of a more of a test

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.430 
this was just more of a more of a test
for<00:02:50.909> me<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.480> really<00:02:51.930> didn't<00:02:52.349> know

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
for me and just I really didn't know

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.399 
for me and just I really didn't know
exactly<00:02:52.739> how<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.069> was<00:02:53.310> gonna<00:02:53.459> come<00:02:53.760> out<00:02:54.409> the

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
exactly how I was gonna come out the

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.220 
exactly how I was gonna come out the
picture<00:02:55.769> size<00:02:56.069> itself<00:02:56.579> is<00:02:56.879> smaller<00:02:57.480> than<00:02:58.049> I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
picture size itself is smaller than I

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.129 
picture size itself is smaller than I
would<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.439> wanted<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.099> be<00:02:59.280> but<00:03:00.209> chalk<00:03:00.989> it

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
would have wanted it to be but chalk it

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.839 
would have wanted it to be but chalk it
up<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.379> learning<00:03:01.530> experience<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.609> still

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
up as a learning experience I can still

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.759 
up as a learning experience I can still
have<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.450> framed<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.959> put<00:03:03.989> somewhere<00:03:04.500> else

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
have this framed and put somewhere else

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.460 
have this framed and put somewhere else
but<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.609> know<00:03:05.700> what<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:05.909> want<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.359> do<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.720> wanna

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
but you know what I want to do I wanna

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.839 
but you know what I want to do I wanna
try<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:07.950> other<00:03:08.129> site<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.609> believe

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
try out this other site and I believe

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.050 
try out this other site and I believe
this<00:03:09.030> site<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.389> called<00:03:09.950> easy<00:03:10.950> parents<00:03:11.790> I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
this site is called easy parents I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.490 
this site is called easy parents I
believe<00:03:12.269> that's<00:03:12.540> what<00:03:12.689> it's<00:03:12.810> called<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.260> they

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
believe that's what it's called and they

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.589 
believe that's what it's called and they
seem<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:13.980> specialize<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.669> panoramic<00:03:15.209> pictures

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
seem to specialize in panoramic pictures

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.420 
seem to specialize in panoramic pictures
and<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:16.049> get<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.410> same<00:03:16.680> picture<00:03:16.949> printed

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
and I can get the same picture printed

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.809 
and I can get the same picture printed
on<00:03:17.910> either<00:03:18.419> matte<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:19.109> glossy<00:03:19.379> paper<00:03:19.859> at<00:03:20.699> a

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
on either matte or glossy paper at a

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.259 
on either matte or glossy paper at a
huge<00:03:21.359> size<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.799> done<00:03:23.129> at<00:03:23.639> like

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
huge size I can get this done at like

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.860 
huge size I can get this done at like
two<00:03:25.109> or<00:03:25.319> three<00:03:25.769> feet<00:03:26.250> tall<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:27.030> four<00:03:27.659> or<00:03:27.840> five

two or three feet tall and four or five
feet<00:03:28.349> wide<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.129> wanted<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.540> I'm<00:03:30.720> gonna

feet wide if I wanted to so I'm gonna

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.110 
feet wide if I wanted to so I'm gonna
try<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.109> out<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.560> don't<00:03:31.680> know<00:03:32.069> when<00:03:32.639> exactly

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
try that out I don't know when exactly

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.970 
try that out I don't know when exactly
I'll<00:03:33.449> get<00:03:33.629> around<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.049> doing<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.859> that

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
I'll get around to doing that but that

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.369 
I'll get around to doing that but that
is<00:03:35.190> something<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.699> I<00:03:35.870> want<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.930> do<00:03:37.199> now<00:03:37.349> that

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
is something that I want to do now that

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.339 
is something that I want to do now that
there's<00:03:37.680> anything<00:03:37.919> wrong<00:03:38.519> with<00:03:39.169> with<00:03:40.169> this

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
there's anything wrong with with this

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.020 
there's anything wrong with with this
adoramapix<00:03:40.859> one<00:03:41.250> because<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.609> metallic

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
adoramapix one because the metallic

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.339 
adoramapix one because the metallic
paper<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.449> course<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.870> can't<00:03:43.109> necessarily

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
paper of course you can't necessarily

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.159 
paper of course you can't necessarily
see<00:03:43.919> it<00:03:44.010> on<00:03:44.099> camera<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:45.299> metallic<00:03:45.989> paper

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
see it on camera but the metallic paper

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.599 
see it on camera but the metallic paper
does<00:03:46.560> look<00:03:46.859> very<00:03:47.129> very<00:03:48.120> nice<00:03:48.389> and<00:03:48.659> shiny<00:03:49.169> and

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
does look very very nice and shiny and

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.369 
does look very very nice and shiny and
well<00:03:50.609> metallic<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.510> looks<00:03:51.720> good<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.349> I

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
well metallic so that looks good but I

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.439 
well metallic so that looks good but I
want<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> big<00:03:53.010> print<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.620> yeah<00:03:56.359> you<00:03:57.359> can

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
want a big print of this so yeah you can

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.460 
want a big print of this so yeah you can
probably<00:03:57.629> look<00:03:57.780> forward<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.169> that<00:03:58.260> though<00:03:58.440> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
probably look forward to that though I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.619 
probably look forward to that though I
don't<00:03:58.709> know<00:03:58.889> exactly<00:03:59.190> when<00:03:59.909> I'm<00:04:00.090> going<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.419> do
