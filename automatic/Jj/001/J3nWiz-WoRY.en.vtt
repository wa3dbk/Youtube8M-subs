00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.730
 As a food producer you know that metal detection is an important tool 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.490
 to prevent contamination of the end products but also the administration 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.700
 More and more food companies that are for extra security and therefore 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.020
 less product loss 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.470
 In this short three-minute film we now see how to use one 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.100
 infection with magnets your current metal detectors 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.820
 deploy more effectively 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.490
 Bekaert textiles magnets has a number of major advantages 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 a magnet this is not just the building particle of metal immediately off 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.920
 this way the metal detector becomes less pronounced and another one is created 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.470
 product 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.220
 Recognize 2 metal detectors and metal particles from one and a half 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.240
 millimeters while magnets recognize and remove particles from 20 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.010
 microsievert 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.470
 what a better one so we can see fine particles 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 the text i with magnets is a reliable technique 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.490
 in the equipment of the goldsmith package x, magnetic rods rotate in the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.920
 flow of the product 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 this way there is not yet force-intensive municipality with your product and there arises 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 an optimal separation 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.830
 this technique is extremely suitable for separating very small particles b 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.860
 high capacities 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.600
 even with sticky products 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.190
 therefore more separation at a higher capacity of particles from twenty microns 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.599
 can already be deposited in this way 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.579
 the trapped particles can easily and hygienically from me 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.089
 not be deleted 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.089
 that is possible manually but also completely automatically 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.529
 The systems are easy to integrate into existing production line equipment 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.120
 is very reliable 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.760
 and requires hardly any maintenance a cow annual inspection is insufficient to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.499
 safeguard their production process 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.599
 the equipment meets the latest quality standards based on the latest 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.639
 European guidelines 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.929
 a few track versions are also possible 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.299
 systems based on the inspection with magnets as you have in this film 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.519
 can be designed and produced by smit gold gold 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.949
 systems bv 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.319
 a certified family business 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.319
 m active since 19 59 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.189
 the food industry is an important buyer 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.959
 from where a products are delivered and maintained worldwide 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 a certified workshops 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.719
 You would also like to know how to make metal detection more effective in the process 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.049
 can apply 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.079
 please contact one of the production this orphaned goldsmith 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.849
 I have systems 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.479
 9 we are happy to help you
