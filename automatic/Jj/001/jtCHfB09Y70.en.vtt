00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
do that we're gonna put a block on top

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.150 
do that we're gonna put a block on top
of<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.579> torch<00:00:57.000> move<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.350> away<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
of this torch move one away from that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270 
of this torch move one away from that
torch<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> build<00:01:00.199> six<00:01:01.199> blocks<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.980> mean<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
torch and build six blocks up I mean it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
torch and build six blocks up I mean it
doesn't<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.910> six<00:01:03.149> blocks<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.870> but

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
doesn't have to be six blocks up but

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
doesn't have to be six blocks up but
just<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> sake<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.220> I'm<00:01:05.549> building

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
just for the sake of time I'm building

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060 
just for the sake of time I'm building
mine<00:01:06.180> six<00:01:06.570> blocks<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:07.110> however<00:01:07.320> high<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.740> want

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
mine six blocks up however high you want

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.300 
mine six blocks up however high you want
your<00:01:08.310> elevator<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.000> build<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> high

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
your elevator you can build it that high

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
your elevator you can build it that high
okay<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.210> our<00:01:12.510> two<00:01:12.689> towers<00:01:13.110> six<00:01:13.439> feet

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
okay so we have our two towers six feet

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340 
okay so we have our two towers six feet
high<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.070> mean<00:01:14.310> six<00:01:14.580> blocks<00:01:14.880> high<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.140> put<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
high I mean six blocks high so we put a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
high I mean six blocks high so we put a
repeater<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.890> both<00:01:17.310> sides<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.479> mean<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.990> both

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
repeater on both sides I mean not both

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
repeater on both sides I mean not both
sides<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:19.979> side<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> block<00:01:21.540> on

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
sides just one side and then a block on

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.090 
sides just one side and then a block on
the<00:01:21.780> other<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:25.200> we're<00:01:25.320> gonna<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the other side so what we're gonna do is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
the other side so what we're gonna do is
kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.850> put<00:01:27.090> light<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.110> blocks<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
kind of put light put these blocks in a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
kind of put light put these blocks in a
zigzag<00:01:29.100> formation<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.900> corresponds

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
zigzag formation so that it corresponds

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.130 
zigzag formation so that it corresponds
to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.460> block<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:33.000> missing<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> other

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to the block that's missing on the other

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.039 
to the block that's missing on the other
side<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:36.119> we're<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> fill

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
side so what we're gonna do is fill

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.910 
side so what we're gonna do is fill
these<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:37.950> repeaters

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.109 

um<00:01:48.679> yeah<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.579> we're<00:01:50.759> gonna<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.090> some

um yeah so we're gonna put some

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.139 
um yeah so we're gonna put some
repeaters<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:52.109> there<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.759> got<00:01:53.909> their

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
repeaters right there so we got their

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
repeaters right there so we got their
repeaters<00:01:54.719> right<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.549> next<00:01:56.759> thing

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
repeaters right there so the next thing

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.870 
repeaters right there so the next thing
we're<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.619> we're<00:01:59.219> gonna<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.670> a

we're going to do is we're gonna put a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
we're going to do is we're gonna put a
block<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.929> block<00:02:00.959> here<00:02:01.649> now<00:02:02.159> we're

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
block here and a block here now we're

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
block here and a block here now we're
gonna<00:02:02.459> build<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.179> tower<00:02:03.539> leading<00:02:04.319> all<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.500> way

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.430 
at to the top on both of these so after
we're<00:02:09.060> done<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> fall<00:02:09.959> down<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
we're done with that fall down to the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.910 
we're done with that fall down to the
other<00:02:10.619> side<00:02:11.150> okay<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.420> now<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> back<00:02:13.380> what
