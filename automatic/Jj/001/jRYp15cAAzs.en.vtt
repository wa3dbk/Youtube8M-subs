00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hello everyone, my channel is mlp x5 and 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.769
 I hope you understand all of this. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.940
 tool stand hold video lesson 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.460
 how will i draw we lpm for this us 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.580
 need here such a tool and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 of course I don't know what it's called 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:33.120
 some fancy pencil and wash 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.739
 so start i take the biggest lap 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 who is in this circle 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:48.649
 so I drew this circle and now we 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.649
 do pub here 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.489
 why do you need these strips? 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.050
 later 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.680
 why should we draw half 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.100
 the circle 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.580
 here and well, so of course smaller 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.580
 draw some 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.910
 so I drew the hoof now to us 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.770
 need to draw 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.770
 torso idea 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.270
 so here again we must 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.270
 draw caputo 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:12.730
 my painted hooves and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:18.910
 for how will I have this earthly 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:22.870
 pony I will not draw and I do not robe and here 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.410
 so it happened and finally we 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.660
 moved to these two lines then for what 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.270
 they are needed 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:43.810
 Here is the line you do not need the ear of Tony 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 we make her her ear and here it is 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:54.010
 erase well, this strip is not strained but here I am 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.840
 erased he has strips 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:04.980
 well, except that and I can calmly draw 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.660
 and ear here and here we erase everything too 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.510
 I take all the glass too and stayed 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.650
 only one strip need this strip 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.930
 in order to make her wear this my 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.989
 the worst part of the picture is because 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.989
 but how do i do for pony is not very good 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.030
 but now I will try 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.709
 and here I drew her nose why I do not 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.629
 drew her nose on camera because 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.019
 it is inconvenient for me to draw 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:50.219
 two hands and so. 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:53.609
 and smile and here will be the eye 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:58.620
 well here of course you can draw loud 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:05.599
 I want to draw like this 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.599
 here are the hole blocks and 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.390
 we will not 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.130
 Here are the eyes get light cilia 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:52.400
 so and I know that the length is clear so that 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.400
 Well, I'll show you all the same 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:16.780
 Well, I remember her 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.639
 rain, I probably will not make a video 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.500
 so i do mane because all 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.039
 depends on your imagination you can 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:28.229
 come up with any there for example the mane here 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.229
 such here for example or some other 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.030
 don't know husband pack 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:00.510
 or so well it was a video lesson like me 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.340
 I draw on it until then pay back go 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.300
