00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so these like you said injection things

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.920 
so these like you said injection things
are<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.030> helpful

are really helpful

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.920 
are really helpful
probably<00:01:28.409> best<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.600> just<00:01:30.600> as

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
probably best way to go also just as

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
probably best way to go also just as
you're<00:01:31.200> playing<00:01:31.409> through<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> campaign<00:01:32.189> just

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you're playing through the campaign just

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.980

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
be picking stuff up for sure you know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
be picking stuff up for sure you know
that's<00:01:36.990> what's<00:01:37.229> good<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.280> all

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that's what's good this was good all

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.030 
that's what's good this was good all
right<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:39.810> rolling<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> last

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
right so we're rolling up on the last

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
right so we're rolling up on the last
couple<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.790> we're<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.119> finish<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
last I think it's hundred enemies before

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.620 
last I think it's hundred enemies before
you<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.229> achievement<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you get that achievement and that's a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.090 
you get that achievement and that's a
