00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 the interferences of earth of the planet 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.700
 It is more than 148 million kilometers 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 square 29.2 percent of those 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.710
 sizes the rest what occupy the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.900
 oceans 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.240
 Currently there are more than 7 million 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 inhabitants an immense burden for the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.039
 planet is estimated that by 2025 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.369
 we will be more than 9 million humans 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.930
 requiring resources to survive 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 environmental issue has never been a priority 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.369
 for humanity and the few 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 efforts and resources that are invested 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:44.220
 many of them are wasted in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:46.710
 meetings and assessments for 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.870
 global warming acidification 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 the seas deforestation of forests 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.170
 natural elimination of 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.160
 biodiversity of the planet 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 etcetera continued the efforts of the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.930
 observation have focused on the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 benefit of the human species and we have 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.300
 forgotten that the planet earth for more 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.380
 of 4 thousand 500 million years has known 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 in themselves we took hunts and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 illegal extractions continue in the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.620
 most national parks 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 the subject of our surveillance must be 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.660
 so in Africa in the year 2013 it 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.050
 they treated more than 465 rhinoceroses and more 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.280
 of 2500 elephants killed for their 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.280
 ivory and their bodies 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.260
 the national park lookout above are 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.260
 two lagoons 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 largest green in mesoamerica 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.050
 this father is my christmas have a 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:12.119
 number of animal species and mental 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.119
 public is the biological is intense 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.239
 in cultural wealth in what does 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.739
 doubly valuable and most 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.290
 It promotes the site a lot 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.040
 archaeological the best with a destination of 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.519
 interest of any great variety of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.400
 ecosystems we even found an area 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.920
 called the desert where the masters do not 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.920
 It can go more than 1.5 meters 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.840
 comment on five posts of 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.030
 control throughout the park what 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.430
 which makes it very vulnerable since after 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.200
 its size is necessary the installation of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.989
 at least three new posts 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.959
 you have three Carmelite accesses 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 washington and melchor from less than the side 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.989
 of guatemala in the north has access is 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.379
 by character and by black stream of 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.379
 Mexico 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.420
 the threats are present within the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.420
 Park 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:28.580
 the national park is the most medical 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.520
 great from mexico 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.520
 this is the heart of the mornings
