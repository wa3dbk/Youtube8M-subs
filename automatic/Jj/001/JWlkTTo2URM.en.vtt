00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
anything like this well actually maybe

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.000 
anything like this well actually maybe
once<00:00:49.239> and<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.600> reason<00:00:49.960> why<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.409> that<00:00:50.739> once

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
once and the reason why that that once

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.860 
once and the reason why that that once
it<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.370> because<00:00:51.909> inspiration<00:00:52.600> for<00:00:52.720> this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
it is because inspiration for this

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.920 
it is because inspiration for this
series<00:00:53.140> was<00:00:53.500> taken<00:00:53.949> from<00:00:54.129> marius<00:00:54.670> her<00:00:55.360> set<00:00:55.720> I
