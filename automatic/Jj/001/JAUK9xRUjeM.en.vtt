00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 but 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:14.980
 I do not know for me the skin makes me bad very 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.570
 I do not know if it 's true they 're going to see 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.050
 very good this care what we are going to do 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.170
 the rockers will see very well let's see 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.720
 first the list of material 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.800
 for the necklace with skin we need 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.349
 leather or imitation leather scissors chain 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.349
 clasp for collar rivet 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.899
 I already catch because it puts you wrong it's about 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.730
 the skin gets you upset badly by 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.730
 that of the leather as 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.630
 then we will measure 13 centimeters 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.730
 for 6 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.190
 and then we turn in this case is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.540
 imitation 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.550
 and from the corro for one you are me 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.550
 or we can also do with the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.040
 I do not know 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 but in this case, I do not know, it's not going to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.060
 see that part then marked 13 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.060
 centimeters and 6 in width 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.659
 and what we are going to do is cut back a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.659
 rectangle 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.130
 subtract 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.390
 let's cut out exactly the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.290
 rectangle that is going to be the necklace 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.480
 that we want along the neck and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.900
 the truth I think that if they were 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.080
 saving a good wool does not put anything 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.610
 since we have it we are going to make a mark 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.340
 mark the strips but to these and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.500
 complete to cut them as is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.190
 a centimeter of separation less if they are 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 like a centimeter 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.990
 and there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.540
 Very soft can also be done at 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.250
 grope but better so we can be 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.070
 more accurate 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750
 and it's important to leave about 23 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.890
 centimeters on top for 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.080
 that does not break our 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.080
 our necklace we mark ourselves 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.770
 and these will be 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.090
 make a necklace type these jackets 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.570
 sling skin will feel very cowboy a 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.570
 world 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.300
 then we start to cut between each 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.920
 one of the strips we made 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.140
 and I really think that this could also 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.720
 be a very good business people buy 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.550
 quite expensive then what are accessories 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.220
 and the truth is that practically 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.590
 we all choose 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.870
 fantasy jewelry 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.019
 the truth is worth the design and that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.420
 you can spend less and changing has 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.250
 invested in something very expensive that good 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.980
 for women we also like it but 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.599
 good is more difficult or maybe better 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.489
 you're tired of you getting to the 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.180
 breakfast and someone brings the same 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.370
 accessory that tc then what better than 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.379
 so you can make your own 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.300
 accessories in this case we have this 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.480
 pin 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.550
 what is a clamp besides rivet 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.550
 then we do here 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.470
 all building 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.629
 and we already have two holes one in each 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.600
 on each side and we have around here this is 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.240
 the rivet are the rivets but look at me 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.400
 I'll show you why I went ahead 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.400
 just this is the idea that we give it 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.170
 not completely to leave a part in 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.990
 the one that is going to sustain and that is going to 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.840
 sustain and that is going to see then the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.430
 chain and if you want like this with all this 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.910
 that you have left because you put on a miniskirt 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.420
 I also do the dance to the husband 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.270
 of the deer there is a loincloth 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.530
 could also do then what 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.520
 let's do is since we have the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.259
 hole we put the rivet 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.259
 and with the same clamps 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.140
 we push 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.310
 and if you fix this, it makes the auction 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.740
 open and press the fabric 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:44.720
 we do same 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.720
 I am the king of the machin 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.810
 since we have more chile 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.330
 placed we are going to join it with this chain 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.970
 and the closure that in this case we choose 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.040
 they are very practical because nothing more 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.550
 serious naughty goes through ready 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.140
 and it comes in handy for the necklace that 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.030
 we are doing these with the clamp 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.030
 let's just join them 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.019
 that we could use this today we can use 

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:22.460
 This is a little wider than the 

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:25.630
 same that brings 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.110
 here is I am here also putting 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.110
 for the next 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:38.989
 that we can open to the assets of that 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.989
 side but why do not you take mine 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:49.009
 they leave me what used there does not want a 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:54.169
 new as yours looks at names 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:59.139
 I want you to put it on with this 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.139
 magnificent without this nation tell anyone 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:09.810
 people come very well is father not 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.340
 quite pretty with clear and final and 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.890
 because we can make more designs some 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.930
 long forms more returned nothing like 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.390
 like more choker maybe more 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.320
 tight look that seems very good 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:28.790
 super ambience plus good idea plans 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.790
 so I have some boots and more vivas not 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:36.169
 but do not let me live is not at the expense of 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.940
 that the necklace better let's see this 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.670
 Step by Step 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.740
 by way of elaboration takes the measure of 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.170
 leather approximately 13 x 6 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.930
 centimeters cuts strips on the leather with 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.610
 spaces of approximately 3 millimeters 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.230
 at each end for a rivet or a 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.540
 perforation so you see the same as is the 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.730
 chain for the short chain two 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.380
 sections of 10 centimeters each in 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.000
 each end places a brooch so that 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.000
 close the collar and it will be ready 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:09.140
 I'm already finishing yours so that 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.140
 there is no zeal, there is conflict 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.160
 you have to make it martÃ­nez aspar 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:26.660
 Well, what do you think if while 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.660
 we are still here fantasizing a cut
