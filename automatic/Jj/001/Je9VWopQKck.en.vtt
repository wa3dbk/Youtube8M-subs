00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello and welcome thanks for the 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.150
 tuning this time I bring you a 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.760
 Rice for Samsung Galaxy S 39.300 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.980
 this track we have installed previously 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.600
 in this channel but with the version of 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.850
 android and the living this time its 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.910
 developer has updated this rom to 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.039
 android 4.4 by all removes to put the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.109
 I have installed in this terminal 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.300
 a week ago and I did not notice any problems 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.189
 so I recommend it to you 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.380
 install the files you will leave I will leave them 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.700
 in the description of the video and only 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.340
 you download it and copy it your memory 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.830
 microsd you can also change 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 the kernel like this time I'll 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.309
 change the kernel because I noticed a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 a slight battery consumption and I opted for 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 install him the tender people of that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
 I will also leave you in the description of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.120
 video if you want to change it as we can 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 observe let's go into the drawer of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 applications we will notice that in the case of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.210
 application we will find some 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.040
 native applications of cyanogenmod as 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.470
 also incorporates some functions of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.760
 union as you can see here the omi 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.640
 suite we can also 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.650
 see them and notes and some other 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.290
 applications that come incorporated the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.940
 rom this is rom is like before 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.620
 I told you pure android which will give you 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.350
 more fluency performance to the terminal 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.390
 we center the information of the telephone 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.020
 we can see here the details of 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.110
 Rice channel is based on a round 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.380
 of topics 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.210
 for him is that the base rom of this rom and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.820
 As you can see here, it leaves us 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.800
 developer is miguel the moon and we 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 leave the address on htc handcuffs where 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.730
 We can ask the questions to get 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.650
 answers about jar rice 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.180
 It can be customized to your liking as 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.280
 can observe here comes with some 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.500
 functions that have added as they can 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.600
 see the halo theme that are many 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.330
 they ask if it brings some rice installed in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.800
 this channel if you bring that function as 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.180
 you can see here this block of 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.340
 customization and we can 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.380
 customize each one of us as 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.619
 we like it better 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.350
 some in some games more than everything 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.360
 proven in this rally that I already know 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 I 'll show you let's see what are the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.830
 graphs now below 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.310
 even though we have this terminal that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.590
 with a rom is not official, so look 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.020
 it works correctly we do not have no 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.760
 we are slow in what is the time of 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.420
 load the graphics as we can 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 observe here 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.440
 the truth that the samsung galaxy s3 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.270
 it's a good terminal, the really me 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.950
 I am delighted with this device and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.170
 which has a boche lens performance 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.930
 as it also has been what the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.180
 rom that are being developed for 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.400
 him since those are good not everything is 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.870
 update it but that's why there are the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.720
 from other developers other cooks 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.550
 that always save us at the time of 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.630
 the updates now going to try 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.580
 this rom with this game we will be 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.780
 here we go skiing we will be like 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.780
 load it fast to not 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 let's lower the volume because we do not 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.760
 skip what are notifications 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.750
 can see me for the games because almost 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.630
 I'm not very good 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.490
 I just want to do in the demonstration that 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.070
 It works very well 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.000
 the rom with the games of these with the 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.000
 graphics and everything 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.010
 we will also incorporate in this community 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.420
 sections and this game but 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.100
 really now what I'm doing is 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.540
 testing the rom with the graphics because 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.360
 Many of you like what you like 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.530
 is the games and they will like to have a 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.460
 rom is stable to be able to use it 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.820
 what is the good graphics of the game 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.230
 well this is what the rom 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.150
 let's see what the bar is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 been as you can see these are the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.690
 quick configurations and we have them 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.100
 best of the norm will appear here the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.830
 notifications and if not then we want 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.260
 directly access the settings 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.030
 well we access this side well this 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.560
