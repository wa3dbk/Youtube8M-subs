00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.010
 Good morning, this is a job for control. 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.110
 of peacemaking that he has been developing. 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.270
 printed on coated paper to be transferred 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.680
 and even a transfer to that card 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.330
 elite final 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.220
 this process will be shown because 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.350
 would greatly increase video time and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.640
 interesting here is to show the drive your 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.559
 operation 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.180
 probably in the next video not 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.320
 shows how this process 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.780
 transfer 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.239
 so now I'm going to cut and after 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.720
 complete the transfer process and the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.269
 vote with video in the construction of our 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.000
 brief and subdivide the steps so that 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.629
 everyone can see here is the impression 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.199
 on the coated paper the impression was passed 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.500
 for this board and even many references 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:03.489
 right after the second plate was removed 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.409
 excess of war material and 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:12.520
 finally the point where the 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:27.340
 and placing the components is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:29.980
 compound of 16 29 and 41 normal and it is 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.500
 linking motor motto 17 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.550
 this engine is relatively small by 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.530
 This is not happening and I wish 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:53.640
 put a larger engine I recommend that 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:02:01.240
 I used yellow sinks 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:08.590
 those responsible for the movement of the engine 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:11.650
 if both have been turned on and locked 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.080
 if any of the two have dropped 0 volts and 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.670
 back to 5 engine takes a step in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.379
 counterclockwise or counterclockwise 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 depending on which of the two do action 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.770
 and if both fall to zero or say 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.990
 the engine is off 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:43.440
 now let's take a look at the engine 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:54.200
 cast by rotating to one side to the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:54.200
 other changing the speed 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.880
 I hope you keep this video and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.880
 Thank you for watching.
