00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.390

 of course it is again tons 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.630
 hasty and it is about skyrim what 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:19.560
 yes, the whole world is crucial as only 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 discovered elder scrolls 5 something 2011 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 somehow been published 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 yes and suddenly discovered the world is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.430
 I mean, I also bought it in my shop 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 steam summer I think that's the one too 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 reason why all youtube gamer that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.100
 new and like let's play so part 1 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.180
 what will happen i dont know 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.520
 absolute feeble-minded teacher's there 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.590
 Now skyrim is known as 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 all of the games which are pretty many 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.850
 Watts has you have already extremely 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.840
 many watts in the other pictures 120 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.340
 active yes you have 120 must be active 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 the ottens probably there to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 to count the other place or what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.570
 no matter how many modder teams work 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.129
 currently at probably the biggest scott ever 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.660
 be on states and to all eight 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 Landkammer gradually let go 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.640
 the whole team gets implemented 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 Now we have now on na 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 that's the whole world, so to speak 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.580
 consists of eight countries just to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 For example, 2006 countries are also from 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 oblivion and are actually white no 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:29.280
 no and look is planning euro deal 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.970
 more precisely, everything is the opposite 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.159
 dollar in front 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.170
 yes, exactly the individual teams consists of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.060
 up to 20 modern looks after the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.520
 implementation of various areas despite 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.990
 and quests on the basis that is the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 farmers not only the shit with you 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.430
 that still makes the fucking content 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.810
 because only as main problems gave because 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.689
 the physics and so on with the engine 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.850
 few bugs and so on mid 2014 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.990
 Everything ready 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.180
 holy shit so pleased, of course 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.009
 on it because the game is not so long 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.290
 he knows enough that it is her own 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.210
 not by not completely 1000 percent 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.680
 but as often as 90 or so the cost 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.960
 of a course I've only times 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.430
 The headache starts all over 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.750
 Giant more price how can I get there 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.489
 towards and as far as I build like a whole 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.259
 hour until I'm ever ridden 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.350
 before he found out that one 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.920
 pure at any time 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.020
 yes, yes, yes , like 50 years 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.510
 billion hectares to the with is the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.170
 God why I am already located 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.070
 not or we are investing on yes 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.690

 What you're saying is still playing 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.810
 skyrim we like to look at siding 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.850
 To belong to a team is done a short time 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 until the flight of her device was the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.720
 stupid bitch could not kill 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.560
