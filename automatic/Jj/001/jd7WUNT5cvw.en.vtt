you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:23.000> but<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.150> am<00:00:24.390> instead<00:00:24.779> gonna<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.199> doing

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you know but I am instead gonna be doing

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
you know but I am instead gonna be doing
the<00:00:25.859> Saltine<00:00:26.310> challenge<00:00:26.539> where<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.810> actually

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the Saltine challenge where it actually

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.390 
the Saltine challenge where it actually
sounds<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.650> easy<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> haven't<00:00:29.220> seen

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
sounds really easy but I haven't seen

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.139 
sounds really easy but I haven't seen
anyone<00:00:29.640> finish<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:31.019> guess<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.740> but

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
anyone finish it so I guess it's not but

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
anyone finish it so I guess it's not but
like<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.329> guessing<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.960> makes<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.410> mouth

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
like I'm guessing it makes your mouth

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.580 
like I'm guessing it makes your mouth
really<00:00:34.980> dry<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.360> can't<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.840> digest<00:00:37.350> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
really dry and you can't like digest it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.790 
really dry and you can't like digest it
or<00:00:37.710> whatever<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:39.260> what's<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.649> mouth

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
