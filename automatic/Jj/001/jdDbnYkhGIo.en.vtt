00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.530
 give 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.770
 but 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.140
 welcome everyone with you fibrin and today 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 I do not usually such a video on 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.850
 I decided to make skyrim 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.030
 which passes on my channel because 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.129
 that but he is a little bit out of our 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.930
 proper atmospheric passage a 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.070
 I will be here directly 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.340
 task 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.220
 get chests from holesy blacksmiths 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.570
 hidden chests that are so simply not 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.420
 find me hinted at them one of 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.730
 subscribers in the comments I wondered 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.600
 yourself aiming to get them though so not you 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.369
 so simple 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.700
 it is not too difficult if you approach 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.820
 this wisely 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.630
 now let's go directly to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.509
 performing the task itself and so here we are 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.030
 We are in a hotel in the smithy and for that 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 to get to the chests we need 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.930
 get over the lava over there 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.340
 which column to see 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.200
 you can actually go through the words 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.539
 one in one simple way applying 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.420
 cry incorporeity unfortunately me he 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.219
 only slightly developed there alone 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 on one word embedded in it therefore it 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.909
 ends very quickly on therefore 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.429
 I have to actually use 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.899
 islands that wait on them all this 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.429
 business but as you can see the result is 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.170
 I have to often enough 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.390
 do quite often use 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.950
 islets because if you cry 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.329
 will be developed overall totally then you 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.539
 I can think much faster 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.340
 get to one place or another 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.160
 or else it was the first chest 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.599
 I have to go back to the island 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.030
 and through 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.000
 islet further as you see now 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.560
 in front of me the gate behind them can be found 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.299
 one more must be said that this one 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.610
 the chest that he just took out with 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.130
 most interesting there for you by level 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470
 will fall treasures betray changing 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.260
 inspired but for me tick them too 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.970
 got there 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.860
 ten people are not the gate and now these 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.590
 gates do not open not locked 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.450
 open quite easily but you need 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.670
 be careful because they can you 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.689
 just drop during opening 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.079
 back chapter 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.200
 moreover when you open them there 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.519
 can not be here on this little 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.349
 little piece of land which is located 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.750
 gateways can not stand there and you 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.260
 devour at once too and therefore it is necessary 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.659
 immediately move further inland 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.040
 this passage to take place there 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.400
 comfortable but even using the same cry 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.440
 we make our way forward 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970
 one more little chest 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:22.310
 As you can see, in general, everything is enough 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:26.450
 wistfully here here we go back 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.540
 again a series of blacksmith well, because not so 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.250
 it is difficult if you approach it wisely 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.750
 business is nice to you 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.290
 number of lives you can at least 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.710
 some 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.910
 a few seconds over the lava to stand in 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.980
 lava to stand more correctly one more 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.410
 a group of chests is behind those 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.540
 the gate to the right there comes to me too 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.400
 ribber from wading through the islet 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.650
 because I tried unfortunately on 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.590
 Iâ€™m not alone with this cry 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.370
 manage to get to the gate 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.900
 do not have time to die 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 I just run out faster 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.220
 life and this straw 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 a little faster 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.890
 how do we get to it now again 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.770
 same fishy view of the gatehouse with the gate they 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.480
 strongly push you back into the lava and 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.989
 here you can transfer 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:24.590
 your property is already over 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:27.050
 the words we have density me practically 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.870
 not pumped went as far as passing 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.720
 I mostly do not use it so here here 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.550
 one more chest in it 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.200
 junk but also not very golden 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.990
 a necklace a scroll of general then on this 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.800
 to cash in a little bit 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.680
 there are no more chests here 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.840
 as far as I can remember, you can 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.480
 go back further interview 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.700
 blacksmith on this basically everything 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.630
 ends i hope it will be you 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.800
 useful in your game can also 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.660
 get chests get out of them 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.360
 anything useful enough especially 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.100
 work at a high level up from 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.260
 pumped cry hollowness is 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.520
 will be easy enough and on this on 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.200
