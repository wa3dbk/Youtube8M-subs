00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 now at the return of the cut we are going to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.220
 to be reading but you have something to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.220
 show me something interesting or something to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.440
 show them very interesting what happened 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.110
 in Copenhagen because you do not have 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.450
 transportation problems the apartment 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 Of course, what happens here in a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.340
 ordered society and notice what 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.820
 it happens on the subway in copenhagen the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.470
 people were ready to go up if everything is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.480
 ready that nothing would be wrong because 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 as it is in some collective units 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.910
 people could do well as well as a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.910
 Relaxation 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.890
 but not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:59.550
 to people listening 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.770
 so travel is still not done 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.549
 well because there the trips are 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.549
 Pleasant 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.549
 plus 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:40.979
 it is a attraction of espn 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.610
 changes the mood that changes the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 humor be that you are doing the work 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.399
 is moving house and you find yourself or you 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.700
 you come across this orchestra is also a 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.240
 Total relaxation in this case should not go 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.100
 house by house for by so that people 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.929
 when you do not have collectives good so 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.179

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.179
