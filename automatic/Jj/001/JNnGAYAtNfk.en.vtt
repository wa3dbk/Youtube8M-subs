00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 all the rays of good with you mayor and in this 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.319
 video we'll talk about joint battles a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.510
 rather it will be so small 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 instructions for them that is, I will tell you how 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 go there that they themselves 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 represent in general everything about them and so here 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.720
 these joint fights involves 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.500
 the interaction of two kinds of troops as you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.689
 understand this aviation and ground equipment 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 now teams will have to distribute 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 forces between two tasks 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.050
 the capture of ground points and air 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.600
 support of advancing tanks and here 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.790
 It is important to say that while in these Arcadia 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 no fights these fights are available only in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 realistic and simulator us modes but 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 it's only for now 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.610
 and now with regard to technology in these 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.730
 battles you can use one 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.460
 plane and one tank plane reborn 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.739
 cannot as you understand the century we have 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.199
 normal randomness in aircraft battles more precisely 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.239
 air we can not be reborn a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 Here on the tank everything will be according to the standard 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.829
 there is like in tank battles without airplanes 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 you can be reborn that number of times 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.090
 which is allowed for selected cars in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.580
 depending on the class, that is, that is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100
 for tyazh once that is once we 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.130
 can appear for medium two and so 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.890
 further attention if the hangar is selected 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.960
 only tanks or airplanes only then you 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.900
 you can only get to fight 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 plane well or on one tank therefore 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.820
 it is recommended to have mixed sets 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.330
 technicians of the required rank by the way about 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.579
 ranks 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.530
 and balancing as players can 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.420
 decide on what technique to go to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 the battle after it began, that is, we 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 first in the hangar we collect the setup from 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 tanks and aircraft go into battle and in battle 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.170
 already deciding to fly out on some 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.960
 plane or go to any tanks 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 so the principle of balancing will be similar 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 With arcade battles, that is, the calculation will be 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.820
 take the technique of the highest level 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.040
 of all the crews selected in the slots this 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.020
 Of course a brief wording if you want 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.119
 better understand how it works 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.670
 arcade balancer you can see 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.710
 developer diaries about it now 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.130
 As for the choice of setups here it is necessary 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 be more attentive 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.720
 if you have a square-1c gun l-11 and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.970
 attack aircraft Il-2 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.340
 years of their combat rating like that and that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.920
 another 30 then with them is not worth it 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.450
 insert slot Mig-15 bis battle 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.250
 rated 8 and 3 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.010
 otherwise you will just be thrown into battle 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.810
 high level and then on apt-1 you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.019
 will have to fight with the royal 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.519
 tigers and panthers and the most important i 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.680
 I did not say how to get into these 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.750
 joint would and in general everything is simple here 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.060
 Asad about the fire told you so 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.250
 choose your setup from airplanes and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.560
 tanks were only from aircraft if you 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.720
 just want a dirt road to bomb well or 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.940
 only from tanks if you only want 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.880
 on the tanks to go to the general chose 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.000
 open tank battles press the button 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.910
 fight all you queue in joint battles 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.319
 and little information about 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.810
 arcade joint fighting as you could 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.750
 notice i only said realistic and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.660
 simulator ducks here in comparison zbt 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.069
 Waiting for us in arcade joint battles 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.680
 profound changes 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.040
 so they will definitely be these 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 fighting but later they will be well, that and I 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.959
 that's all with you was mr hopefully 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.549
