00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
slight chance of that anyway this is a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.179

view<00:01:08.220> through<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> valley<00:01:09.380> we're<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
view through the valley we're in the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
view through the valley we're in the
clouds<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> moment<00:01:11.939> though<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.570> much

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
clouds at the moment though not much

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
we're climbing up there again not a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.350 
we're climbing up there again not a
crepe<00:01:16.080> eehhh<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> hopefully<00:01:17.880> above<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
crepe eehhh so hopefully above the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.530 
crepe eehhh so hopefully above the
clouds<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.650> better<00:01:19.860> view

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
clouds there will be a better view

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.080

population<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:21.900> our<00:01:22.110> island<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
population we get off our island the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.429 
population we get off our island the
reaches<00:01:24.420> closer<00:01:24.659> than<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> walk<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> bit

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
reaches closer than I like to walk a bit

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.609 
reaches closer than I like to walk a bit
so<00:01:25.650> we're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> thinking<00:01:26.640> somehow

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
so we're going to do a thinking somehow

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
so we're going to do a thinking somehow
luckily<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:29.610> found<00:01:29.750> an<00:01:30.750> alternative<00:01:31.290> rethink

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
luckily we found an alternative rethink

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.210 
luckily we found an alternative rethink
