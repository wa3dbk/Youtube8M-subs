00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 but these sugar canes have 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 something strange 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 my god legatre of minecraft ways are 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.820
 piece and today I'm here to introduce you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 a new fashion , fashion or freezes gable 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.449
 force mod 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 let's start immediately let's see what's there 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.460
 introduces this new fashion this new one 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.410
 fashion introduces us to details 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 sugar canes instead of that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 find us sugar or whatever we say 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.660
 sugar cane is found gods 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 minerals how it works then let's go to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.760
 see them there are several variations of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.950
 these sugar canes as you see 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.160
 they are growing they bring us a little bit 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.160
 however, if they grow it is the thing 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.500
 interesting what is the interesting thing 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.539
 this fashion compatibility with maud like 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 the town kraft is the industry and many 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.710
 others therefore we have the possibility of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 also get for example richard che 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 they are the minerals of the town kraft or 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 copper teen uranium however any 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.070
 type of mineral introduced by the fashions 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 with which we have the compatibility we go to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.220
 see what all these introduces us 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.080
 reader who are these types of rods from 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 sugar that seem to be airon 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 bars have the possibility to do one 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 nice thing i show you can 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.750
 be kraft to you they are practically created 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.729
 all the same way ie rods from 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.280
 stone sugar and the material in the center 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 so true for iron the gold lapis 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.759
 hammond and then here they begin a moment 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 the variants that is lag the stone that there 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.200
 kraft in this way the klein 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.110
 this other obsidian in this other 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 emerald in this other and finally in eder 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 in this one, however, the thing 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.530
 interesting just because york can 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.659
 grow can be tart now 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 I'll show you how to grow not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.130
 they need the usual sand but 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.340
 grooming bloc that kraft in this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.170
 way it is very simple a little bit 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.800
 expensive, that is, it costs a little bit though 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.230
 come on it's simple dirt with marco alboni 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.930
 thousand on boats 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.390
 a ironing the red son lapis gold e 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.400
 finally diamond what we do 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.890
 positions i love her we expect that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.019
 they grow so we say useful 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.970
 make very large farms for them 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.530
 grow faster 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.879
 what we do now we find ourselves a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.030
 moment the creative that I show you 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.950
 once we are here we dig because 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.810
 we should do it with dpj cakes if 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.660
 it doesn't take an eternity and I'm afraid that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.299
 don't break look in fact we have 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.019
 necessarily need the diamont peak ex 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.810
 that we drop at this ride so equal 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.480
 but now what we do then there are 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.090
 three variants those with the airon ones 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.040
 with the lapis and those with the red son se 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.829
 lara stone we just use a 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.140
 read to give us a redstone if 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.290
 we use online or any other 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.000
 material we should use 8 then 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.519
 it costs a little more but I will 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.519
 I remember that in the end a total gain 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.260
 for the lapis instead 4 are enough then 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.459
 if for example we can use the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.720
 diamond in this way as the airon 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.380
 or quartz 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.440
 in this way it is not true 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:29.419
 I was joking I wasn't joking 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.889
 wait ok ok 4 so some are not there 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.870
 not even registered on the site so you have to 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.079
 a moment to see them anyway 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.720
 combinations are 418 you have to try them 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.370
 you because I don't know it anyway either 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.840
 all are on the site 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.540
 among the examples, however, I have seen which 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.010
 leading fashion and still say 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.049
 this you see of his while I was 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.299
 speaking has also grown a lot of airon 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.549
 but very useful because I tell you useful 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.150
 because maybe in the technical pac this 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.030
 mode can serve indeed it is very useful if 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.889
 we want to have so few resources 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.340
 time is a little no because first we have to 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.669
 find them anyway we say that you are one 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.169
 good thing because in the end with time 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:13.069
 if we play a lot in mode tech 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:15.139
 the revenue will be greater than the expenditure vi 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.940
 remember to put 250 I like the 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.560
 publish to a new video if I can today 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.289
 even three are published, but I believe 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.000
 two they succeed and we always serve the 250 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.420
 I like it so you have to do it 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.250
 subscribe to the channel first 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.200
