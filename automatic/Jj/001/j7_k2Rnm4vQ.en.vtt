00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.360
 hello everybody lost 4000 years 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.890
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.980
 leave the map on need for speed 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 world then the blick game is here 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.600
 Not that he actually is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 retreated into the barrier until a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 precise place and press the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 delete key then you go 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 normally go through the barrier 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.620
 would be right because finally enter go in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.940
 your hideout come out it does 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.239
 Normally you can center of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.180
 Mark 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.739
 I want to do it with you we put 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.199
 like this where I advise to put a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 foot on them 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.449
 otherwise you do not see too well when 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.930
 you do like me you step back 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.930
 against the wall 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.530
 I have a little advice to the wells on 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.490
 will watch that your rearview mirror and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.840
 bailly he's pretty much there and less of that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.890
 walk every time so does 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.350
 maybe there something near fall 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.340
 in a class apart hatem separable 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.340
 must start again 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.650
 after a while it will work so 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.580
 have to drill I do it just now 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:43.060
 so here is one that is successful brief you 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:45.100
 go to your hideout you're out 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.520
 and you will be like that I have for 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.880
 back at Yves afloat that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.680
 I call to make a master vauxrot like 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.560
 you have to actually otherwise you will do 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.640
 loops and uncontrollable that's the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.310
 exit of the machine need for speed 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.000
 world can do them all you 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.950
 want here and so now I'm going 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.689
 to show a nice little thing that is 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.660
 cantoned in out of max united thought 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.040
 must have to keep until then just 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.080
 here roughly in the map 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 so I'll go through the side because 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.640
 that otherwise there is the yard gates and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.560
 about it blocks I think I'm becoming 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.830
 more logona at least I think you're going 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.610
 go under the sea one under the water I 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 really needed shit 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.950
 we'll get there soon I'll get you 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.990
 show like his mom here with a 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.090
 kind of small circle and from there 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.090
 here we go to the north 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.240
 and then 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.650
 you're going to get that to the hideout 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.650
 in fact in your hideout 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.420
 Serbian No. 81 must stick the bar 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.420
 option 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.330
 look at the car has all weird 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.390
 keep that's it the famous circle is there 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.530
 the car cif well not have them 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.780
 teeth we could see the colors 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.870
 normal that they were all wearing everything at 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.870
 North 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.760
 and normally down you'll see that's it 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.760
 the board after where are these 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.270
 and you end up in your 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.340
 hiding that and that's your thing you 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.240
 can not go far, but that's it 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.140
 it's still your plant could 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.150
 to be witty here it was benji 4001 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.700
 for 1.2 or solid game match for his 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.080
 rights more then I have not them during 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.900
 the video but I will try to send 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.400
 this video to the so-called shocked do in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.050
 hoping that he clauds him and thanks to them
