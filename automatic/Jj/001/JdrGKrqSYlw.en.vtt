it is now just remember that macbook air
is<00:02:02.530> not<00:02:02.710> designed<00:02:03.039> for<00:02:03.160> heavy<00:02:03.340> tasks<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.509> if

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
is not designed for heavy tasks so if

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.670 
is not designed for heavy tasks so if
you<00:02:04.750> want<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:04.990> use<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.229> macbook<00:02:05.530> air<00:02:05.649> for

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680

thing<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.110> be<00:02:11.140> demonstrating<00:02:11.800> today<00:02:11.890> is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
thing I can be demonstrating today is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.520 
thing I can be demonstrating today is
boot<00:02:12.489> time<00:02:12.760> now<00:02:13.510> because<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.050> solid<00:02:14.350> state

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
