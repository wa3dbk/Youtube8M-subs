00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.200 
that but the guitars and saxophones just
kind<00:06:21.320> of<00:06:21.409> pop<00:06:22.039> into<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.490> song<00:06:22.729> whenever<00:06:23.090> they

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
kind of pop into the song whenever they

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.520 
kind of pop into the song whenever they
feel<00:06:23.419> like<00:06:23.539> they're<00:06:23.750> not<00:06:23.780> getting<00:06:24.440> enough

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
feel like they're not getting enough

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.649 
feel like they're not getting enough
attention<00:06:25.099> when<00:06:25.250> it<00:06:25.460> comes<00:06:25.729> to<00:06:25.970> bringing<00:06:26.389> a

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
attention when it comes to bringing a

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.659 
attention when it comes to bringing a
broad<00:06:26.930> spectrum<00:06:27.289> of<00:06:27.710> instruments<00:06:28.400> into<00:06:28.550> a

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
broad spectrum of instruments into a

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.540 
broad spectrum of instruments into a
loaf<00:06:29.000> i<00:06:29.360> recording<00:06:30.050> style<00:06:30.380> which<00:06:30.800> I<00:06:31.039> think<00:06:31.430> has

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550
