00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.970
 to the girls that I hope you are 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.410
 great last monday was my birthday 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.070
 and I will take you with me while I 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.320
 I prepare 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.910
 and the first thing I do is throw my 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.860
 moisturizer and it's super super 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.480
 essential for me to get moisturizing 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.849
 always before putting makeup 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.590
 because I have super dry skin and if not 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.240
 I put on cream after I put on 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.070
 makeup base but it starts to 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.359
 be patches and it looks horrible like that 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.189
 that I wear the one that gives me so much in the 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.779
 neck and in the face and then esparto 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.789
 my normal makeup base as I do 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.800
 always with my fingers and then I 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.230
 esparto well with mega blew well with 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.150
 my sponge and for the eyes I'm going to 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.610
 use the naked palette 2 that gives it to me 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.559
 my husband for my birthday and I'm 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.450
 using a dark super nice brown 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.219
 and I'm going to leave you photos anyway 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.750
 so you can see the colors well in 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.090
 I'm putting it super close to 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 eyelashes above and super close to 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.989
 tabs below 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.680
 I really like this technique 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.510
 Makeup better than putting shadows 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.129
 of dark clear of the lacrimal towards 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.860
 outside I like to put myself in the shade 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.449
 dark on the entire eyelid near the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.920
 tabs both up and down and 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.930
 then continue in color lighter color 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.369
 so I'm using a brown plus 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.220
 clearly I also leave you a photo 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.470
 and blur and you know how important it is 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.509
 is to blur and I when I learned to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.070
 blur the makeup world too 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.780
 it's completely for me because before 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.020
 the shadows I was super apart is 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.369
 horrible and nothing is blur blur 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.520
 blur and try not to be left 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.680
 visible lines between your skin and the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 shadow so blur the super 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 essential 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.070
 at the time of putting the same shadow 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.750
 brown clarita that I have thrown in the part 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.579
 from above I'm going to put it right in the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.890
 bottom part on top of the color that I 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.409
 you have cast before and at the beginning 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.500
 to fill in the eyebrows as I always do 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.610
 I'm using a brown pencil and the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.470
 truth is that it has not been a long time 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.570
 used normally for all 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.799
 days I liked more with dust but I 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.360
 realized that it does not leave my eyebrows 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.590
 super dark so it started to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
 use it again and I like how 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.509
 it remains and nothing I fill them with the pencil 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.080
 and then I blew the color 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.750
 with the brush that is now using the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.060
 mascara and many many layers of mascara 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.980
 as I always say if he knew how to put me 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.049
 false eyelashes I would put them but the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.610
 it's true that I'm horrible putting myself 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.370
 so I prefer to throw myself a thousand layers 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.349
 of mascara and that's it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.819
 and I use mascara on my eyelashes 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.819
 up like the tabs below 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.909
 ok now we go with bronzer the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.709
 processor is super special in my 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.269
 makeup routine every day not 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.810
 I can leave the house without a sunscreen 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.880
 love to wear the face super brunette 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.440
 even in winter I love to go all 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.360
 the brunette year so the tan is 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.190
 super essential in fact makeup 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.500
 some die on the cheekbones on the bridge 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.780
 of the nose on the forehead on the chin 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.489
 and try the same blur blur to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.870
 that there are no visible lines between the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.410
 color that I just tossed in the base 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.410
 of makeup 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.090
 to finish I'm using a color 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.000
 very nice burgundy that is a Vaseline 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.380
 I also leave a picture I put it 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.870
 little touches to make it look much more 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.950
 natural and it's now I'm going to go to 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.569
 put on my clothes until later 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.790
 and I'm obsessed with putting myself 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.440
 broken pants both long and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.420
 shorts is an obsession that I have now 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.910
 for the summer I do not know why it's worth 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.950
 Now I put on my watch, he gave it to me 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.780
 this husband gave it to me my husband for san 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.330
 valentine is from michael kors and I love it 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.510
 I wear it every day my ring 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.650
 married and then my two rings one that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.599
 my mother has given me and the other 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.390
 dizzy my cousin 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.450
 some from afghanistan and others from colombia and 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.910
 I love 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.580
 and now with the hair I sleep all the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.410
 nights with my hair down and as soon as I 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.030
 I raise I make a bow whenever I 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.129
 I'm home from the top down I have 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.470
 a bow placed because it is so much better 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.050
 when I get it when I let it go I do not have 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.420
 no pigtail mark or anything and I 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.650
 leaves the waves very pretty so that 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.229
 is my trick to always keep the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.820
 wavy hair and it's already back to me 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.079
 center that is like more we will not take 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.260
 hair 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.420
 and it is already 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.280
 and this is the final look I've put on 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.980
 sandals like my mother's year 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.740
 past that I think they are from the facelift and 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.970
 They are super comfortable and I hope that I have 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.840
 liked the video and see you in the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.840
 next until after
