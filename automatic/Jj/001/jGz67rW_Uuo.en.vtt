10 decibel reduction now you have to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
10 decibel reduction now you have to
keep<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> mind<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.700> cannot<00:01:29.970> really

an XLR plug a 3 prong XLR plug to be

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
an XLR plug a 3 prong XLR plug to be
specific<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.890> now<00:01:43.890> let's<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> sound

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
specific so now let's get to the sound

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.999 
specific so now let's get to the sound
quality<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.299> mic<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:46.320> features<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> gold

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
quality of this mic it features a gold

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
quality of this mic it features a gold
sputtered<00:01:47.460> 6<00:01:48.119> micron<00:01:48.600> low<00:01:49.020> distortion

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
sputtered 6 micron low distortion

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 
sputtered 6 micron low distortion
diaphragm<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:50.850> has<00:01:51.060> an<00:01:51.180> FEC<00:01:51.450> preamp

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
diaphragm and it also has an FEC preamp

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.069 
diaphragm and it also has an FEC preamp
with<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> balanced<00:01:52.680> output<00:01:53.659> what<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.990> does

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
with a balanced output what what does

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
with a balanced output what what does
this<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.350> mean<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.979> has<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> crisp<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this actually mean it has a crisp and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.620 
this actually mean it has a crisp and
warm<00:01:57.630> sound<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.740> low<00:01:58.950> distortion<00:01:59.630> so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
warm sound with low distortion so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.240 
warm sound with low distortion so
