00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.250 
gun that's ever been built what excites
me<00:02:15.160> most<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.580> Shawshank<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.480> its<00:02:16.840> ability

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
me most about Shawshank is its ability

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.390 
me most about Shawshank is its ability
to<00:02:17.290> perform<00:02:17.970> its<00:02:18.970> accuracy<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:21.010> ability

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
to perform its accuracy and the ability

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.560 
to perform its accuracy and the ability
to<00:02:21.430> seize<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.720> distance<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:24.670> all<00:02:24.940> about<00:02:25.240> how

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
to seize the distance it's all about how

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.540 
to seize the distance it's all about how
slippery<00:02:25.960> we<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.350> be<00:02:26.440> through<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> air<00:02:26.860> after

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
slippery we can be through the air after

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.690 
slippery we can be through the air after

16 years in the firearm industry Robin
Sharples<00:02:31.240> knew<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.050> first<00:02:32.230> thing<00:02:32.440> they

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
Sharples knew that the first thing they

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.570 
Sharples knew that the first thing they
had<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.860> get<00:02:33.010> right<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.820> bullet<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
had to get right was the bullet the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.130 
had to get right was the bullet the
bullet<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.180> thing<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.630> have<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.990> have

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
bullet is the thing that we have to have

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.930 
bullet is the thing that we have to have
get<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> target<00:02:39.070> so<00:02:39.340> really<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
get to the target so really it's the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.390 
get to the target so really it's the

natural place to begin it's designed the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
bullet that can be the best possible we

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.750 
bullet that can be the best possible we

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
existing rounds weren't up to the job we

had a capabilities gap we had a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.050 
had a capabilities gap we had a

a wonderful ramp and the 50 the solution

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.690 
a wonderful ramp and the 50 the solution
was<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.110> create<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.590> completely<00:03:12.070> new<00:03:12.220> round

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
was to create a completely new round

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:23.870 
was to create a completely new round

use<00:05:21.600> it<00:05:21.720> at<00:05:21.810> night<00:05:21.840> because<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:23.010> cuts<00:05:23.250> down

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
use it at night because it cuts down

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.320 
use it at night because it cuts down
tremendously<00:05:24.120> on<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.390> noise<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.200> flash

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
tremendously on the noise and the flash

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.910 
tremendously on the noise and the flash
the<00:05:27.330> night-vision<00:05:27.570> scope<00:05:28.170> allows<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.650> sniper

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
the night-vision scope allows the sniper

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.120

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
to see targets up to 750 yards away it

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.340 
to see targets up to 750 yards away it
doesn't<00:05:32.460> emit<00:05:32.850> an<00:05:33.090> infrared<00:05:33.450> signature<00:05:34.110> so

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
doesn't emit an infrared signature so

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.270 
doesn't emit an infrared signature so
you<00:05:34.440> won't<00:05:34.740> give<00:05:34.950> away<00:05:34.980> your<00:05:35.340> position<00:05:37.280> now
