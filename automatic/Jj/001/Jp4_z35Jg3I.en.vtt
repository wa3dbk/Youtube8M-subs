00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.360
 Good morning, the class, beauty. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.180
 to us through 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:19.029
 attacked you and the hole goes out of my 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.029
 forward since he does not know is the deviation 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.009
 getting here already on the way 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 One thing I'll tell you. 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.080
 a not so good thing that happens 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.920
 we can even get a good 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.920
 benefit from it 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.890
 in my case in my accident in morocco 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.780
 asked beast right? 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.350
 I'll tell you, it's very good. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.350
 did you see 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.950
 much smarter to pay too much 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.950
 more attention 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.740
 these guys there have no idea what 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.740
 Play the car once, right? 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.920
 and I had a not horny mania 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.310
 so now i'm sorry ocean that the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.540
 it disturbs people in traffic 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.240
 It messes up a little that bothers not 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 It messes but promised tommy and 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.560
 Preventing major problems 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.200
 I'm getting rid of bigger problems. 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.840
 to take the person is also not warning 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.530
 What are you going through and not always? 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.530
 the person who saw 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.010
 you're alerting year you is precavendo 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.010
 she is also right 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.980
 in this 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.440
 So you end up taking advantage of it is not 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.440
 Something bad happened. 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.430
 we have to do this is that who 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.430
 take advantage of everything will sail 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.219
 we are born without knowing anything 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:49.329
 if you think a lot of attention around you 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:51.810
 You end up knowing a little more about the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.810
 your future 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.760
 your 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.319
 the most beautiful 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.700
 well here I had fell truck 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.700
 that had not fallen 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:37.200
 You already started going out for me. 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.020
 packed in the car 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.480
 so this is it people have to take 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.370
 benefit of all that is that you 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.810
 can absorb larger to larger 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.290
 amount of information and 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.290
 knowledge 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.489
 this is a matter of survival 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.890
 however it is not because in the 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.930
 if the accident Document 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.570
 if you take advantage of the and taking 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.950
 a different attitude when piloting a 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.670
 for example cited is a matter of 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.230
 your survival then we have to 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.230
 have this discernment 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.449
 So we have to have this notion. 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.880
 the goias 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.740
 the population coming 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.020
 in many homes the work will not be the 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.530
 last of the time is who better if he 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.530
 spend there 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.830
 hilton 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.379

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.770
 arriving here already in stride 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.450
 the up arrow is fucking state 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.020
 They go right on leaving and quiet 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.010
 thousand 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.010
 Roman

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.669
