00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello and welcome to the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.029
 yo-yo channel of x-games reloaded my 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.259
 name is andy lea in the last video 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.490
 we have the service so far 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.320
 prepared a bit of software 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 downloaded and something in the direction 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.719
 in this part we will deal with it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 deal with how we do what marcel 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.670
 I will install myself 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 already on it therefore has the last video 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 seen 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.570
 the fdp I have recharged me for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.949
 but of course the internet address 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 I'll show you my private one here 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 browser once that is so much like mysql 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.669
 community server the address so I give 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.649
 he'll be here soon 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.690
 then click here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.420
 still going on my sql server mysql 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 community server click on that gold 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 always a bit down and off the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.850
 red heart versions only considered 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 not long 64 bit download it is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.530
 total nonsense is the go on 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.020
 then good on windows xp windows x86 64 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.680
 Once back there is indeed also quite 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.230
 below us there is a 32 bit version 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.739
 as stable so to speak, there are also 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.460
 I would like to read upwards 64 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.990
 But I do not want bit binaries because 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.430
 run stable because of that I stay 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.640
 at the 32 bit version 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.799
 then just click on download and im 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.380
 next window here at the bottom not necessary 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 just start download you click there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.430
 also up and down there 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.500
 loaded 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.090
 I had that on my computer now 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 down and not on the server right now 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.420
 You should also do it directly 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 is not much better not everything directly 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 to load from the net on your server 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 but rather first on the computer and 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.820
 then upload to the computer 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.119
 windows server so if you did this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.710
 did you have the installation that is 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.979
 then so michael install a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.619
 community 5.6 point 2.2 with point zero 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.939
 looking for the capable as wanted I wanted 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.450
 just say or is not good 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.560
 let's go install it 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 This can be done in the background 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.320
 so in the festival product I accept 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.180
 the license click on next computer 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.430
 that's just contact contact crack 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.149
 internet and update moderately makes a few 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.700
 stories 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.410
 this is so that I have the from 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.069
 choose installation then throw it wants 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.620
 I also do everything on the workbench 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.150
 All I can do is just do it 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.709
 recommend because I have another 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.920
 installation already noticed that if you 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 only the server files are missing 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.950
 some data in it later 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.749
 That's why I have good use 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.969
 a lot of fourth place does that where i am 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.010
 ride could adapt if you want me 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.569
 let that always how it is then 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.400
 Next time he will come back after 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.239
 microsoft net framework on the visual 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.609
 c and microsoft stop again the client 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.349
 for net framework then on next the 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.469
 whole now all the cars have 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.000
 i want to say execute the readers now 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.379
 it will go a thing as will 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.829
 he can not download that is the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.900
 thing connector odww 5.3 point 4 da 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.909
 gets problems with that will be the same 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.650
 we've already wondered 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.349
 Please do not when it have that the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.010
 looks so blurry that's normal 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.349
 not himself to milan installer 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.139
 in this question, continuo on the 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.629
 download out her makes it easy to yes 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.949
 that means then simply lwl jumps there 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.750
 not that connector anyway 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.530
 has worked so now you get the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.359
 installation 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.560
 I'll do that for a while then pause 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.329
 we will not go into the video length and 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.759
 I would like as each once the thing 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.229
 is ready to download the same 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:26.680
 installation is finished we click here 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:30.790
 on the net then asks how would like 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.370
 currently click start initiatives 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.930
 we on next at confectionery server 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.239
 confrontation part can now select 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.250
 new servers should run again 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.109
 means at devil whether machines takes 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.229
 Most servers have limited resources 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.870
 chained by your de or by yours 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.639
 Lucerne if we have a lot of power and several 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.919
 like to heap heap memory there 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.689
 Can you visit so delicate machines 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.759
 go and then he takes i almost believe 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.079
 everything even if he needs it because of me 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.329
 personally a server machines that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.290
 is enough for my circumstances 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.269
 I have the experience with it 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.340
 made what you do not need 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.019
 completely go and give everything 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.900
 I 'm still doing show advanced minutes 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.269
 options then hold the good password 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.639
 would like to have here because if he is up here 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.129
 then there is a third over it 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:19.180
 I have that now as well recognizes that 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:22.970
 automatically it you have to register 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.430
 the password of eur 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.690
 connection to the server itself so from 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.130
 your administrator account 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.240
 most likely that is then 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.470
 now do not see me 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.060
 that's why I have not quite had 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.100
 so it should be there 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.330
 Just take a breath if you like 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.290
 you have a blog password and that 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.270
 That should work 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.300
 mysql and password now enter 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:47.630
 password to connect the server 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.980
 after php html so because user could you 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.900
 but I would like to add right now 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.940
 not what am I doing later with the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.500
 separate programs then on next the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.610
 whole here is the service name 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.190
 can you change if you want me 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.130
 leave it as it is and start mysql 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.650
 server from system state then how 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.160
 should be executed as a system 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.690
 account then on next these are the loks 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.950
 and hate if you wish could could 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.330
 the general is relaxed and well and am 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.760
 lures everything activate I leave it 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.260
 Always out because I needed it so far 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.240
 actually never to the emergency can then later 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.620
 again after then activate the whole 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.710
 confirm with next now makes the 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.419
 configures product and next 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.270
 number initial configuration you click 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.810
 on next you already see service 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.020
 lets change that means that works 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.780
 so far everything is fine again on next 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.300
 and then heavily need mysql workbench 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.500
 we are not just cynical 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.610
 so if now openly look up 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.830
 your little arrow you have now 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.250
 currently the server should also 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.070
 This icon has this white icon 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.060
 means he is running it works and that 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.770
 it was actually already with the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.430
 a game server now installed 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.870
 in the next part we will then php 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.690
 I think install and after 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.919
 then php breathe until then a lot 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.919
 fun and see you next time
