think the next battle is going to be no
all<00:02:58.670> right<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> was<00:02:59.390> thinking<00:02:59.510> a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
all right so I was thinking a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.240 
all right so I was thinking a
three-element<00:03:00.140> dragon<00:03:00.650> but<00:03:00.800> this<00:03:00.950> one<00:03:01.130> is

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
three-element dragon but this one is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.520 
three-element dragon but this one is
weak<00:03:01.460> against<00:03:01.730> fire<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.660> we're<00:03:02.840> weak<00:03:03.080> against

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
weak against fire and we're weak against

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.710 
weak against fire and we're weak against
pot<00:03:04.130> metal<00:03:08.620> we're<00:03:09.620> probably<00:03:09.800> dead<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.540> let's

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
pot metal we're probably dead so let's

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
bottle two more battles and then we

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.320 
bottle two more battles and then we
should<00:03:53.739> be<00:03:53.769> able<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.280> clear<00:03:54.550> that<00:03:54.760> blocking

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.420 

alright<00:05:04.360> luckily<00:05:04.720> we<00:05:04.870> went<00:05:05.110> first<00:05:05.440> we're<00:05:06.250> just

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
alright luckily we went first we're just

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.250 
alright luckily we went first we're just
picking<00:05:06.580> things<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.210> we're<00:05:07.450> weak<00:05:07.930> against

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
picking things that we're weak against

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.700 
picking things that we're weak against
as<00:05:08.530> well<00:05:09.930> maybe<00:05:10.930> because<00:05:11.170> he<00:05:11.290> has<00:05:11.410> three

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
as well maybe because he has three

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.800 
as well maybe because he has three
element<00:05:12.130> dry<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.670> mean<00:05:12.880> three<00:05:13.120> elements<00:05:13.600> so<00:05:13.690> it

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
element dry I mean three elements so it

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.390 
element dry I mean three elements so it
makes<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.110> much<00:05:14.260> stronger<00:05:14.740> alright<00:05:14.980> so<00:05:15.370> that

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
makes it much stronger alright so that

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.220 
makes it much stronger alright so that
is<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.850> second<00:05:16.300> block<00:05:16.540> we<00:05:16.780> just<00:05:16.990> broke<00:05:17.170> the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
is the second block we just broke the

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.170 
is the second block we just broke the
