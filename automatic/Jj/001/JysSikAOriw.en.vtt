00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.360
 Conditions the team looks like 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.770
 a taxi 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.180

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 conditions knows what the occupancy 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.360
 Looks like a taxi 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.710

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.440
 probably make the color is 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.680
 nice but it is not taxi comfort and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.479
 davina tuning company are necessarily too 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.960
 a bit of fields exhausts intake 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.250
 and interior does not sound that way 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 bad that's curious what's there 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.080
 I also come out choose chemical 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.789

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.610
 want to get in touch is cool 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.970
 june and first of all the color that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.410
 The thing is that green is cool though 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:43.570
 not taxi compliant theme wheels red-red 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.570
 Rims on the taxi could turn black 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.920
 the suction through to the air filter 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.320
 system where are we because here has a lot 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.660
 become more sporty 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 The charge pressure long matures this line 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.830
 the pulpit is in here 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.780
 with the glass here makes the whole 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.580
 you have to break times 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.820
 have eye for detail 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.520
 that means we lose like this down here 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.520
 the line with the taxi yellow
