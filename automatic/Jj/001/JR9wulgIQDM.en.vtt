then just add it to my flower and it

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.550 
then just add it to my flower and it
gives<00:04:00.489> kind<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.909> variegated<00:04:01.239> look<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.139> it<00:04:02.379> I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
gives kind of a variegated look and it I

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.409 
gives kind of a variegated look and it I

just really really like it I do like it
better<00:04:04.560> than<00:04:05.560> some<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:05.919> other<00:04:06.599> like<00:04:07.599> the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
better than some of the other like the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.809 
better than some of the other like the
mists<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:08.169> stuff<00:04:08.439> which<00:04:09.220> will<00:04:09.370> probably<00:04:09.730> be

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
mists and stuff which will probably be

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:10.199 
mists and stuff which will probably be
okay

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
okay

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.839 
okay
if<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.919> really<00:04:11.919> water<00:04:12.099> them<00:04:12.280> down<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
if you really water them down but the

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.000 
if you really water them down but the
colors<00:04:13.150> are<00:04:13.269> kind<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.810> intense<00:04:14.169> on<00:04:14.349> those<00:04:14.530> and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
colors are kind of intense on those and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.060 
colors are kind of intense on those and
they<00:04:15.700> um<00:04:15.909> I<00:04:16.269> don't<00:04:17.199> know<00:04:17.320> I'm<00:04:17.470> not<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.650> big<00:04:17.829> fan

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
they um I don't know I'm not a big fan

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.339 
they um I don't know I'm not a big fan
of<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:19.810> them<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.079> look<00:04:20.199> softer<00:04:22.349> pour

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
of the I like them to look softer pour

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.279 
of the I like them to look softer pour
my<00:04:23.500> water<00:04:23.680> out<00:04:24.039> let's<00:04:24.520> do<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.510> don't<00:04:26.020> think<00:04:26.080> I

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
my water out let's do I don't think I

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.080 
my water out let's do I don't think I
have<00:04:26.440> any<00:04:26.590> blue<00:04:26.889> ones<00:04:29.520> get<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:30.849> here<00:04:31.060> and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
have any blue ones get this in here and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.460 
have any blue ones get this in here and

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.589 
pick up a bunch of color and I'm
thinking<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.130> probably<00:04:39.400> if<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.120> really

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
thinking you probably if you really

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.450 
thinking you probably if you really
really<00:04:40.810> watered-down<00:04:41.260> acrylic<00:04:41.889> paints

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
really watered-down acrylic paints

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.800 
really watered-down acrylic paints
you<00:04:42.880> could<00:04:43.060> probably<00:04:43.150> kind<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.570> do<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.780> same

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
you could probably kind of do the same

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.730 
you could probably kind of do the same
thing<00:04:44.159> but<00:04:45.159> I<00:04:45.430> really<00:04:45.699> like<00:04:45.849> this<00:04:46.060> cuz<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.389> can

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
thing but I really like this cuz you can

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.860 
thing but I really like this cuz you can
really<00:04:47.740> customize<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.370> color<00:04:48.690> fairly<00:04:49.690> easily

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
really customize the color fairly easily

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.450 
really customize the color fairly easily
I'm<00:04:50.380> gonna<00:04:50.530> pick<00:04:50.770> up<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:50.979> little<00:04:51.070> bit<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.490> navy

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
I'm gonna pick up a little bit of a navy

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.460 
I'm gonna pick up a little bit of a navy
you<00:04:54.460> couldn't<00:04:54.820> get<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> shabby<00:04:55.570> aqua<00:04:56.050> color<00:04:56.260> in

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
you couldn't get a shabby aqua color in

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.060 
you couldn't get a shabby aqua color in
there<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.229> like<00:04:59.409> them<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.770> cream

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
there and I like them on the cream

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.879 
there and I like them on the cream
because<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.780> kind<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.050> softens<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.650> color

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
because the it kind of softens the color

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.920 
because the it kind of softens the color
and<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.400> would<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:03.820> more<00:05:04.060> than<00:05:04.240> muted<00:05:04.570> colors

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
and I would like more than muted colors

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:18.320 
and I would like more than muted colors
oh<00:05:06.030> this<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.180> pretty

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.740 

okay<00:05:19.110> those<00:05:19.530> are<00:05:19.949> getting<00:05:20.069> dry<00:05:20.340> really<00:05:20.789> really

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
okay those are getting dry really really
