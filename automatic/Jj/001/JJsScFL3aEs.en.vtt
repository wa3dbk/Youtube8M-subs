00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.179
 the gal that the falcon is only for 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.130
 show you some tricks and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.260
 secrets of futsal and skill 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.880
 show you some fights that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.880
 there are game situations 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.670
 first a situation that we use 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.689
 much in the position where I pass the ball 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 from behind 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.290
 I'll give the pass to the companion. 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:43.489
 what is going on behind me I use 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.930
 this book or something else 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.670
 evolved that is more to a move 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 where it is more or less the same 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.559
 movement but it's an elastic behind it, right? 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.270
 I'm training a lot yet 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 ends up using a lot in the games I 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:07.770
 I get the ball here and the other two 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.990
 It's my book is known in Brazil. 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.140
 whole by rodrigo hawk that is in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.909
 running more or less the ones you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.580
 passes the same foot over the ball and with 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 the same foot you seek the ball has a 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 glance it seems that it is easy but 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.030
 execution is difficult but it is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030
 quiet 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.840
 and any other place in Brazil 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.310
 world I go today the staff asks for 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 make the scooter in which the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.150
 differential that makes the ball roll 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.740
 It's different from stopping to run the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.940
 marker usually knows that you are going 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.369
 do when you come with the ball rolling 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.300
 the player does not know what you 're going to do 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.300
 the difficulty is greater 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.040
 I have a new group that I'm training. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.740
 first take off by means of late hurricane 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.570
 future lyrics is also another dance in 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.929
 What if you throw the ball away from me or samba? 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.480
 dance you do the same calls to dance 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.760
 I do not know that will lead me the ball 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.820
 I think this is natural so it's joy 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.560
 on the feet and the joy of doing and 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.640
 to bring the professional side I think 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 are a secret
