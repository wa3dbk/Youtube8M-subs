00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
for example it's moving can look it and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:51.290 
for example it's moving can look it and
it<00:00:41.250> doesn't<00:00:41.640> move<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.980> can<00:00:48.289> fistic<00:00:49.940> it's<00:00:50.940> moving

it doesn't move I can fistic it's moving
too<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> bass<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.399> perfectly<00:00:54.059> stable

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
too but the bass it's perfectly stable

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:11.740 
too but the bass it's perfectly stable
as<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:01:07.400> just<00:01:08.400> lying<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:10.549> and

as you can see just lying there and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
as you can see just lying there and
behind<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.939> my<00:01:15.210> hand<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.810> also<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
also behind this this and in back this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.060 
also behind this this and in back this
is<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> second<00:01:29.340> version<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.900> my<00:01:30.900> cockpit<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
is the second version of my cockpit and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.899 
is the second version of my cockpit and
there<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.090> already<00:01:33.380> prepared<00:01:34.610> third<00:01:35.610> version

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there is already prepared third version

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.200 
there is already prepared third version
after<00:01:36.350> Kickstarter<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.729> there<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.850> flops

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
after Kickstarter and there are flops

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.370 
after Kickstarter and there are flops
everywhere<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:42.030> bent<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> put

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
everywhere like this you bent it and put

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.270 
everywhere like this you bent it and put
inside<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.990> also<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.380> texture<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
inside here also with texture so you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
inside here also with texture so you
hide<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.270> these<00:01:48.890> ugly<00:01:49.890> edges<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
hide all these ugly edges and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.980 
hide all these ugly edges and
also<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.650> everywhere<00:01:56.240> flops<00:01:57.240> flops<00:01:58.250> here

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
also here everywhere flops flops here

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.950 
also here everywhere flops flops here
you<00:02:00.990> close<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:03.330> will<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.660> even<00:02:03.930> more

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you close it and it will be even more

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.400 
you close it and it will be even more
stable<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.770> already<00:02:05.550> tested<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
stable I already tested this is the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
stable I already tested this is the
first<00:02:07.680> flop<00:02:08.539> but<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.600> have<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.300> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
first flop but I have and you can see it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.290 
first flop but I have and you can see it
looks<00:02:12.890> okay<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.130> think<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.780> looks<00:02:15.959> alright

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
looks okay I think it looks alright

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.870 
looks okay I think it looks alright
also<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.570> will<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.980> flops<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.850> I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
also here will be flops here and here I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.090 
also here will be flops here and here I
have<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.570> monitor<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:31.170> gauges

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
have a monitor and on this have gauges

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.679 

here<00:02:51.340> will<00:02:51.519> be<00:02:51.670> flaps<00:02:52.890> drop<00:02:54.750> bend<00:02:55.750> close<00:02:57.689> this

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
here will be flaps drop bend close this

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:08.339 

just<00:03:03.180> texture<00:03:04.439> as<00:03:05.439> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.829> see<00:03:06.129> here<00:03:07.349> and

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
just texture as you can see here and

just texture as you can see here and
open<00:03:08.769> make<00:03:09.430> very<00:03:09.790> bad<00:03:10.030> noise<00:03:17.159> also<00:03:18.159> here<00:03:18.519> I

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
open make very bad noise also here I

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.229 
open make very bad noise also here I
have<00:03:18.849> small<00:03:19.389> action<00:03:20.790> open<00:03:21.790> it

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
I have story poles attract era ir and is

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.589 
I have story poles attract era ir and is
a<00:03:36.099> big<00:03:36.430> display<00:03:37.359> all<00:03:37.689> those<00:03:37.989> wires<00:03:38.290> going<00:03:39.599> back

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
a big display all those wires going back

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.909 
a big display all those wires going back
and<00:03:42.389> connected<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.569> computer<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:45.419> will<00:03:46.419> go<00:03:46.919> with

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
and connected to computer I will go with

00:03:47.919 --> 00:04:22.300 
and connected to computer I will go with
the<00:03:48.159> chair<00:03:50.129> inside<00:03:55.709> okay<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:57.209> know<00:03:59.190> then<00:04:00.190> fly

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.750 

also<00:04:23.310> someone<00:04:23.699> says<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.150> if<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.199> take<00:04:25.760> the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
also someone says that if you take the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.370 
also someone says that if you take the
plant<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.389> cut<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.560> from<00:04:29.090> wood<00:04:30.229> will<00:04:31.229> be

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
plant and cut it from wood will be

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.439 
plant and cut it from wood will be
better<00:04:32.210> but<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:33.900> not<00:04:33.990> possible<00:04:34.620> because

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
better but it's not possible because

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.939 
better but it's not possible because
it's<00:04:36.449> four<00:04:36.780> millimeters<00:04:38.240> cardboard<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.949> many

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
it's four millimeters cardboard and many

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.750 
it's four millimeters cardboard and many
ribs<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.789> lot<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.990> lot<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.740> parts<00:04:44.490> are

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
ribs and a lot of a lot of parts are

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.260 
ribs and a lot of a lot of parts are
bent<00:04:46.010> as<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.520> cannot<00:04:50.880> do<00:04:51.090> this

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
bent as you see and you cannot do this

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.330 
bent as you see and you cannot do this
and<00:04:52.340> also<00:04:53.340> it's<00:04:53.669> more<00:04:54.180> expensive<00:04:55.100> it's<00:04:56.100> much

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
and also it's more expensive it's much

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.100 
and also it's more expensive it's much
cheaper<00:04:57.289> you<00:04:58.289> can't<00:04:58.669> print<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.150> textures<00:05:00.870> on

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
cheaper you can't print the textures on

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.770 
cheaper you can't print the textures on
it<00:05:03.110> all<00:05:04.110> right<00:05:04.169> so<00:05:04.889> this<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.250> first<00:05:05.880> update<00:05:06.419> and

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
it all right so this is first update and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.310 
it all right so this is first update and
let's<00:05:07.400> meet<00:05:08.599> next<00:05:09.599> video<00:05:10.310> ciao
