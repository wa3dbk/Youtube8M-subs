00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
like to use the Magnum a lot and go for
these<00:02:39.270> crazy<00:02:39.660> game<00:02:39.959> plays<00:02:40.230> which<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.500> don't

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
these crazy game plays which I don't

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.350 
these crazy game plays which I don't
even<00:02:40.800> understand<00:02:41.340> how<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:41.970> get<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.330> when

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
even understand how they get them when

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.180 
even understand how they get them when
just<00:02:42.720> using<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.050> pistol<00:02:43.230> because<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.739> pistol

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
just using a pistol because this pistol

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.699 
just using a pistol because this pistol
the<00:02:44.580> Magnum<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.209> shoot<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.900> freaking<00:02:46.470> slow

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
the Magnum you shoot so freaking slow

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.729 
the Magnum you shoot so freaking slow
with<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.040> honestly<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.060> shoot<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.630> slow<00:02:49.050> it's

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
with it honestly you shoot so slow it's

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.740 
with it honestly you shoot so slow it's
really<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.519> not<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> good<00:02:51.030> gun<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
really just it's not a good gun but I

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.449 
really just it's not a good gun but I
mean<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.019> hardcore<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.739> decent<00:02:53.069> gun<00:02:53.220> but

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
mean in hardcore it's a decent gun but

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.039 
mean in hardcore it's a decent gun but
still<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.000> lot<00:02:54.330> harder<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.810> use<00:02:55.019> than

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
still it's a lot harder to use than

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.199 
still it's a lot harder to use than
using<00:02:55.739> like<00:02:55.980> an<00:02:56.100> AK<00:02:56.400> 12<00:02:56.670> are<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> honey

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
using like an AK 12 are like a honey

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.729 
using like an AK 12 are like a honey
badger<00:02:57.420> or<00:02:57.780> something<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.560> still

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739
