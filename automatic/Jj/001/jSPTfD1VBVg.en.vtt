00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 life 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.660
 about 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.759
 Hello dear friends with you, Sergei 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.369
 and i keep going game gta wai 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.079
 city and so these are 4 missions on the rose and and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.119
 here we need to intimidate 2 jurors 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.520
 who can push cousin trout 5 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.140
 years for fraud 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.579
 Well yourself trout are those on which we 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 Now we are working on this in any way 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.209
 allow that to be the coolest on 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.259
 planted because as you know we 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:34.439
 looking for money dope for sony trout 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.990
 the task for today is just to fall asleep 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.770
 them so they changed their mind 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.359
 you can never kill them 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 because it will look so 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:45.320
 the trout family just removed them and every 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.350
 he is accused of a cousin therefore 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.850
 it is necessary and how do you know Rosie himself nothing 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.510
 can not do it because he just 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.120
 afraid and therefore sends us to anyone 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.070
 forget you really and can not it 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.840
 some idiot at the beginning of the mission shot down 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.180
 in the course of the builder well, so be it 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 call and respect but I don't blame him 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.050
 because this organizer was a hammer 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.830
 who in this mission is very us 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.229
 will come in handy 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.170
 fall into gold and we are now 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.790
 already arrived to bully 1 juror he 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.740
 put my cars right here the most and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.410
 turned into a pile of trash just that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.209
 then later I came tweak 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.630
 when will be such a white smoke 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:30.530
 small then it will come out so bash 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.570
 the car does not know what well here and 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.420
 all the first to scare you every now 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.290
 won't think that cousin trout is guilty 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.120
 and we go in the meantime to intimidate 2 all 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.069
 these cars are really some kind of car 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.069
 does not look like 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.469
 this is for us plus the second jury 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.609
 now itâ€™s worth talking to 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:55.069
 area somewhere near ocean beach 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.630
 okay we go there I don't remember you like 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.940
 ocean without good 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.770
 or washington beach but I do not remember exactly 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.410
 what is the area okay okay 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.750
 2 jurors are much easier to scare than 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.750
 1 see for yourself 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.940
 so go now, just go there 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.940
 then you start harder a little and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.100
 By the way here, too, there are phones mission 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.990
 so here's the first jury beat him but not 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.370
 kill him as told he will sit down 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.470
 car and you will see something 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.630
 interesting 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.480
 perfectly well and by the way if you picked up 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.340
 hammer then you can take it here with us 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.130
 now we need to paint the door 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.830
 juror machine more precisely and get it 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:50.160
 from there personally the mission was completed he accomplished 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.830
 too already scared and now he too 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.560
 changed my mind yes here we are 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.360
 Well done today 400 dollars to everyone 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.780
 thanks for watching good luck everyone 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.440

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.440
