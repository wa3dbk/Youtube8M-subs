the same mud and I'm just going to

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.930 
the same mud and I'm just going to
stipple<00:00:53.379> it<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.739> little<00:00:53.949> bit<00:00:54.129> here<00:00:54.370> once<00:00:54.609> I<00:00:54.760> get

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
stipple it a little bit here once I get

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.579 
stipple it a little bit here once I get
the<00:00:55.030> last<00:00:55.210> of<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.570> Sun<00:00:55.809> that'll<00:00:56.140> just<00:00:56.289> make<00:00:56.350> it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
the last of the Sun that'll just make it

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.220 
the last of the Sun that'll just make it
easier<00:00:56.890> for<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.629> bricks<00:00:58.839> to<00:00:58.989> stick

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
easier for the for the bricks to stick

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.000 
easier for the for the bricks to stick
now<00:00:59.829> what<00:01:00.730> we're<00:01:01.030> going<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.300> do<00:01:01.480> is<00:01:02.010> we're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
now what we're going to do is we're

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.890 
now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.160> push<00:01:03.339> these<00:01:03.519> bricks<00:01:03.789> in<00:01:03.999> and<00:01:04.239> why<00:01:04.870> I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
going to push these bricks in and why I

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.780 
going to push these bricks in and why I
wanted<00:01:05.260> more<00:01:05.410> material<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.370> that<00:01:06.550> when<00:01:06.760> I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
wanted more material is so that when I

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.990 
wanted more material is so that when I
push<00:01:07.000> them<00:01:07.150> on<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:08.170> material<00:01:08.800> will<00:01:09.190> squeeze

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
push them on the material will squeeze

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.810 
push them on the material will squeeze
or<00:01:10.270> ooze<00:01:10.450> in<00:01:10.810> between<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.350> bricks<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.830> of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
or ooze in between the bricks and of

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.400 
or ooze in between the bricks and of
course<00:01:13.060> then<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.270> looks<00:01:13.420> like<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.660> natural<00:01:13.930> kind

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
course then it looks like a natural kind

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.910 
course then it looks like a natural kind
of<00:01:14.560> mortar<00:01:15.360> these<00:01:16.360> bricks<00:01:17.110> are<00:01:17.380> white

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920

portions<00:01:57.590> there<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:58.970> have<00:01:59.180> sort<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.540> like<00:01:59.720> a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
portions there so we have sort of like a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.870 
portions there so we have sort of like a
continuous<00:02:00.410> line<00:02:00.710> almost<00:02:01.040> like<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:01.430> do<00:02:01.670> this

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
continuous line almost like we do this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
continuous line almost like we do this
shape<00:02:02.150> on<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.450> wall

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.520 

you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.789> how<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> mud<00:02:09.269> is<00:02:09.410> oozing<00:02:10.410> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you can see how the mud is oozing in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.750 
you can see how the mud is oozing in
between<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> bricks<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.370> looks<00:02:11.550> like

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
between the bricks and looks like

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.140 
between the bricks and looks like
someone's<00:02:12.180> snorted<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.220> now<00:02:14.220> this

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
someone's snorted it right in now this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.670 
someone's snorted it right in now this
is<00:02:15.209> very<00:02:15.480> important<00:02:15.870> step<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.260> careful<00:02:16.560> with

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
is very important step be careful with

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.820 
is very important step be careful with
this<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.640> foam<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> wet<00:02:19.260> background

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
this one the foam is on a wet background

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.040 
this one the foam is on a wet background
so<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.730> only<00:02:20.879> thing<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:21.300> burn<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
so the only thing that will burn is the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.470 
so the only thing that will burn is the
foam<00:02:22.349> itself<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:24.000> give<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.269> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
foam itself it this will give you the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.710 
foam itself it this will give you the
gradiate<00:02:25.440> radiated<00:02:26.099> edge<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:27.569> not

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
gradiate radiated edge so we're not

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.479 
gradiate radiated edge so we're not
bringing<00:02:28.080> our<00:02:28.470> next<00:02:28.739> step<00:02:28.890> which<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.220> mud

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
bringing our next step which is the mud

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.460 
bringing our next step which is the mud
the<00:02:29.670> charging<00:02:30.060> mud<00:02:30.239> it's<00:02:30.810> not<00:02:30.989> coming<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the charging mud it's not coming up to a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.869 
the charging mud it's not coming up to a
full<00:02:31.680> quarter<00:02:31.980> inch<00:02:32.129> that's<00:02:32.519> what<00:02:32.760> is

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
full quarter inch that's what is

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.630 
full quarter inch that's what is
transitions<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.870> foam<00:02:34.080> down<00:02:34.410> also<00:02:35.220> pass<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
transitions the foam down also pass the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.119 
transitions the foam down also pass the
torch<00:02:36.239> along<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.750> face<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.620> foam<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
torch along the face of the foam and

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.930 
torch along the face of the foam and
that<00:02:38.879> will<00:02:39.030> give<00:02:39.180> us<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.510> sort<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> look<00:02:40.170> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
that will give us that sort of look of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.910 
that will give us that sort of look of
bricks<00:02:41.940> from<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.630> hundred<00:02:43.019> years<00:02:43.260> ago<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.829> know

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
bricks from a hundred years ago you know

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460 
bricks from a hundred years ago you know
that<00:02:44.099> had<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.549> sort<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.540> nice<00:02:46.110> shape<00:02:46.440> to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
that had all that sort of nice shape to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.360 
that had all that sort of nice shape to
them<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:47.670> also<00:02:47.959> has<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.260> styrofoam<00:02:49.950> drinks

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
them it also has the styrofoam drinks

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.750 
them it also has the styrofoam drinks
it'll<00:02:50.549> give<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.819> little<00:02:50.849> more<00:02:51.150> strength

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
it'll give it a little more strength

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
it'll give it a little more strength
it's<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.849> nice<00:02:54.030> side<00:02:54.269> effect<00:02:54.299> all<00:02:55.200> right<00:02:55.349> now

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
it's a nice side effect all right now

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.410 
it's a nice side effect all right now
we're<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.829> take<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> hot<00:02:56.280> control<00:02:56.640> same

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
we're going to take a hot control same

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900 
we're going to take a hot control same
mud<00:02:57.629> again<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.370> we're<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.579> put<00:02:59.760> this

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
mud again and we're going to put this

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.180 
mud again and we're going to put this
mud<00:03:00.180> around<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.590> brick<00:03:01.799> shake<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.069> can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
mud around the brick shake and you can

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.039 
mud around the brick shake and you can
see<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.670> we're<00:03:05.819> starting<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.299> get<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.569> ID<00:03:06.720> or

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
see that we're starting to get the ID or

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.110 
see that we're starting to get the ID or
starting<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.440> get<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> look<00:03:07.890> as<00:03:08.099> though<00:03:08.310> once

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
starting to get the look as though once

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.170 
starting to get the look as though once
upon<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.420> time<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.989> brick<00:03:10.680> wall<00:03:10.709> was<00:03:11.190> purged

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
upon a time this brick wall was purged

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.770 
upon a time this brick wall was purged
over<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.950> portions<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.480> plaster<00:03:15.480> have

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
over and portions of the plaster have

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140 
over and portions of the plaster have
fallen<00:03:16.739> away<00:03:16.950> exposing<00:03:17.670> some<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.000> old

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
fallen away exposing some of the old

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.349 
fallen away exposing some of the old
brick<00:03:18.450> underneath<00:03:19.850> always<00:03:20.850> nice<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.209> have<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
brick underneath always nice to have a

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.500 
brick underneath always nice to have a
little<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:22.380> chunk<00:03:22.620> inside<00:03:23.010> there<00:03:23.510> helps

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
little little chunk inside there helps

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.449 
little little chunk inside there helps
it<00:03:24.599> look<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.810> little<00:03:24.900> more<00:03:25.049> real<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:26.099> right<00:03:26.280> now

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
it look a little more real all right now

it look a little more real all right now
we're<00:03:26.639> just<00:03:26.819> flashing<00:03:27.209> some<00:03:27.329> water<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:27.780> there

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
we're just flashing some water on there

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.129 
we're just flashing some water on there
just<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.340> regular<00:03:29.700> brush<00:03:30.269> any<00:03:30.630> brush<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:30.959> have

we're<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:35.069> going<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.280> soften<00:03:35.580> those<00:03:35.819> edges

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.300 

softening<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.409> makes<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.709> look<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.250> a

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
softening it makes it look like it's a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.009 
softening it makes it look like it's a
little<00:03:41.459> bit<00:03:41.549> older<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.390> bit<00:03:42.510> more<00:03:42.690> warm

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
little bit older a little bit more warm

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.800 
little bit older a little bit more warm
and<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.519> hasn't<00:03:44.700> been<00:03:44.879> done

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and just like it hasn't been done

yesterday<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:47.340> we'll<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.580> keep<00:03:47.730> going

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
yesterday so we'll just keep going

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.539 
yesterday so we'll just keep going
around<00:03:48.120> working<00:03:48.450> those<00:03:48.720> edges<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:50.220> things<00:03:50.430> we

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
around working those edges the things we

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.080 
around working those edges the things we
don't<00:03:50.670> like

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
don't like

notice that there's little pits that

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.820 
notice that there's little pits that
form<00:04:20.490> as<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.090> water<00:04:21.300> impacts<00:04:21.930> on<00:04:22.170> the<00:04:22.260> mud<00:04:22.470> and

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
form as the water impacts on the mud and
