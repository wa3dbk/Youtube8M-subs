into two parts that's the setup and the
actual<00:00:45.120> execution<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> first<00:00:46.860> half

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
actual execution so for the first half

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.229 
actual execution so for the first half
of<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.280> video<00:00:47.580> we're<00:00:47.699> going<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:47.850> talk<00:00:48.000> mainly

weight off the floor for now I'm gonna

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
weight off the floor for now I'm gonna
make<00:00:56.909> a<00:00:56.970> really<00:00:57.269> big<00:00:57.449> focus<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.199> set<00:00:58.440> up

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.310 
make a really big focus on these set up
and<00:00:58.850> less<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> focus<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.720> actual<00:01:01.019> lifts

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and less of a focus on the actual lifts

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.079 
and less of a focus on the actual lifts
and<00:01:01.500> execution<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.610> later<00:01:02.820> more

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
and execution and in the later more

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.359 
and execution and in the later more
advanced<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.690> intermediate<00:01:03.840> video<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:05.129> gonna

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
advanced or intermediate video I'm gonna

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
advanced or intermediate video I'm gonna
make<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> bigger<00:01:05.940> focus<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.539> the<00:01:06.690> actual<00:01:07.200> lift

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
make a bigger focus on the actual lift

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.380 
make a bigger focus on the actual lift

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the bar where the bar is over the toe

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.240

nor am i standing too close with my

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
nor am i standing too close with my
shins<00:01:29.610> against<00:01:30.179> the<00:01:30.270> bar<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.899> not

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
shins against the bar that's also not

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.529 
shins against the bar that's also not
ideal<00:01:31.080> we<00:01:32.039> want<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.490> balanced<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
ideal we want to be balanced so that the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.960 
ideal we want to be balanced so that the
bars<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.929> of<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.140> middle<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.560> foot<00:01:34.970> now

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bars are of the middle of the foot now

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.100 
bars are of the middle of the foot now
from<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.240> point<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> view<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
from your point of view that's going to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.280 
from your point of view that's going to
look<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.650> bar<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.130> over<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
look like that the bar is over the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.690 
look like that the bar is over the
shoelace<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> there

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
shoelace not so you can see that there

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.800 
shoelace not so you can see that there
you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.820> again<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.299> want<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> stand<00:01:45.630> too

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you know again don't want to stand too

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
you know again don't want to stand too
far<00:01:46.079> away<00:01:46.170> from<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> bar<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> bars

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
far away from the bar so at the bars

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
far away from the bar so at the bars
over<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.490> toes<00:01:48.110> nor<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.229> want<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> send

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
over your toes nor do you want to send

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
over your toes nor do you want to send
the<00:01:49.680> bar<00:01:49.829> against<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.130> shins<00:01:50.399> then

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the bar against your shins then

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.859 
the bar against your shins then
obviously<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:50.970> exaggerating<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.659> both

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
obviously I'm exaggerating this both

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
obviously I'm exaggerating this both
ways<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.790> pretty<00:01:54.060> much

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
ways but we want it to be pretty much

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.319 
ways but we want it to be pretty much
perfect<00:01:54.890> over<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> middle<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.700> foot<00:01:59.329> now

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
perfect over the middle of your foot now

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.090 
perfect over the middle of your foot now
second<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.920> don't

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
second to that as well is that you don't

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.440 
second to that as well is that you don't
either<00:02:02.250> stance<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.030> wide<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.240> too

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
either stance to be too wide not too

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.950 
either stance to be too wide not too
narrow

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
narrow

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.620 
narrow

some blisters will prefer a slightly

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.340 
some blisters will prefer a slightly
wider<00:02:12.000> stance<00:02:12.299> some<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> first<00:02:13.049> lucky

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
narrower stance but a good rule of thumb

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.050 
narrower stance but a good rule of thumb
is<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.290> stand<00:02:16.739> with<00:02:16.890> your<00:02:17.040> feet<00:02:17.640> under<00:02:17.970> your

doing<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:20.660> takes<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.930> little<00:03:21.050> bit

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
doing that and this takes a little bit

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.620 
doing that and this takes a little bit
of<00:03:21.290> motor<00:03:21.590> control<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:22.010> skill<00:03:22.490> but<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.570> an

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
of motor control and skill but it's an

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.240 
of motor control and skill but it's an
important<00:03:24.020> step<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:24.500> here<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:25.040> see<00:03:25.190> me

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
important step so here you can see me

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.690 
important step so here you can see me
doing<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:25.459> well<00:03:27.010> you've<00:03:28.010> kind<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.400> round<00:03:28.610> it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
doing that well you've kind of round it

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.130 
doing that well you've kind of round it
over<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.270> need<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.510> squeeze<00:03:29.840> your

chest up think big chest and that'll put
you<00:03:32.540> into<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.750> good<00:03:32.870> position<00:03:32.990> so<00:03:33.820> now<00:03:34.820> after

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
you into a good position so now after

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.880 
you into a good position so now after
these<00:03:35.750> four<00:03:35.990> steps<00:03:36.200> were<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.560> good<00:03:36.709> position

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
these four steps were in a good position

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.710 
these four steps were in a good position
to<00:03:37.160> pick<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.610> weight<00:03:37.730> up<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.030> that's<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
to pick the weight up and that's the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.510 
to pick the weight up and that's the
position<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.080> can<00:03:39.230> see<00:03:39.350> their<00:03:42.370> position<00:03:43.370> to

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
position you can see their position to

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.410 
position you can see their position to
move<00:03:43.670> slowly<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.360> way

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
move slowly of the way

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.330 
move slowly of the way
so<00:03:47.420> as<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.720> can<00:03:47.810> see<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.380> setup<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.920> quite

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
so as you can see the setup is quite

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.550 
so as you can see the setup is quite
simple<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.060> four<00:03:50.330> step<00:03:50.570> stool<00:03:50.840> if<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.440> can

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
simple of a four step stool if you can

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.870 
simple of a four step stool if you can
set<00:03:51.739> yourself<00:03:52.010> up<00:03:52.160> really<00:03:52.430> well<00:03:52.550> you're<00:03:52.790> gonna

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
set yourself up really well you're gonna

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.430 
set yourself up really well you're gonna
be<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> really<00:03:53.270> good<00:03:53.360> position<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.989> lift<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
be in a really good position to lift the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.080 
be in a really good position to lift the
weight<00:03:54.560> effectively<00:03:54.830> let's<00:03:55.670> get<00:03:55.820> into<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
weight effectively let's get into the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.110 
weight effectively let's get into the
execution<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:58.489> right<00:03:58.640> now<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:58.820> might<00:03:59.060> have

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
execution all right now you might have

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.510 
execution all right now you might have
noticed<00:03:59.480> from<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.840> starting<00:04:00.709> position<00:04:01.070> that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
noticed from the starting position that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.310 
noticed from the starting position that
the<00:04:01.640> knees<00:04:01.790> are<00:04:01.820> over<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.300> bar<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:03.170> order

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
the knees are over the bar and in order

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.750 
the knees are over the bar and in order
for<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.500> bar<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.830> come<00:04:03.950> up<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.340> need<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.520> push

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
for the bar to come up you need to push

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.850 
for the bar to come up you need to push
the<00:04:04.970> knees<00:04:05.150> back<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.870> give<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.260> bar<00:04:06.560> some

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
the knees back to give the bar some

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.070 
the knees back to give the bar some
clutch<00:04:07.130> space<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.790> move<00:04:07.910> up<00:04:08.150> we<00:04:08.780> want<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.959> talk

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
clutch space to move up we want to talk

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.270 
clutch space to move up we want to talk
about<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.380> in<00:04:09.470> more<00:04:09.590> detail<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.130> future

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
about this in more detail in a future

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.640 
about this in more detail in a future
video<00:04:10.430> but<00:04:10.610> for<00:04:10.820> now<00:04:10.880> think<00:04:11.750> about<00:04:11.959> pushing<00:04:12.350> to

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
video but for now think about pushing to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.380 
video but for now think about pushing to
the<00:04:12.680> ground<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:13.040> your<00:04:13.070> heels<00:04:13.400> pushing<00:04:14.239> your

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
the ground of your heels pushing your

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.449 
the ground of your heels pushing your
knees<00:04:14.420> back<00:04:14.840> whatever<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.620> need<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:15.800> do<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
knees back whatever you need to do to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.800 
knees back whatever you need to do to
get<00:04:16.609> in<00:04:16.700> your<00:04:16.820> head<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> need<00:04:17.270> to<00:04:17.330> extend

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
get in your head that you need to extend

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.470 
get in your head that you need to extend
at<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.109> knees<00:04:18.580> early<00:04:19.580> in<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.730> lift

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.670 

all<00:04:25.480> right<00:04:25.630> once<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.870> bar<00:04:26.050> gets<00:04:26.290> about<00:04:26.500> your

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
all right once the bar gets about your

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.110 
all right once the bar gets about your
knee<00:04:26.800> level<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.310> almost<00:04:27.670> becomes<00:04:27.940> like<00:04:28.030> a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
knee level this almost becomes like a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.850 
knee level this almost becomes like a
Romanian<00:04:29.110> deadlift<00:04:29.440> if<00:04:29.590> you've<00:04:29.710> done<00:04:29.830> that

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
Romanian deadlift if you've done that

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.040 
Romanian deadlift if you've done that
variation<00:04:30.370> before<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:31.420> bars<00:04:31.660> going<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.900> be<00:04:31.960> at

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
variation before the bars going to be at

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.350 
variation before the bars going to be at
your<00:04:32.140> knees<00:04:32.320> your<00:04:33.060> hamstrings<00:04:34.060> are<00:04:34.150> going<00:04:34.300> to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
your knees your hamstrings are going to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.670 
your knees your hamstrings are going to
be<00:04:34.420> on<00:04:34.510> relative<00:04:34.870> stretch<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.560> need

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
be on relative stretch and all you need

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.500 
be on relative stretch and all you need
to<00:04:35.740> do<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:35.920> snap<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.280> hips<00:04:36.460> through<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.180> it's

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
to do is snap the hips through and it's

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.970 
to do is snap the hips through and it's
important<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.870> bar<00:04:38.020> stays<00:04:38.260> close<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.860> want

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
important the bar stays close so I want

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.470 
important the bar stays close so I want
you<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.070> think<00:04:39.280> about<00:04:39.370> rubbing<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:40.120> cords

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
you to think about rubbing the cords

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.610 
you to think about rubbing the cords
with<00:04:40.630> your<00:04:40.750> bar<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> bar<00:04:41.200> should<00:04:41.380> rub<00:04:41.500> your

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
with your bar the bar should rub your

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.170 
with your bar the bar should rub your
legs<00:04:41.740> throughout<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:42.820> part<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.120> the

legs throughout this part of the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.490 
legs throughout this part of the
movement

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.390

now these points down because in future
videos<00:04:53.680> we're<00:04:53.800> going<00:04:53.920> to<00:04:53.980> build<00:04:54.250> on<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.550> and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
videos we're going to build on that and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.850 
videos we're going to build on that and
hopefully<00:04:55.570> clean<00:04:55.990> up<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.140> deadlift<00:04:56.470> technique

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
hopefully clean up a deadlift technique

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.409 
hopefully clean up a deadlift technique
and<00:04:57.040> make<00:04:57.190> it<00:04:57.310> as<00:04:57.460> efficient<00:04:57.850> as<00:04:57.970> possible<00:04:58.330> so

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
and make it as efficient as possible so

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.340 
and make it as efficient as possible so
you<00:04:58.480> can<00:04:58.570> lift<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.840> most<00:04:59.020> better<00:04:59.200> way

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
you can lift the most better way

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.200 
you can lift the most better way
possible<00:04:59.710> if<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.490> liked<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.820> video<00:05:00.910> as
