these are perfect treats for parties the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:51.420 
these are perfect treats for parties the
best<00:01:40.450> part<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:41.250> no<00:01:42.250> cooking<00:01:42.729> required<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
best part is no cooking required the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.830 
best part is no cooking required the
reason<00:01:51.820> why<00:01:51.970> we<00:01:52.150> didn't<00:01:52.360> use<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.540> Smarties<00:01:53.380> for

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
reason why we didn't use a Smarties for

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.960 
reason why we didn't use a Smarties for
the<00:01:55.840> steering<00:01:56.320> wheel<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:57.190> because<00:01:57.610> when<00:01:57.790> we

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the steering wheel is because when we

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.780 
the steering wheel is because when we
cut<00:01:58.210> them<00:01:58.450> they<00:01:59.049> just<00:01:59.290> cracked<00:01:59.680> but<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:00.549> use

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
cut them they just cracked but we use

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.740 
cut them they just cracked but we use
the<00:02:00.940> mmm<00:02:01.479> because<00:02:03.090> because<00:02:04.090> they're<00:02:04.330> smaller

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the mmm because because they're smaller

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:20.220 
the mmm because because they're smaller
and<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.930> didn't<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.500> cut<00:02:08.709> them

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.650 

and<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.350> cut<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.860> teddy<00:02:22.370> grahams<00:02:22.580> legs<00:02:23.390> off

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
and then cut the teddy grahams legs off

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:37.120 
and then cut the teddy grahams legs off
you<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.140> eat<00:02:24.350> them

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:52.930
