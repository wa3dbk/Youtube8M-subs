whip and still a little bit of hold you
can<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> pockets<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.630> very<00:00:21.900> defined<00:00:22.260> but

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the channel still looks pretty nice as

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.029 
the channel still looks pretty nice as
it<00:00:24.510> should<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> since<00:00:25.260> they<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> use<00:00:25.859> in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it that should still get a little bit of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.320 
it that should still get a little bit of
hold<00:00:28.340> while<00:00:29.340> having<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:30.090> whip<00:00:30.210> as

string<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.360> actually<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> gate

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
string and I actually like the gate

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
string and I actually like the gate
torque<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.190> head<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.579> pick<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.879> for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
torque it's a head you can pick up for

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119 
torque it's a head you can pick up for
pretty<00:00:54.180> cheap<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.930> old<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
pretty cheap it's kind of old but it's a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
pretty cheap it's kind of old but it's a
really<00:00:56.430> nice<00:00:56.579> shape<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
really nice shape to it I don't like to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
really nice shape to it I don't like to
talk<00:00:57.989> three<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> much<00:00:58.680> that's<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> college

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
talk three that much that's the college

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
talk three that much that's the college
only<00:00:59.670> or<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> college<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.260> high<00:01:01.289> school

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
only or the college in high school

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
only or the college in high school
version<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.010> expec<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> regular

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
version the expec this is just a regular

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
version the expec this is just a regular
torque<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.129> playing<00:01:05.220> summer

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
torque but if you're just playing summer

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.130 
torque but if you're just playing summer
ball<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.000> high<00:01:06.119> school<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.479> club<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.020> something

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
ball or high school or club or something

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.490 
ball or high school or club or something
like<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
like that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
like that
I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> torque<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.030> great

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
I think the torque is a really great

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.399 
I think the torque is a really great
option<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:10.290> cheap<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:12.020> relatively<00:01:13.020> pinched

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
option it's cheap and relatively pinched

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
option it's cheap and relatively pinched
and<00:01:13.619> pretty<00:01:13.920> easy<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> string<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.240> you're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and pretty easy a string so if you're

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820 
and pretty easy a string so if you're
looking<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> head<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.290> spend<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
looking for a head they don't spend a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
looking for a head they don't spend a
lot<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.009> money<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> could<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:17.729> one

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
lot of money you could probably find one

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450 
lot of money you could probably find one
of<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> eBay<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:19.740> somewhere<00:01:20.189> cheap

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of these on eBay or use somewhere cheap

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
of these on eBay or use somewhere cheap
or<00:01:20.640> even<00:01:20.700> new<00:01:21.000> probably<00:01:21.680> tell<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> guys<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
or even new probably tell you guys a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.820 
or even new probably tell you guys a
little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> strung<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.650> see

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
little bit how I strung it you can see

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
little bit how I strung it you can see
I've<00:01:25.950> got<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> top<00:01:26.670> wrapped<00:01:27.390> around<00:01:27.540> like

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I've got this top wrapped around like

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.859 
I've got this top wrapped around like
eight<00:01:28.049> times<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> keep<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> tight

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
eight times and I have to keep it tight

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
eight times and I have to keep it tight
in<00:01:31.020> half<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.619> top<00:01:31.890> holes<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.280> so

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
in half because these top holes are so

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
in half because these top holes are so
huge<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.119> didn't<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> knots<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.350> slip

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
huge I didn't want the knots to slip

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.990 
huge I didn't want the knots to slip
through<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.220> tried<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> stack<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> up

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
through so I really tried to stack it up

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
through so I really tried to stack it up
