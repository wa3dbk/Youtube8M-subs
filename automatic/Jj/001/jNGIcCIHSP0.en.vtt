liposuction<00:05:07.539> they<00:05:08.139> focused<00:05:08.470> on<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> new<00:05:08.770> study

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
liposuction they focused on a new study

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.350 
liposuction they focused on a new study
that<00:05:09.220> says<00:05:09.370> if<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.610> gain<00:05:09.880> weight<00:05:09.910> after

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
that says if you gain weight after

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.510 
that says if you gain weight after
liposuction<00:05:10.780> will<00:05:11.530> redistribute<00:05:11.949> to<00:05:12.340> other

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
liposuction will redistribute to other

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400 
liposuction will redistribute to other
parts<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.030> body<00:05:13.120> is<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:13.960> possible<00:05:14.139> that

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
parts of the body is it possible that

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.020 
parts of the body is it possible that
you<00:05:14.530> maintain<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:15.130> flat<00:05:15.340> stomach<00:05:15.760> but<00:05:15.940> you

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
you maintain the flat stomach but you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.060 
you maintain the flat stomach but you
actually<00:05:16.240> gain<00:05:16.720> weight<00:05:16.930> in<00:05:17.020> other<00:05:17.139> areas<00:05:17.530> ok<00:05:18.039> I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
actually gain weight in other areas ok I

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.339 
actually gain weight in other areas ok I
reviewed<00:05:18.729> that<00:05:18.849> study<00:05:19.180> extensively<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
reviewed that study extensively and and

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.629 
reviewed that study extensively and and
and<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:20.770> brings<00:05:20.919> up<00:05:20.949> another<00:05:21.070> important

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
and it brings up another important

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.070 
and it brings up another important
points<00:05:21.820> first<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.060> all<00:05:22.120> was<00:05:22.210> done<00:05:22.330> on<00:05:22.389> only<00:05:22.630> 14

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
points first of all was done on only 14

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.800 
points first of all was done on only 14
patients<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.770> had<00:05:23.889> surgery<00:05:24.370> but<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:25.330> one

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
patients that had surgery but but one

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.790 
patients that had surgery but but one
thing<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:25.990> didn't<00:05:26.139> really<00:05:26.229> mention<00:05:26.440> is<00:05:26.650> how

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
thing it didn't really mention is how

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.589 
thing it didn't really mention is how
those<00:05:27.039> patients<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.580> if<00:05:27.729> they<00:05:27.880> were<00:05:27.940> valuated

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
those patients and if they were valuated

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.740 
those patients and if they were valuated
for<00:05:29.110> dis<00:05:29.440> proportion<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:31.150> they<00:05:31.510> really

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
for dis proportion and and they really

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.529 
for dis proportion and and they really
weren't<00:05:32.020> for<00:05:32.680> example<00:05:33.160> I<00:05:33.340> don't<00:05:33.639> ask<00:05:34.240> the

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
weren't for example I don't ask the

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.390 
weren't for example I don't ask the
patient<00:05:34.660> what<00:05:34.960> they<00:05:35.110> wanted<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.770> determine

patient what they wanted to I determine
as<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.550> surgeon<00:05:36.789> what<00:05:37.000> really<00:05:37.180> should<00:05:37.419> be<00:05:37.599> done

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
as a surgeon what really should be done

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.140 
as a surgeon what really should be done
to<00:05:38.470> wrap<00:05:38.710> rebalance<00:05:39.280> or<00:05:39.370> body<00:05:39.520> out<00:05:39.729> because<00:05:40.030> if

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
to wrap rebalance or body out because if

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.120 
to wrap rebalance or body out because if
you<00:05:40.240> do<00:05:40.389> if<00:05:40.599> you<00:05:40.690> don't<00:05:40.810> do<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.440> had<00:05:41.590> the

you do if you don't do that you had the

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.620 
you do if you don't do that you had the
risk<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.550> throwing<00:05:43.150> some<00:05:43.360> of<00:05:43.389> the<00:05:43.479> outer

risk of throwing some of the outer

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.120 
risk of throwing some of the outer
balance<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.229> proportion<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.830> that's<00:05:44.979> what

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
balance and proportion and that's what
