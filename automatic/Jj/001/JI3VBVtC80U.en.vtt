disappointment<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> got

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
disappointment with this is when I got

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.130 
disappointment with this is when I got
this<00:01:23.070> machine<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.479> fly<00:01:24.840> backwards

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this machine it would only fly backwards

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.609 
this machine it would only fly backwards
and<00:01:25.950> even<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.400> four<00:01:26.759> full<00:01:27.360> forward<00:01:27.960> controls

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and even with four full forward controls

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
and even with four full forward controls
it<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.759> basically<00:01:30.390> stood<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> standstill

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it just basically stood at a standstill

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
it just basically stood at a standstill
and<00:01:31.770> part<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> problem<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> swash

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and part of the problem is the swash

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.469 
and part of the problem is the swash
plate<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.140> too<00:01:34.380> small<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> double<00:01:36.299> horse

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
plate is too small and double horse

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.520 
plate is too small and double horse
makes<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.140> smaller<00:01:38.270> helicopter<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:40.049> nine<00:01:40.259> one

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
makes a smaller helicopter the nine one

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.410 
makes a smaller helicopter the nine one
zero<00:01:40.590> zero<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.390> just

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
zero zero and I think that they just

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480 
zero zero and I think that they just
used<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.990> swash<00:01:43.320> plate<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> smaller

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
used a swash plate from the smaller

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.149 
used a swash plate from the smaller
helicopter<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.100> one

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
helicopter on this one and this one

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.819 
helicopter on this one and this one
really<00:01:47.610> needs<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.939> much<00:01:48.149> larger<00:01:48.659> swash<00:01:49.560> plate

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
really needs a much larger swash plate

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.359 
really needs a much larger swash plate
in<00:01:50.220> order<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> better<00:01:51.689> control<00:01:52.200> forward<00:01:53.040> and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.240 
forward well enough I put about a half
an<00:02:27.300> ounce<00:02:27.450> or<00:02:27.660> about<00:02:27.840> 14<00:02:28.290> grams<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.830> modeling

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
an ounce or about 14 grams of modeling

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
an ounce or about 14 grams of modeling
clay<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.390> nose<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> canopy

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
clay in the nose of the canopy

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.960 
clay in the nose of the canopy
I<00:02:31.880> also<00:02:32.880> adjusted<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.900> swash<00:02:34.380> plate<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.760> that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I also adjusted the swash plate so that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.850 
I also adjusted the swash plate so that
when<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.600> neutral<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.290> slightly

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
when it's in neutral it's slightly

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.190 
when it's in neutral it's slightly
tilting<00:02:38.400> forward<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.180> modification<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.989> did

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
tilting forward the modification I did

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
tilting forward the modification I did
is<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.410> lengthen<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.160> servo<00:02:42.120> arm<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.140> did

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
is I lengthen the servo arm and I did

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.920 
is I lengthen the servo arm and I did
this<00:02:43.440> by<00:02:43.650> taking<00:02:43.920> an<00:02:44.880> arm<00:02:45.090> from<00:02:45.300> another<00:02:45.540> servo

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
this by taking an arm from another servo

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.520 
this by taking an arm from another servo
and<00:02:46.320> using<00:02:46.980> wire<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.940> attached<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.500> I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and using wire to attached it so that I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.290 
and using wire to attached it so that I
have<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.010> arm<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.530> swashplate<00:02:53.090> now<00:02:54.090> it's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
have the arm to the swashplate now it's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.210 
have the arm to the swashplate now it's
about<00:02:54.390> twice<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.019> distance<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.739> initially

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
about twice the distance that initially

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.729 
about twice the distance that initially
was<00:02:56.489> when<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> servo<00:02:57.660> moves<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.170> causes<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
was when the servo moves it causes the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.220 
was when the servo moves it causes the
swash<00:02:59.040> plate<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.550> move<00:02:59.730> much<00:02:59.940> more<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:01.050> this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
swash plate to move much more and this

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.140 
swash plate to move much more and this
allows<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.739> helicopter<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.489> forward<00:03:02.970> as

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
allows the helicopter to go forward as

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.800 
allows the helicopter to go forward as
well<00:03:03.420> as<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:04.200> Reverse

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810

these modifications because it gives

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.030 
these modifications because it gives
more<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:36.030> feel<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> 6<00:03:37.260> channel<00:03:37.320> than<00:03:37.799> does

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
more of a feel to a 6 channel than does

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.720 
more of a feel to a 6 channel than does
the<00:03:38.190> Volt<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.640> ssin<00:03:38.989> would<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.019> recommend<00:03:40.530> this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
the Volt a ssin would I recommend this

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.050 
the Volt a ssin would I recommend this
well<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.110> paid<00:03:43.110> 71<00:03:43.709> dollars<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.790> that

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
well I paid 71 dollars for that and that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.420 
well I paid 71 dollars for that and that
included<00:03:45.540> shipping<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.470> it's<00:03:46.950> pretty<00:03:47.280> easy

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
included shipping and it's pretty easy

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.780 
included shipping and it's pretty easy
to<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.760> 71<00:03:48.269> dollars<00:03:48.450> worth<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:49.019> fun<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:50.160> this

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
to have 71 dollars worth of fun but this

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.960 
to have 71 dollars worth of fun but this
is<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:52.500> quality<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.950> this<00:03:53.100> machine<00:03:53.519> is<00:03:53.730> far

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
is the quality of this machine is far

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.220 
is the quality of this machine is far
less<00:03:54.239> than<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:55.590> 3d<00:03:56.400> helicopter<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.420> cost

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
less than a 3d helicopter but the cost

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.400 
less than a 3d helicopter but the cost
of<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.500> again<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.769> much<00:03:59.130> less<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.230> it's<00:04:01.230> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
of it again is much less so it's a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.780 
of it again is much less so it's a
decent<00:04:02.060> helicopter<00:04:03.060> if<00:04:03.510> you're<00:04:03.780> planning<00:04:04.019> on

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
decent helicopter if you're planning on

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.000 
decent helicopter if you're planning on
eventually<00:04:05.790> moving<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.900> 3d<00:04:08.000> machine
