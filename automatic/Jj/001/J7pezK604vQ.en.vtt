have<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.330> designed<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.779> game<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.230> game

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
have you designed this game this game

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.960 
have you designed this game this game
world<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.890> best<00:00:08.309> take<00:00:08.460> advantage<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
world to best take advantage of the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.150 
world to best take advantage of the
customization<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.660> these<00:00:09.809> characters<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:11.010> one

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
customization of these characters so one

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.259 
customization of these characters so one
of<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> things<00:00:11.370> we've<00:00:11.670> done<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.940> Skylanders

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
of the things we've done in Skylanders

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.999 
of the things we've done in Skylanders
swap<00:00:12.450> force<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.170> designed<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> levels<00:00:13.889> around

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
swap force is designed the levels around

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.550 
swap force is designed the levels around
this<00:00:14.460> dynamic<00:00:15.059> swap<00:00:15.269> ability<00:00:15.660> feature<00:00:15.900> which

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
this dynamic swap ability feature which

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
this dynamic swap ability feature which
does<00:00:16.800> take<00:00:17.070> into<00:00:17.310> account<00:00:17.609> having<00:00:18.029> over<00:00:18.600> 250

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
does take into account having over 250

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
does take into account having over 250
unique<00:00:19.699> character<00:00:20.699> combinations<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
unique character combinations with the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.540 
unique character combinations with the
swap<00:00:21.720> force<00:00:21.900> characters<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> combat

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
swap force characters and so the combat

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
swap force characters and so the combat
encounters<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> level<00:00:25.380> designs

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
encounters and really the level designs

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.820 
encounters and really the level designs
and<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> environmental<00:00:27.199> paths<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and the environmental paths and the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.169 
and the environmental paths and the
puzzles<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.310> such<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:29.789> based<00:00:30.029> around

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
puzzles and such are all based around

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.580 
puzzles and such are all based around
having<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.720> sense<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.019> discovery<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
having that sense of discovery and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
having that sense of discovery and
having<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.980> sense<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.630> you<00:00:33.630> know<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.930> strategy

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
having a sense of you know just strategy

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380 
having a sense of you know just strategy
if<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> will<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> same<00:00:35.969> time<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> also

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
if you will but at the same time it also

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.729 
if you will but at the same time it also
takes<00:00:36.719> into<00:00:36.840> account<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.410> you'll<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
takes into account that you'll have a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.650 
takes into account that you'll have a
lot<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> new<00:00:38.160> core<00:00:38.370> characters<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
lot of new core characters and one of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.840 
lot of new core characters and one of
the<00:00:39.719> mantras<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.710> team<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.700> never

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the mantras of the team is that we never

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
the mantras of the team is that we never
want<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.300> character<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:43.200> feel<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
want one character to really feel you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.590 
want one character to really feel you
know<00:00:44.190> more<00:00:44.370> special<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.539> know

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
know more special or just you know

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
know more special or just you know
overtly<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.559> powerful<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.070> another<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.550> we

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
overtly more powerful than another so we

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
overtly more powerful than another so we
really<00:00:47.789> designed<00:00:48.180> everything<00:00:48.420> around<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
really designed everything around the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
really designed everything around the
swap<00:00:49.739> force<00:00:49.950> characters<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.750> you<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.840> like

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
swap force characters and you know like

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720 
swap force characters and you know like
in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> previous<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> Giants<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
in the previous game the Giants or just

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.950 
in the previous game the Giants or just
the<00:00:53.789> core<00:00:54.000> characters<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> hate<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.840> have

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the core characters we hate we do have

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.540 
the core characters we hate we do have
these<00:00:55.050> interesting<00:00:55.410> types<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.800> characters<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
these interesting types of characters so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.500 
these interesting types of characters so
it's<00:00:56.670> important<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.239> play<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's important they all play you know to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.490 
it's important they all play you know to
you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> degree<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> they're<00:01:01.410> all

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you know to the degree that they're all

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.310 
you know to the degree that they're all
fun<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.699> Skylanders<00:01:03.359> swap<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.809> us<00:01:03.930> we

layer that we're calling the swap for

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.960 
layer that we're calling the swap for

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.890 
detailed as you might imagine and pretty
interesting<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.459> really<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.420> concept

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
interesting and so really in the concept

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.470 
interesting and so really in the concept
phase<00:03:16.079> when<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.190> talented<00:03:17.790> folks<00:03:18.030> at<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
phase when the talented folks at the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.479 
phase when the talented folks at the
developer<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.280> kind<00:03:20.459> of

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
developer is you know just kind of

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.370 
developer is you know just kind of
brainstorming<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> doing

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
brainstorming and then you know doing

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.259 
brainstorming and then you know doing
sketches<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.190> thinking<00:03:23.489> about<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:24.209> only

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
sketches and thinking about not only

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.539 
sketches and thinking about not only
from<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> visual<00:03:25.859> design<00:03:26.130> what<00:03:26.340> would<00:03:26.459> be

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
from like a visual design what would be

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.849 
from like a visual design what would be
cool<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:26.819> also<00:03:27.120> from<00:03:27.450> an<00:03:27.600> ability<00:03:27.989> standpoint

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
cool but also from an ability standpoint

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.960 
cool but also from an ability standpoint
would<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.160> cool<00:03:29.340> because<00:03:29.459> obviously<00:03:29.639> those

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
would be cool because obviously those

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.699 
would be cool because obviously those
two<00:03:30.120> things<00:03:30.299> need<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.630> go<00:03:30.720> together<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.260> so

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
two things need to go together and so

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.250 
two things need to go together and so
there<00:03:31.889> are<00:03:32.010> many<00:03:32.790> many<00:03:33.060> sort<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.450> designs<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
there are many many sort of designs and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.930 
there are many many sort of designs and
sketches<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:35.010> things<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> development

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
sketches and things that the development

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.550 
sketches and things that the development
team<00:03:35.970> puts<00:03:36.239> together<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:37.319> we<00:03:37.410> just

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
team puts together and then we just

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.110 
team puts together and then we just
start<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.069> narrow<00:03:38.190> down<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.760> start<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.030> go

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
start to narrow down and start to go

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.420 
start to narrow down and start to go
through<00:03:39.329> our<00:03:39.480> iteration<00:03:40.019> process<00:03:40.430> into

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
through our iteration process into

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
through our iteration process into
finding<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.209> know<00:03:42.299> what<00:03:42.540> what<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.139> need

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
finding you know what what is the need

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.140 
finding you know what what is the need
of<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.500> particular<00:03:43.769> character<00:03:44.100> what<00:03:44.940> are<00:03:45.030> going

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
of a particular character what are going

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.699 
of a particular character what are going
to<00:03:45.269> be<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.600> abilities<00:03:46.019> what's<00:03:46.410> new<00:03:46.680> about

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
to be the abilities what's new about

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.680 
to be the abilities what's new about
that<00:03:46.950> character<00:03:47.370> what<00:03:48.150> haven't<00:03:48.359> we<00:03:48.420> seen

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
that character what haven't we seen

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.330 
that character what haven't we seen
before<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.650> we've<00:03:49.769> seen<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.190> previous

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
before that we've seen in the previous

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.680 
before that we've seen in the previous
characters<00:03:50.940> how<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.209> going<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.389> be<00:03:51.480> even

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
characters how is it going to be even

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.599 
characters how is it going to be even
fresh<00:03:52.079> at<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.769> same<00:03:52.980> time<00:03:53.160> how<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.519> going

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
fresh at the same time how is it going

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.430 
fresh at the same time how is it going
to<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.790> varied<00:03:54.239> within<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.750> whole<00:03:54.930> set<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.410> new

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
to be varied within the whole set of new

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.009 
to be varied within the whole set of new
toys<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.459> by<00:03:56.579> introducing<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.329> example<00:03:57.720> 32

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
toys so by introducing for example 32

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.559 
toys so by introducing for example 32
new<00:03:58.260> characters<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:59.010> swap<00:03:59.519> force<00:03:59.819> we<00:04:00.329> need<00:04:00.480> to

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
new characters in swap force we need to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.819 
new characters in swap force we need to
make<00:04:00.690> sure<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.870> each<00:04:01.139> one's<00:04:01.380> interesting

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
make sure that each one's interesting

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.620 
make sure that each one's interesting
each<00:04:02.010> one<00:04:02.190> has<00:04:02.340> its<00:04:02.370> own<00:04:02.609> twist<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.180> so

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
each one has its own twist and so

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.449 
each one has its own twist and so
certainly<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.410> iterative<00:04:04.739> process<00:04:05.250> for

certainly in that iterative process for

certainly in that iterative process for
example<00:04:05.819> in<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:05.970> beginning<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.840> know<00:04:06.930> there

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
example in the beginning you know there

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.629 
example in the beginning you know there
are<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> lot<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.530> tweaks<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:08.069> lot<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.340> things<00:04:08.519> that

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
are a lot of tweaks a lot of things that

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.490 
are a lot of tweaks a lot of things that
we<00:04:09.180> do<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.810> know<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.959> make<00:04:10.169> sure<00:04:10.290> that

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
we do to you know to make sure that

we do to you know to make sure that
they're<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.130> awesome<00:04:11.340> and

they're all awesome and

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.820 
they're all awesome and
and<00:04:12.459> when<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.030> we<00:04:13.150> place<00:04:13.360> while<00:04:13.540> force

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830
