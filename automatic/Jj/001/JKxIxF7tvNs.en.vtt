soybeans<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.310> have<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.610> let<00:00:40.790> soak<00:00:41.320> if<00:00:42.320> you

boiled and blended soybeans and we leave

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.920 
boiled and blended soybeans and we leave
it<00:00:48.830> to<00:00:48.950> be<00:00:51.280> six<00:00:52.280> twelve<00:00:52.610> hours<00:00:52.820> until<00:00:53.600> they<00:00:53.900> are

water about twice the size on these each
length<00:01:07.509> inside<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.690> soybeans<00:01:09.140> there<00:01:09.440> are

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
length inside the soybeans there are

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.010 
length inside the soybeans there are
some<00:01:09.680> enzyme<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.550> when<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.210> when<00:01:11.600> they<00:01:11.720> get<00:01:11.900> in

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
some enzyme that when I when they get in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.950 
some enzyme that when I when they get in
contact<00:01:12.229> with<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.770> air<00:01:12.920> they<00:01:13.910> develop<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.660> very

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
contact with the air they develop a very

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.310 
contact with the air they develop a very
bitter<00:01:15.259> flavor<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.390> we<00:01:17.540> don't<00:01:17.720> want<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.050> if

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
bitter flavor and we don't want that if

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.020 
bitter flavor and we don't want that if
we<00:01:18.650> heat<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.850> about<00:01:19.880> 82<00:01:20.540> degrees<00:01:22.030> Celsius

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
we heat it to about 82 degrees Celsius

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.280 
we heat it to about 82 degrees Celsius
and<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.479> can<00:01:23.600> all<00:01:23.720> all<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:23.990> measures

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
and you can all all the measures

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.840 
and you can all all the measures
measurements<00:01:24.920> here<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.250> find<00:01:25.490> in<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
measurements here you can find in the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.960 
measurements here you can find in the
written<00:01:26.240> recipe<00:01:26.479> also<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.259> temperatures<00:01:28.160> but

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
written recipe also the temperatures but

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.120 
written recipe also the temperatures but
if<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:29.210> heat<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.420> that'll<00:01:30.259> destroy<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.770> enzyme

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
if we heat it that'll destroy the enzyme

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.830 
if we heat it that'll destroy the enzyme
and<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:31.640> won't<00:01:31.820> become<00:01:32.060> Peter<00:01:32.240> when<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:32.600> blend

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and it won't become Peter when we blend

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.719 
and it won't become Peter when we blend
it<00:01:33.050> because<00:01:33.500> otherwise<00:01:33.770> when<00:01:34.130> we<00:01:34.160> blend<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:34.610> it

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
it because otherwise when we blend it it

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.840 
it because otherwise when we blend it it
would<00:01:34.910> come<00:01:34.940> in<00:01:35.300> contact<00:01:35.420> with<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.930> air<00:01:36.850> so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
would come in contact with the air so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.730 
would come in contact with the air so
you<00:01:38.150> need<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.950> is<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> bit<00:01:41.090> different

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you need to this is a bit different

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.110 
you need to this is a bit different
depending<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:43.130> what's<00:01:43.310> what<00:01:43.670> blender<00:01:44.030> you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
depending on what's what blender you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.430 
depending on what's what blender you
have<00:01:44.380> mine<00:01:45.940> can<00:01:46.940> be<00:01:46.970> filled<00:01:47.360> about<00:01:47.630> half<00:01:48.229> way

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
have mine can be filled about half way

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.880 
have mine can be filled about half way
up<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.770> little<00:01:49.340> less<00:01:49.490> than<00:01:49.670> half<00:01:49.729> way<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.890> this

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
up a little less than half way so this

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.730 
up a little less than half way so this
is<00:01:52.010> to<00:01:52.250> two<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.790> these<00:01:52.909> classes<00:01:53.420> then<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.470> start

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
is to two of these classes then I start

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.770 
is to two of these classes then I start
with<00:01:54.890> two<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.370> these<00:01:55.549> glasses<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:58.000> water<00:01:59.000> so

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
with two of these glasses of water so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.770 
with two of these glasses of water so
once<00:02:00.049> one<00:02:00.350> for<00:02:00.830> blending<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.570> think<00:02:02.570> that's

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
once one for blending I think that's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.719 
once one for blending I think that's
that's<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.770> way<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:03.950> works<00:02:04.159> best<00:02:04.400> in<00:02:04.580> my

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
that's the way it works best in my

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.080 
that's the way it works best in my
blender<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.520> add<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.820> more

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.060 

glass<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> water<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.590> do<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.830> carefully

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
glass of water and I do it carefully

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.950 
glass of water and I do it carefully
because<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.730> blender<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.150> still<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:17.840> then<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
because the blender is still on then it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.740 
because the blender is still on then it
has<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.460> right<00:02:20.460> thickness<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.450> finish

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
has the right thickness for the finish

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.960 
has the right thickness for the finish
the<00:02:21.960> soymilk<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:25.290> want<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.700> blend<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.820> for

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the soymilk and you want to blend it for

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.900 
the soymilk and you want to blend it for
as<00:02:27.210> long<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.690> takes<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.140> get<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.430> fine

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
as long as it takes to get it as as fine

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.540 
as long as it takes to get it as as fine
as<00:02:30.150> possible<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.830> blending<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.310> what

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
as possible because the blending is what

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.660 
as possible because the blending is what
extracts<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> flavor

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
extracts the flavor

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.110 
extracts the flavor
well<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.880> under<00:02:36.180> later<00:02:36.480> boiling<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.940> now<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
well that under later boiling but now I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.470 
well that under later boiling but now I
have<00:02:39.360> four<00:02:39.870> parts<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.350> water<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:41.700> two<00:02:41.940> parts<00:02:42.210> of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
have four parts of water to two parts of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.590 
have four parts of water to two parts of
of<00:02:43.080> soak<00:02:43.680> soybeans<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.520> that's<00:02:44.730> that's<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
of soak soybeans and that's that's as it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.090 
of soak soybeans and that's that's as it
should<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:51.560> then<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.650> end<00:02:52.800> up<00:02:52.890> with<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
should be and then you end up with a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.580 
should be and then you end up with a
mixture<00:02:53.490> like<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.170> now<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.410> see

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
mixture like this and now you can see

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.670 
mixture like this and now you can see
why<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:56.040> such<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.700> large<00:02:57.000> large<00:02:57.990> pots<00:02:58.350> now

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
why I have such a large large pots now

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430 
why I have such a large large pots now
that<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> put<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.840> because<00:03:00.840> when<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> starts

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that I put it in because when it starts

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.040 
that I put it in because when it starts
boiling<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.950> grows<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:06.330> sort<00:03:06.990> of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
boiling it really grows it's sort of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.170 
boiling it really grows it's sort of
like<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:08.090> volcano<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.240> soy<00:03:10.020> milk<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> big<00:03:11.910> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
like a volcano of soy milk so a big and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.170 
like a volcano of soy milk so a big and
I<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.960> can<00:03:13.320> say<00:03:13.470> from<00:03:13.530> experience<00:03:13.770> it's<00:03:14.520> pretty

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
I I can say from experience it's pretty

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.600 
I I can say from experience it's pretty
pretty<00:03:15.810> difficult<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.380> clean<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.570> big<00:03:18.570> pot

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
pretty difficult to clean so a big pot

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.800 
pretty difficult to clean so a big pot
and<00:03:20.610> we<00:03:20.760> need<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.090> let<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.330> simmer<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.600> about

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
and we need to let it simmer for about

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:30.800 
and we need to let it simmer for about
thirty<00:03:22.410> minutes

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.030 

and<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:31.960> done<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.160> develops<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.150> skin

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and it's done and it develops the skin

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.310 
and it's done and it develops the skin
in<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.310> Asian<00:03:37.000> countries<00:03:37.360> were<00:03:37.510> there<00:03:37.720> they

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
in the Asian countries were there they

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.610 
in the Asian countries were there they
eat<00:03:38.350> soybean<00:03:39.130> there<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> specialty

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
eat soybean there this is a specialty

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.320 
eat soybean there this is a specialty
but<00:03:41.620> they<00:03:41.800> use<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.460> use<00:03:42.490> this<00:03:42.820> skin<00:03:43.060> for

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
but they use they use this skin for

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.960 
but they use they use this skin for
wrapping<00:03:44.230> food<00:03:44.770> in<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.100> stuff<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.490> that

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
wrapping food in and stuff like that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.380 
wrapping food in and stuff like that
I<00:03:46.050> don't<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.090> need<00:03:49.300> to<00:03:49.360> sieve<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:51.390> the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
I don't so now we need to sieve it the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.210 
I don't so now we need to sieve it the
remaining<00:03:52.780> grits<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.560> beans<00:03:53.770> is<00:03:53.980> called

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
remaining grits of the beans is called

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.460 
remaining grits of the beans is called
Okara<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.630> can<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:55.959> used<00:03:56.170> for<00:03:56.350> cooking

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
Okara and that can be used for cooking

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.060 
Okara and that can be used for cooking
too

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
too

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.490 
too
there's<00:03:57.820> no<00:03:57.970> reason<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.390> throw<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.900> out<00:03:58.990> I<00:03:59.260> use

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
there's no reason to throw it out I use

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.010 
there's no reason to throw it out I use
it<00:03:59.830> for<00:04:00.040> breakfast<00:04:02.220> muesli<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.970> cannot<00:04:04.209> use

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
it for breakfast muesli you cannot use

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.880 
it for breakfast muesli you cannot use
two<00:04:05.230> three<00:04:05.620> layers<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:06.010> cheesecloth<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
two three layers of cheesecloth the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.100 
two three layers of cheesecloth the
strain<00:04:09.160> strain<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.850> as<00:04:10.050> finely<00:04:11.050> as<00:04:11.230> possible

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
strain strain it as finely as possible

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.229 
strain strain it as finely as possible
add<00:04:14.110> a<00:04:14.170> little<00:04:14.500> little<00:04:14.950> bit<00:04:15.160> at<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.310> time<00:04:15.430> let<00:04:16.120> it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
add a little little bit at a time let it

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.290 
add a little little bit at a time let it
drain<00:04:16.480> add<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.780> little<00:04:17.049> more<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.340> forth<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:21.300> have

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
drain add a little more so forth I have

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.060 
drain add a little more so forth I have
a<00:04:22.419> rather<00:04:22.720> large<00:04:22.960> sieve<00:04:23.290> so<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.590> can<00:04:23.770> do<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.950> all

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
a rather large sieve so I can do it all

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.890 
a rather large sieve so I can do it all
in<00:04:24.220> one<00:04:24.370> go

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
in one go

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.060 
in one go
and<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.320> soymilk<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:30.419> leave<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.570> be

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
and this is the soymilk I leave it to be

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.820 
and this is the soymilk I leave it to be
about<00:04:33.070> half<00:04:33.310> an<00:04:33.430> hour<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.669> think<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:34.090> has<00:04:34.300> I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
about half an hour I think this has I

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.159 
about half an hour I think this has I
have<00:04:35.830> left<00:04:36.070> this<00:04:36.540> but<00:04:37.540> there's<00:04:37.690> still<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.930> lot

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
have left this but there's still a lot

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.010 
have left this but there's still a lot
of<00:04:38.200> soymilk<00:04:38.650> left<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:42.360> at<00:04:43.360> this<00:04:43.600> stage<00:04:43.810> it's

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
of soymilk left it at this stage it's

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.010 
of soymilk left it at this stage it's
usually<00:04:44.169> very<00:04:44.380> hot<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:45.340> unless<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.880> got<00:04:46.030> hot

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
usually very hot so unless you got hot

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.920 
usually very hot so unless you got hot
skilled<00:04:47.350> fingers<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:49.150> should<00:04:49.180> probably<00:04:49.540> do

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
skilled fingers you should probably do

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.460 
skilled fingers you should probably do
it<00:04:50.050> like<00:04:50.200> this<00:04:50.410> with<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.540> wooden<00:04:52.540> ladle

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
it like this with a wooden ladle

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.369 
it like this with a wooden ladle
then<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.710> turn<00:04:56.580> over<00:04:56.939> and<00:04:57.090> squeeze<00:04:58.550> and<00:05:00.379> this

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
then just turn over and squeeze and this

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.059 
then just turn over and squeeze and this
is<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.650> aforementioned<00:05:02.340> Okara<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.919> can

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
is the aforementioned Okara and you can

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.589 
is the aforementioned Okara and you can
use<00:05:05.189> it<00:05:05.310> in<00:05:05.430> bread<00:05:05.669> too<00:05:06.000> or<00:05:06.930> mix<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.830> with<00:05:08.039> the

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
use it in bread too or mix it with the

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:15.050 
use it in bread too or mix it with the
mix<00:05:09.599> mix<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.020> with<00:05:10.169> false<00:05:10.409> meat<00:05:12.530> or<00:05:14.030> as<00:05:15.030> a

mix mix it with false meat or as a
measly<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:17.780> had<00:05:18.780> some<00:05:18.960> salt<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.990> sugar<00:05:22.020> and

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
measly I had some salt and the sugar and

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.320 
measly I had some salt and the sugar and
you<00:05:22.680> really<00:05:22.919> do<00:05:23.129> need<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.370> do<00:05:23.639> this<00:05:23.849> otherwise

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
you really do need to do this otherwise
