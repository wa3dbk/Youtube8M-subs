just walking over the boat and share

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.979 
just walking over the boat and share
from<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> top<00:02:55.879> cubes<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.390> wonderful<00:02:57.049> for<00:02:57.080> me

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.580 

this<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> Ceylon<00:03:03.739> adopted<00:03:04.220> insulation<00:03:05.590> this

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
this is a Ceylon adopted insulation this

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.199 
this is a Ceylon adopted insulation this
material<00:03:07.099> where<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.310> homes<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:07.790> called<00:03:08.030> a

poured<00:03:11.599> over<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.900> thoughts<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.349> came<00:03:12.650> there

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
poured over the thoughts that came there

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.710 
poured over the thoughts that came there
and<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.700> allows<00:03:13.879> for<00:03:14.090> any<00:03:14.239> trapped<00:03:14.540> water

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
and that allows for any trapped water

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.899 
and that allows for any trapped water
