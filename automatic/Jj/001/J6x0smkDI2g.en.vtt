00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello to all sunday direction no 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.730
 field for the traditional quinté plus 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.200
 and the royal pavilion price is for 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 horses 5 years and over very tight 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 very experienced on the distance 2950 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.869
 meters they are painters have great 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.400
 track and to analyze this test 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.350
 we welcome france from charles françois 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 charles hello hello hello to all 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.970
 so a test 16 starters enough 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 difficult to decipher but françois 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 charles will help us and offers you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 as a base the 3 cool star yes before 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 all things I would like to point out two 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.489
 interesting aspects in this test 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.079
 the fact that the finish will be second 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.489
 pole anyway what can allow 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.530
 wait- and- see anyway to come back to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.149
 the end but in return that the lily 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 and at zero what should 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 promote horses right now 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.969
 placed and who will have a place at the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.289
 cadence is interesting and it's for 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.390
 that he will place at the head of your 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.780
 selection the 3 report that is the number 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.579
 5 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.870
 exactly this is one of the is one 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.090
 criteria that I retained because the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 number 3 koelster and on horseback very 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.559
 confirmed at this level who performed a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 remarkable come back to compiègne to this 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.220
 opportunity to prove that he has and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 age and well and the other day we 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.159
 maybe was waiting a little better in 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.390
 a test that will serve as a reference 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.250
 we will review the whole if you want 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 good or find also the number 8 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 trout but it had been enough 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 stubborn enough unhappy maybe that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 that this did not more generally 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 the horses the old horses who know 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.780
 read and write are a little shady so 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.310
 it must be okay on the other hand 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.180
 which end of the race of greyhounds that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.159
 had ended in a bang 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.420
 she had stopped the moral winner of 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.680
 this test so this time she 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 will undoubtedly be highly visible to me it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.170
 will no doubt be the favorite of this 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.490
 surely I believe it will still be 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 far to the entrance of the straight line so 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 we're going to see her finish strong at her 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.640
 time to come back put everybody 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 okay he is able to but that's not 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.340
 will not be obvious especially since she has 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.899
 the number 14 in the stalls 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.280
 she will be a little bit far in the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380
 straight line last year if we take 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450
 like race like 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.500
 the senate last year had proved that at 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.439
 the entrance to the straight line the choices 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.770
 the best placed had gotten the share 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.329
 lion 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.979
 you have a crush in this 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.630
 test is the vonn website that goes 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.179
 make his return and will be associated with 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.649
 fabrice veron yes so he does his 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.960
 returned but in the rubric 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.729
 trainings and well his coach 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.450
 indicates the horse is usually ready 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.209
 he sees just 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.950
 so it was a horse that had failed 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.540
 very little last year in a good handicap 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.800
 to chantilly worth 40 ideas in 38 and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.640
 half this time it's pretty good 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.780
 placed and fade 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.610
 fabrice veron took his joker so 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.330
 it's a sign that he still has an idea 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.220
 behind the head 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.380
 even if we assume that it's mostly 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.030
 for the price of leafs with aq washington 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.180
 henri resident Alex Pantall but 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.379
 finally I think he had to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.879
 see also that he had other very 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.689
 good chances in the meeting especially 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.090
 with this number 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.099
 sisvel world who makes his return so 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.780
 with certainly ambitions it is 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.819
 very important to you the bettors of 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.409
 watch if there is a jockey after a 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.030
 joker it is often that he has good 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.319
 chances in the meeting we put it well 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.909
 worth in by hector precisely is 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.599
 completely with an acronym you can 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.329
 find in the table of 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.760
 performance in love this is the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.519
 2.6 side have forgiveness surprises this is the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.439
 2,6 side against him the rat number 15 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.620
 in the stalls exactly then there I 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:02.169
 put on the form of stéphane pasquier 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.530
 who currently is in great confidence 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:07.150
 who is at the top of his art and who I 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.049
 guess that take a gun shot he 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.669
 find yourself quickly in the group 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.870
 of head that horse who can afford 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.810
 to go ahead he managed great 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.669
 performances going in front and if that 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.169
 happens like that as I wish 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.280
 then in the straight line like the 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.169
 brave he will go very far 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.969
 you probably know françois charles 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.030
 truffled our and at liszt house to 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.550
 paris turf 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.720
 as long as it's his first handicap 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.250
 that's what you find or place and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.959
 how at the level of value is good 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.920
 very correctly 40 and a half for a 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.080
 horse who still won a 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.180
 crutch was placed two to whom has 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.709
 competed in high level events with 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.290
 title horses and so for a 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.370
 first handicap it is at a value that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.690
 can allow him to put all the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.890
 world okay me if he had a good 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.560
 place on the rope I think I have them 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.060
 put in the lead and you've gone beyond 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.040
 last output that epic is then 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.260
 that of tarbes it's true is very 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.610
 average we see it finish in perdition 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.930
 recessed but the ground was heavy 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.950
 and I have learned from experience that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.120
 back-to-school races 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.000
 usually put them between 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.120
 parentheses 3 standoff in this test 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.950
 me it's a hard test on the 11th 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.660
 as for montargis the 14 to the essonne and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.070
 the cese deep ocean yes three horses that 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.480
 have good places to rope that 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.370
 bored me a bit so they are able 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.019
 to glean a small accessit to a 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.940
 fourth or fifth place but for 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.140
 me as the petter theorem says 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.919
 they reached their threshold 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.660
 incompetence 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.859
 so I'd rather see them in the second 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.540
 test and I think that when the good 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.220
 horses will fall on their backs and 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.810
 well and the ngo who looked at the others 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.490
 passes and especially when to montargis who 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.720
 worth it to him if he went 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.100
 try to go further 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.180
 at least we have a little knowledge of 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.040
 scenario of this test we know that 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.840
 him he 'll go ahead eva he'll 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.100
 allow the numbers by pressing the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.750
 rooms at the start to do a little bit of 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.160
 trains which would allow trévières to 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.700
 return on the other hand quite good 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.280
 scenario 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.150
 the iem will invest life selection 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.160
 horses for this event 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.050
 so the number 3 koelster I believe because 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.400
 it's still a beta tiercé is 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.620
 well placed in the departure stalls 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.270
 for me say that even if it is a little 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.500
 just to win it's the basis for 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.750
 to be in the first four 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.990
 then number 8 very old well 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.300
 sure the side 2.6 able to win 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.720
 if it goes well the 6th king and the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.030
 world that's very very interesting on 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.530
 the speculative plan the 2- year-old gaston did 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.090
 not spoken but on its value of 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.510
 last summer's deauville it's fine 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.940
 square 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.410
 the xiii then heracles us good place 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.090
 to the rope that goes ahead in my opinion 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.479
 he will be in the game for the phase 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.190
 final 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.990
 the nutty limits this good finisher 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.180
 but I would have preferred on a very 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.230
 flexible and finally the number 15 of carros 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.310
 who the other day in lyon 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.690
 did a performance 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.340
 interesting we will interesting 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.840
 francois charles offers you 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.510
 game tips a coupled winning in 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.160
 taking the 3 late night bass 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.620
 form a base of play on these four 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.250
 other horses behind the 8 the 2 the 6 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.200
 and the 9 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.520
 thank you very much françois charles bas
