 Hello guys, Barry welcome you to my virgin kitchen. Then you have wanted to do some since 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.630
 your own edible lego? Maybe your dog eats it, maybe your children eat it, maybe you eat it, so now 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.020
 can you. These are edible chocolate lego men, great times. 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.030
 Don't get fat, so if you make a Lego cake and you want some little Lego men 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.140
 to it or if you want to kill the desire you have inside you to eat right 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.900
 Lego pieces. You look at one who might have done it when they were younger. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.030
 You need one thing, okay this one a silicone lego form okay, it's very important, link down there 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.379
 to get one and I will also give it away at the end of the video. 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.589
 If you want to try to make it then pause the video now and write down all the ingredients. I 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.170
 if you feel like you can do as I have added some nuts and some food color 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.519
 It is very important to color our chocolate. But it is very easy, it pigs a little, and here's how you do 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.879
 the. So the first thing to do is 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.959
 not to make one at a time, I made a few simple lego men that you want to see then they get 

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:01.959
 filled the marzipan and pressed it down on the body parts, like the arms or the feet or the body, just 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:06.140
 to make some small potions so when we color our chocolate and add it then it will melt 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.190
 and firmly up together so get it laid down and spread out, now you have to take your smelted 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.210
 white chocolate and add food color. So I started with the yellow first 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.870
 just get it here mixed well, so I added it in some small pocket I had shaped. 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.060
 with the marzipan filling, it gets a little gritty but as i say just grab 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.900
 it will also put it in the freezer for 10 minutes just so it can sit down. 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.630
 With the finished marzipan I just had to repeat these steps, so color the white chocolate 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.680
 red and blue respectively scoop out my marzipan pieces, move it where I needed to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.810
 And just fill up the slots to put it all together, also put it back in the freezer. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.550
 10 minutes in the freezer. When I continued and that's the guys when it all is finished so can 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.980
 You pop them out of it, it's lovely cheeky black glaze pretty smile that looks amazing, maybe 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.000
 put them in a row and take some more lego pieces on the side just to strangle it and it 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.420
 tastes really good. I love it, the solitary thing I was 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.479
 a little cleansed of the fact that the heel of the real Lego would not look after it and it looked like 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.890
 more of a turban. So if you want to win this real lego form then there is a link down there 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.870
 to win it. I want you to open Photoshop and turn me into a lego man. Tweeter 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.819
 Me @myvirginkitchen and my favorite I will write to and send you here, just 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.999
 Like all my other competition I will tell you the private because something happened 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.579
 earlier, some people got a little upset about it and started hating a girl 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.150
 who won a form, it was terrible, so I will tell the winner the private just so you know it. 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.989
 Well but tweet me a picture of me in lego style and give them a chance here, We'll see next time. 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.810
