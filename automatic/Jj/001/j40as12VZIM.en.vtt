00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
of color and cosmetically I think it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
of color and cosmetically I think it
goes<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.690> nice<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> gold<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.830> with

tremolo with bent steel saddles this

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.260 
tremolo with bent steel saddles this
really<00:01:53.190> represents<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.789> best<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.119> both

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
really represents the best of both

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.190 
really represents the best of both
worlds<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.780> me<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:57.200> two-point

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
worlds to me also because a two-point

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
worlds to me also because a two-point
tremolo<00:01:58.619> generally<00:01:59.310> speaking<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.879> a<00:01:59.910> lot

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
tremolo generally speaking is a lot

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.469 
tremolo generally speaking is a lot
easier<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.509> set<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.819> it<00:02:02.819> does<00:02:03.000> tend<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
easier to set up and it does tend to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.100 
easier to set up and it does tend to
stay<00:02:03.660> in<00:02:03.690> tune<00:02:03.989> better<00:02:04.709> than<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.099> 6-point<00:02:06.110> but

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
stay in tune better than a 6-point but

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.180 
stay in tune better than a 6-point but
there<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.349> people<00:02:07.470> who<00:02:07.679> really<00:02:07.950> like

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there are people who really like

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.699 
there are people who really like
six-point<00:02:09.030> tremolo<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.560> good

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
six-point tremolo so that that's a good

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.280 
six-point tremolo so that that's a good
thing<00:02:10.920> too<00:02:11.129> as<00:02:11.390> far<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> pickups<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
thing too as far as the pickups go I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.140 
thing too as far as the pickups go I
really<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> sound<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.520> these<00:02:14.640> pickups<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
really like the sound of these pickups a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.949 
really like the sound of these pickups a
lot<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.870> thing<00:02:16.050> I'm<00:02:16.200> struck<00:02:16.530> by<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:17.959> for

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
lot one thing I'm struck by is for

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.140 
lot one thing I'm struck by is for
instance<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> second<00:02:19.980> position<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.700> in

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
instance in the second position and in

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.040 
instance in the second position and in
the<00:02:21.239> fourth<00:02:21.480> position

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the fourth position

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.940 
the fourth position
they<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.769> noise<00:02:23.010> cancelling<00:02:23.670> okay<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.410> we

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
they are noise cancelling okay so if we

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
they are noise cancelling okay so if we
go<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> first<00:02:26.519> position<00:02:27.140> there's<00:02:28.140> almost

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
go to the first position there's almost

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.449 
go to the first position there's almost
zero<00:02:29.360> noise<00:02:30.360> which<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.900> quite<00:02:31.140> remarkable<00:02:31.459> for

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
zero noise which is quite remarkable for

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.570 
zero noise which is quite remarkable for
a<00:02:32.489> pickup<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.209> not<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.900> cancelling<00:02:34.800> so

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
a pickup that is not I'm cancelling so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.250 
a pickup that is not I'm cancelling so
that's<00:02:36.120> something<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.599> consider<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
that's something to consider in the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.809 
that's something to consider in the
sound<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.680> these<00:02:37.769> pickups<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.250> very<00:02:38.459> organic

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
sound of these pickups is very organic

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.330 
sound of these pickups is very organic
it's<00:02:39.120> real<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.390> sort<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.840> elastic<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.739> will

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's real just sort of elastic and will

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.630 
it's real just sort of elastic and will
take<00:02:41.730> what<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.030> give<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.040> anyways<00:02:44.040> here's
