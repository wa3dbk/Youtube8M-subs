first place is just so many games were
coming<00:01:22.119> out<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.450> was<00:01:22.540> impossible<00:01:22.990> to

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
coming out that it was impossible to

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.240 
coming out that it was impossible to
keep<00:01:23.170> track<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.439> what<00:01:23.680> were<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> good<00:01:24.040> ones

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
keep track of what were the good ones

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.530 
keep track of what were the good ones
and<00:01:24.430> what<00:01:24.579> were<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.670> bad<00:01:24.939> ones<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.509> bad

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
and what were the bad ones and the bad

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.390 
and what were the bad ones and the bad
ones<00:01:25.900> were<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.170> overwhelming<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:26.829> people

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
ones were so overwhelming that people

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.530 
ones were so overwhelming that people
just<00:01:27.579> start<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.790> think<00:01:27.970> that's<00:01:28.180> what<00:01:28.360> video

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540
