going to help in steering precision as
we<00:02:29.630> build<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.140> as<00:02:30.530> much<00:02:31.069> vertical<00:02:31.459> compliance

we build in as much vertical compliance

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.870 
we build in as much vertical compliance
into<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.260> front<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> rear<00:02:34.130> end<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.730> are

into the front and the rear end we are

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.120 
into the front and the rear end we are
also<00:02:35.269> looking<00:02:35.660> for<00:02:35.900> plenty<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.380> steering<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
also looking for plenty of steering and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.309 
also looking for plenty of steering and
pedaling<00:02:37.430> stiffness<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.510> by<00:02:38.630> incorporating<00:02:38.900> a

fifteen millimeter thru-axle up front

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.690 
fifteen millimeter thru-axle up front
there<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.840> really<00:02:42.590> allows<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.190> can<00:02:43.430> track

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
there it really allows if I can track

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.390 
there it really allows if I can track
much<00:02:43.970> much<00:02:44.239> better<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:45.440> will<00:02:45.800> fight<00:02:46.220> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
much much better and it will fight the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.580 
much much better and it will fight the
braking<00:02:46.790> forces<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.720> drapes<00:02:48.200> into
