00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 long ago the residents of poti 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.280
 old neighborhood of Teresina 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.309
 found that clay in abundance 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.690
 in the region could be transformed into 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 pieces of art 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 the site's ceramic pole has existed for 50 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.689
 years and is a mandatory stop for 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.850
 tourists visiting the city along the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.529
 of the time tradition has been adding 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.470
 some news 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.750
 since the end of 2012 the artisans of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 cooperative are working on a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.239
 new technique and revolutionized 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.190
 manufacture of ceramics 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.250
 this is the great differential of the new 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.370
 technique instead of clay inconsistency 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.149
 natural sludge is used which is the clay 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 liquid 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.230
 in addition to step-by-step material for 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.680
 making each piece is also 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.360
 different from what allows a production 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.760
 standardized and large scale 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.989
 pound ceramic takes shape of the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.989
 different molds 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 after drying 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.370
 the pieces are finished and are 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.010
 burned from the gas oven 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.540
 finally, each one receives the bath of 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.120
 natural enamel 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.760
 the result are pieces that mix the 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.650
 beauty of rustic material with a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.650
 more sophisticated aesthetics 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.400
 it will only renew our knowledge, right? 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.010
 we arrive at a fair we see 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.450
 this thin and did not know how it was made 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.430
 lighter 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.600
 there now we're able to work 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.480
 with the same key 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.080
 the technique has even more advantages to 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.540
 production can be up to ten times greater 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.970
 Another strong point of the method is that it 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.850
 allows the use of the parts in a 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.460
 microwave for this reason the line 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.730
 utility is more successful than the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.670
 Decorative resistance of objects 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.890
 is also due to a component of clay 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 found in the neighborhood that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.930
 special coloring with this technique 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.270
 also the condition of people also 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.010
 standardize the product so we can 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.050
 do if I want to do without the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 same size I'll do without buying the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.490
 same size and is also the process of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.550
 production is faster too. 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.200
 understood that the old question 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.770
 of the tournament understood everything that is side 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.480
 in hand and the other quality is also very 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.970
 also good in it the question of export 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.250
 because today you are working with this 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.560
 with the utility line and this 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.510
 this product of people's condition 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.120
 this is a utility product will lead to a 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.280
 microwave a handset then understood a 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.780
 so good quality product 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.780
 best ever high quality
