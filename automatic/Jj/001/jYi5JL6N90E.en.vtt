00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
dragon ball z game but honestly to me I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.970 
dragon ball z game but honestly to me I
would<00:00:42.899> say<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> ultimate<00:00:43.440> Tenkaichi<00:00:43.860> did

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
would say the ultimate Tenkaichi did

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.410 
would say the ultimate Tenkaichi did
look<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> best<00:00:44.370> even<00:00:44.700> though<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
look the best even though if it was the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
look the best even though if it was the
worst<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.469> few<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:46.980> thinking

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
worst out of the few that I'm thinking

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.720 
worst out of the few that I'm thinking
of<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> best-looking<00:00:49.489> ultimate<00:00:50.489> xie

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
of it was the best-looking ultimate xie

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
of it was the best-looking ultimate xie
chi<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.120> did<00:00:51.300> look<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> best<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> all

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
chi really did look the best out of all

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.310 
chi really did look the best out of all
of<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.370> again<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:54.690> had<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
of them but then again what had the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
of them but then again what had the
better<00:00:55.469> art<00:00:55.770> style<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.449> burst

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
better art style now I think that burst

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
better art style now I think that burst
Limit<00:00:57.899> might<00:00:58.050> win<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.350> category<00:00:58.680> because

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
Limit might win in that category because

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
Limit might win in that category because

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
looked a lot like our be too but it just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
looked a lot like our be too but it just
had<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:26.729> less<00:01:26.909> shading<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.630> wasn't<00:01:27.900> as

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
had a lot less shading and it wasn't as

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.940 
had a lot less shading and it wasn't as
sharp<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.530> RB<00:01:29.070> 2<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:31.229> honest<00:01:31.500> opinion<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
sharp as RB 2 now in my honest opinion I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.230 
sharp as RB 2 now in my honest opinion I
think<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.310> burst<00:01:32.549> limit<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think that burst limit would be the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.539 
think that burst limit would be the
perfect<00:01:33.630> contender<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.890> burst<00:01:35.250> Limit

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
perfect contender because burst Limit

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.399 
perfect contender because burst Limit
wasn't<00:01:36.240> made<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.570> late<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> generation

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
wasn't made that late in the generation

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.249 
wasn't made that late in the generation
and<00:01:37.850> if<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.000> polished<00:01:39.600> enough<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.990> think

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and if they polished enough I think

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
and if they polished enough I think
that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> could<00:01:40.500> look<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.100> nice<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that I could look really nice on the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
that I could look really nice on the
next<00:01:42.060> generation<00:01:42.570> consoles<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.170> maybe<00:01:43.680> even

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
next generation consoles and maybe even

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.499 
next generation consoles and maybe even
on<00:01:44.040> pc<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.970> decided<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> put

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
on pc if they actually decided to put

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
on pc if they actually decided to put
them<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.070> just<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.579> be

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
them on I just think that that would be

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.450 
them on I just think that that would be
a<00:01:47.759> great<00:01:48.270> idea<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.780> put<00:01:49.140> those<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> pc<00:01:50.130> or

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
a great idea to put those on the pc or

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.179 
a great idea to put those on the pc or
put<00:01:50.790> him<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.030> new<00:01:51.420> consoles<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:53.009> could

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
put him on the new consoles it could

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
put him on the new consoles it could
really<00:01:53.280> show<00:01:53.640> how<00:01:53.880> good<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> dragon<00:01:54.600> ball<00:01:54.689> z

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
really show how good the dragon ball z

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.550 
really show how good the dragon ball z
games<00:01:54.960> could<00:01:55.200> look<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.350> i

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
games could look so for all of this i

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.020 
games could look so for all of this i
would<00:01:58.829> say<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.130> i<00:01:59.369> would<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.729> want

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
would say that i would really want

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.530 
would say that i would really want
something<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.479> shreve<00:02:00.930> axes<00:02:02.060> rb3<00:02:03.060> project

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
something like shreve axes rb3 project

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 
something like shreve axes rb3 project
because<00:02:04.229> she<00:02:04.500> vexes<00:02:04.649> rb3<00:02:05.159> project<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
because she vexes rb3 project kind of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
because she vexes rb3 project kind of
mixes<00:02:06.240> burst<00:02:06.570> limit<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.020> RB<00:02:07.320> 2<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:07.829> least

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
mixes burst limit with RB 2 or at least

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.630 
mixes burst limit with RB 2 or at least
the<00:02:08.220> way<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> looked<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> does

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the way it looked kind of does

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.330 
the way it looked kind of does
it<00:02:10.119> makes<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.539> look<00:02:10.780> very<00:02:10.840> anime<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.190> it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
it makes it look very anime like and it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.330 
it makes it look very anime like and it
also<00:02:12.640> makes<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.450> seem<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.740> little<00:02:15.040> bit<00:02:15.220> less

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
also makes it seem a little bit less

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.040 
also makes it seem a little bit less
proportion<00:02:15.910> like<00:02:16.270> bursal<00:02:16.690> bit<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.840> way<00:02:16.930> it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
proportion like bursal bit the way it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.260 
proportion like bursal bit the way it
looked<00:02:17.290> was<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> little<00:02:18.040> bit<00:02:18.220> weird<00:02:18.850> sometimes

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
looked was a little bit weird sometimes

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.210 
looked was a little bit weird sometimes
some<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> cutscenes<00:02:20.830> could<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.190> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
some of the cutscenes could have a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.190 
some of the cutscenes could have a
little<00:02:21.430> bit<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.700> weird<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.300> motion<00:02:22.959> or<00:02:23.110> it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
little bit of a weird I motion or it

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.780 
little bit of a weird I motion or it
could<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:23.319> look<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.590> little<00:02:23.680> bit<00:02:23.830> weird<00:02:24.010> but

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
could just look a little bit weird but

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.970 
could just look a little bit weird but
when<00:02:25.000> Goku<00:02:25.810> transforming<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.440> super<00:02:26.740> saying

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
when Goku transforming the super saying

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.520 
when Goku transforming the super saying
against<00:02:27.220> Frieza<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.940> looks<00:02:28.810> really<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.470> in

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
against Frieza that looks really good in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.380 
against Frieza that looks really good in
burst<00:02:29.800> limit<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.430> think<00:02:30.670> if<00:02:30.730> they<00:02:30.850> polished

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
burst limit and I think if they polished

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.360 
burst limit and I think if they polished
that<00:02:31.480> engine<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.080> little<00:02:32.350> bit<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.650> make<00:02:33.340> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
that engine up a little bit and make a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.650 
that engine up a little bit and make a
new<00:02:33.550> Dragon<00:02:33.880> Balls<00:02:34.000> eating<00:02:34.209> for<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.360> next<00:02:34.540> gen

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
new Dragon Balls eating for the next gen

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.540 
new Dragon Balls eating for the next gen
columns<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.080> could<00:02:35.230> look<00:02:35.350> great<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:36.459> not

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
columns it could look great it's not

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.770 
columns it could look great it's not
about<00:02:36.730> three<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.120> them<00:02:37.270> i<00:02:37.420> would<00:02:37.600> say<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
about three of them i would say that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.270 
about three of them i would say that
verse<00:02:38.080> 1<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.350> would<00:02:38.500> probably<00:02:38.739> be<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> best

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
verse 1 it would probably be the best

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.490 
verse 1 it would probably be the best
thing<00:02:39.520> for<00:02:39.580> Namco<00:02:40.390> Bandai<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.780> take<00:02:41.080> away<00:02:41.290> from

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
thing for Namco Bandai to take away from

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.890 
thing for Namco Bandai to take away from
that<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.950> put<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:42.970> into<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.150> new<00:02:43.300> dragon<00:02:43.600> ball<00:02:43.720> z

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that and put it into a new dragon ball z

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.479 
that and put it into a new dragon ball z
game<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.260> think<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.920> could<00:02:44.950> look<00:02:45.160> really

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
game I think that it could look really

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.220 
game I think that it could look really
nice<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.000> next<00:02:46.180> gen<00:02:46.330> consoles<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.050> what<00:02:47.170> do

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
nice in the next gen consoles so what do

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.420 
nice in the next gen consoles so what do
you<00:02:47.290> guys<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.470> about<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.220> think

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
you guys think about this do you think

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.009 
you guys think about this do you think
that<00:02:48.550> ultimate<00:02:49.150> Tenkaichi<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.870> best

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
that ultimate Tenkaichi with the best

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.140 
that ultimate Tenkaichi with the best
contender<00:02:50.470> for<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.100> next<00:02:51.310> gen<00:02:51.430> consoles<00:02:51.850> do

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
contender for the next gen consoles do

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.640 
contender for the next gen consoles do
you<00:02:52.209> think<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.570> radiant<00:02:52.900> last<00:02:53.050> tues<00:02:53.320> art

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
you think that radiant last tues art

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.930 
you think that radiant last tues art
style<00:02:53.920> would<00:02:54.130> be<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> best<00:02:54.489> for<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> next
