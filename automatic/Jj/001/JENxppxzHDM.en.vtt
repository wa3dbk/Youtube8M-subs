00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
jerseys and this is actually our first

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.719 
jerseys and this is actually our first
game<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.030> Legere<00:01:57.390> Z<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.049> whatever

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
game with Legere Z so you know whatever

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
game with Legere Z so you know whatever
but<00:01:59.729> anyways<00:02:00.390> yeah<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> talk<00:02:01.649> about

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but anyways yeah I want to talk about

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.490 
but anyways yeah I want to talk about
the<00:02:02.040> game<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.719> true<00:02:03.960> performance<00:02:04.409> skating

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the game so the true performance skating

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.350 
the game so the true performance skating
is<00:02:05.009> definitely<00:02:05.610> noticeable<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.210> you're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
is definitely noticeable when you're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.710 
is definitely noticeable when you're
playing<00:02:06.509> eashl<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.789> example<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.509> you're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
playing eashl so for example if you're

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
playing eashl so for example if you're
trying<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.080> make<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> sharp<00:02:10.800> turn<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.220> you're

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
trying to make a sharp turn when you're

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.290 
trying to make a sharp turn when you're
going

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
going

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.270 
going
with<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> lot<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.870> momentum<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.710> gonna<00:02:14.130> be

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
with a lot of momentum it's gonna be

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.310 
with a lot of momentum it's gonna be
difficult<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.030> that's<00:02:15.390> realistic<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.020> in

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
difficult so that's realistic because in

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.910 
difficult so that's realistic because in
real<00:02:16.590> life<00:02:16.920> um<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.110> if<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.500> play<00:02:19.710> hockey

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
real life um if you if you play hockey

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.250 
real life um if you if you play hockey
no<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.460> definitely<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.450> easy<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.930> make<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
no it's definitely not easy to make a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.230 
no it's definitely not easy to make a
quick<00:02:22.740> turning<00:02:23.220> look<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.970> know<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
quick turning look at that I know you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.730 
quick turning look at that I know you
guys<00:02:24.420> probably<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.960> saw<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.260> clip<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.680> I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
guys probably just saw that clip that I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.530 
guys probably just saw that clip that I

posted up on this channel before this
that<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> don't<00:02:29.130> know<00:02:29.310> what

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
that was just there I don't know what

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.920 
that was just there I don't know what
that's<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.790> new<00:02:29.940> feature<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.570> game<00:02:30.720> or

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.820 
that's a new feature in the game or
something<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.290> where<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.710> can<00:02:31.800> just

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
something like that where you can just

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.500 
something like that where you can just
one<00:02:32.250> time<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.580> into<00:02:32.790> your<00:02:32.910> own<00:02:33.000> yep<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.480> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
one time it into your own yep that is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.620 
one time it into your own yep that is
just<00:02:34.040> hilarious<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:35.820> were<00:02:35.940> laughing<00:02:36.210> at

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
just hilarious that we were laughing at

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.350 
just hilarious that we were laughing at
that<00:02:36.660> for<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> good<00:02:37.620> five<00:02:37.860> minutes<00:02:38.100> there<00:02:38.490> but

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that for a good five minutes there but

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.380 
that for a good five minutes there but
yeah<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:40.260> was<00:02:41.130> saying<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.580> true<00:02:42.000> performance

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
yeah I was saying this true performance

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.150 
yeah I was saying this true performance
skating<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.900> definitely<00:02:43.320> noticeable<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.950> mean

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
skating is definitely noticeable I mean

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.190 
skating is definitely noticeable I mean
it's<00:02:44.640> harder<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.210> turn<00:02:45.510> when<00:02:45.720> you're<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's harder to turn when you're going a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.410 
it's harder to turn when you're going a
lot<00:02:46.350> faster<00:02:46.620> which<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.790> good<00:02:48.030> because<00:02:48.210> that's

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
lot faster which is good because that's

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.910 
lot faster which is good because that's
realistic<00:02:48.840> because<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:49.590> from<00:02:49.860> firsthand

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
realistic because I know from firsthand

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.190 
realistic because I know from firsthand
experience<00:02:50.510> when<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.600> going<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.960> lot<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
experience when I'm going with a lot of

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.110 
experience when I'm going with a lot of
momentum<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.950> need<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.220> make<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> sharp<00:02:53.940> turn

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
momentum and I need to make a sharp turn

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.620 
momentum and I need to make a sharp turn
ah<00:02:55.070> it's<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.760> harder<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.600> because

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
ah it's just it's harder to do because

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.150 
ah it's just it's harder to do because
of<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.290> amount<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.710> speed<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:58.920> you're

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
of the amount of speed that you're

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.430 
of the amount of speed that you're
carrying<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.610> that's<00:03:00.450> realistic<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.200> sense

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
carrying so that's realistic in a sense

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.030 
carrying so that's realistic in a sense
and<00:03:02.360> while<00:03:03.360> hope<00:03:03.750> checks<00:03:04.050> are<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.620> strong

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
and while hope checks are just so strong

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.860 
and while hope checks are just so strong
in<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.430> game<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.090> unreal<00:03:06.540> i<00:03:06.570> think

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
in this game that it is unreal i think

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.750 
in this game that it is unreal i think
they're<00:03:06.960> gonna<00:03:07.080> have<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.350> patch<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
they're gonna have to patch that just a

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.150 
they're gonna have to patch that just a
tiny<00:03:09.030> bit<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:09.930> good<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.470> they're

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
tiny bit you know it's good but they're

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.310 
tiny bit you know it's good but they're
just<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.520> little<00:03:12.150> bit<00:03:12.300> overpowered<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.590> uh

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
just a little bit overpowered and uh

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.320 
just a little bit overpowered and uh
that's<00:03:16.320> all<00:03:16.470> pretty<00:03:16.739> much<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.520> gameplay<00:03:18.150> i

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
that's all pretty much for gameplay i

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.110 
that's all pretty much for gameplay i
noticed<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.770> replays<00:03:20.220> are<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.640> freaking
