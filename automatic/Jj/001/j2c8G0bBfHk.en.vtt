00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.950
In the comments of one of my quantitative
research videos I was asked: “how do you

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.860
support your study relationship based on a
theoretical or conceptual framework?”

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.960
That is a great question!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.970
There has been a large push from academic
institutions and journals in recent years

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.150
for the explicit use of these frameworks in
research studies.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.390
Theoretical or conceptual frameworks are used
to support research in many ways.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.000
More than one framework may even be useful
in your research.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.480
How they guide the development of a research
study depends on your question and research

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.390
design.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.540
Sometimes you need to know your theory before
you begin your study and other times it makes

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.420
more sense to select it after data collection.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.070
I always tell my students that the research
question should drive all of the decisions

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.420
in a study.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.370
Keep in mind, however, that sometimes your
question actually comes from the theoretical

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.370
framework.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.840
If your research is about testing, confirming,
refuting, expanding on, refining or adding

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.590
to an existing theory then you need to be
sure you know what it is before the study

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.869
begins and I would explain that theory in
the literature review section of your paper.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.719
When you get to the results section of that
paper it would likely make sense to organise

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.600
your results in the same way the theory is
organised.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.290
In the discussion section you can then examine
how your results and other literature either

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.799
support or refute the theory.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.029
Sometimes you will not set out to discuss
a particular theory.

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:38.899
A theoretical or conceptual framework will
still be useful to support your question or

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.990
organise your findings.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.579
When using a theory to support your question
the theory needs to relate to the reason why

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.170
you are doing the study.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.320
In Killam and Heerschap (2012) we used a theory
about force field analysis to justify examining

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.329
student perceptions of challenges to their
learning in the clinical setting.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.939
Basically, the theory talks about how change
occurs when positive forces outweigh negative

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:02.939
ones.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.460
Therefore, if educators want students to be
safe we need to remove barriers to students

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.189
practicing safely.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.629
In order to remove these barriers we need
to know what they are.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.000
And there you have how the theory supported
the reason for asking the question.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.540
Quite honestly we added this theory in after
the study was completed because the journal

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.290
required that we have one.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.159
Our selected methodology, however, supported
conducting the study without a theoretical

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.510
frame up-front.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.799
We developed our own model to explain the
findings.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.519
The theory did work well with discussion section
that had already been written for the paper.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.379
I have done a few qualitative studies where
I wanted to examine a topic broadly and have

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.900
subsequently found a theory that helped me
organise and explain the findings.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.260
For example, in Killam and Carter (2010) the
Ecological model was used to organise the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.989
findings of a literature review about challenges
that student nurses face while on clinical

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.450
placement in rural settings.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.540
We did not select the Ecological Model as
a lens until after the review was completed

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.650
and we were in the process of analysing the
data.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.969
You can look at this article for free by clicking
on the link below this video.

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.659
Notice that the Ecological Model is introduced
in the literature review, used in the findings

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.750
section to organise the collected data and
again in the discussion.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.920
Originally we had used all the headings from
the model in the discussion section but due

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.939
to space limitations we had to condense it.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.890
When writing it up we did link the selection
of the framework to the question.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.879
You will find that if you select the right
framework the question and findings will fit

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.129
nicely with it and the entire paper will flow
nicely, making a high quality product.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.650
If your research is designed to generate a
new theory it would make sense that you don’t

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.200
know what it is before you begin.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.489
If so, you will want to explain the concepts
you are examining in the literature review.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.689
In your findings you would then build the
case for your theory based on your study data.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.180
Then in the discussion you would talk about
how pre-existing literature also supports

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.629
your theory.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.230
Another use for theory is to explain the culture
of the group being studied or the worldview

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.799
of the researcher.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.010
In qualitative studies it is useful to know
these things when assessing the quality and

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.830
transferability of the study.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.730
Sometimes studies will present a conceptual
framework, which may include discussion of

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.570
multiple views of a particular concept like
in Killam et al. (2012).

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.790
The entire paper still flows because it is
about one topic but there is no clear pre-existing

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.600
theory supporting the entire paper.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
What other ways have you seen theoretical
or conceptual frameworks used to support study

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.070
relationships?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.920
Do you think journals should require a theoretical
framework in publications?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.430
Why or why not?

Videos are posed on Thursdays as often as
I can.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.840
Right now I have a baby at home so they are
not coming out weekly but hopefully in about

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.420
February of 2014 they will start coming out
weekly again.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.940
Thank you!
