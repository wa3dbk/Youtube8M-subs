two gtx 460 s and I five overclocked and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.080 
two gtx 460 s and I five overclocked and
what<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.689> shot<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.230> any<00:00:31.410> way<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.250> basically

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
what now shot in any way so basically

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
what now shot in any way so basically
I'm<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> printing<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:34.680> I've

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
I'm just going to printing it now I've

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
I'm just going to printing it now I've
only<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:36.590> set<00:00:38.059> for<00:00:39.059> seven<00:00:39.540> eight<00:00:39.629> seventy

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

right<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> clock<00:00:47.460> settings<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.890> GPU

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
right the clock settings are the GPU

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
right the clock settings are the GPU
clock<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.750> 1150<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.890> memory<00:00:53.640> clock<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.360> a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.660 

well<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.230> thought<00:02:29.470> house<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.460> normal

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
well I thought house is on as normal

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.350 
well I thought house is on as normal
players<00:02:31.300> go<00:02:31.660> back<00:02:32.520> yep

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:53.820 

bangkok<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:42.270> see<00:02:43.270> when<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.450> comes<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.780> with

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.250 

I<00:02:54.570> run<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.010> passage<00:02:57.010> report<00:02:57.400> 140<00:02:58.390> averages

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
I run in the passage report 140 averages

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.530 
I run in the passage report 140 averages
or<00:02:59.410> 218

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:04:00.580 

so<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.379> goes

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:53.390 

you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.850 

right<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.949> really<00:04:55.949> 14.9<00:04:56.820> frames<00:04:57.210> per<00:04:57.389> second

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
right a really 14.9 frames per second

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.450 
right a really 14.9 frames per second
the<00:04:59.120> maximum<00:05:00.120> again<00:05:00.540> 250<00:05:01.500> average<00:05:01.830> hundred

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the maximum again 250 average hundred

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.140 
the maximum again 250 average hundred
and<00:05:02.639> 5.1<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:04.440> FPS<00:05:05.449> is<00:05:06.449> a<00:05:06.770> 83.3<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.580> last<00:05:08.820> bit

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
and 5.1 the FPS is a 83.3 the last bit

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.580 
and 5.1 the FPS is a 83.3 the last bit
and<00:05:10.160> there<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.250> go<00:05:11.340> rank<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:12.030> yet<00:05:12.449> again<00:05:12.750> well

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
and there you go rank a yet again well
