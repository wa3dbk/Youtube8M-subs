00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello guys with you drive today I 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.470
 I just want to tell you 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.269
 fucking Easter eggs remember in the past 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.880
 video about underwater easter eggs where I am 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.009
 showed the plane sunken I said 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 that there is a bay near where I am 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.630
 a submerged tank so i got there 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 and own saw it flooded 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.369
 a tank but a little more sailed a couple of meters 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 I found a lot of different things and that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.710
 Immediately I want to say what I found means 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 found two tanks four trucks plow from 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.840
 combine but it is very similar and very much 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.340
 different piece of iron when I just sailed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.890
 expected where only this one is small 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 little tank well I was just shocked 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 when I saw a whole army sunken 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.340
 technology I can not say that here 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.160
 specifically happened either sank here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.050
 ship with military equipment but ship 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.760
 there is no here or i really don't know how 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 another way to explain how this 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 the convoy turned out to be under water and before the beginning I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 naturally showed places on the map if 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 you want to get there and let's 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 little by little what I found here 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.610
 the first tank for which own 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.770
 here and sailed to see the second tank 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.869
 world war remember this is american 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.520
 Sherman what he was under water in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.650
 Basically nothing unusual but this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.930
 interesting since during the second world 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 wars many ships were sunk and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.229
 accordingly the technique of them could 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.549
 just roll out 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.500
 and sink but I do not know how to explain 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.840
 modern trucks modern 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 tanks as they got here and immediately 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 there is one more question how are they but 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 or in the same place and sank a few 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.990
 tens of years ago a tank with a second 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 world war the place is clearly something in itself 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.790
 hides and it seems to me that there need 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.009
 just more detail swim and can 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.860
 be that find something more worthwhile 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.960
 more exciting 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 and still has not been updated 118 on 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.180
 old console i don't understand why u 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.400
 I had a preload update then 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.590
 there is before downloading the update 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.540
 in about a day there is a reboot there 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.810
 some files 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 I was waiting for a natural 1.18 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 update but where is it possible and something 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.370
 confusing and if you have this information 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 write in comments about this 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.240
 because i'm starting on the sly 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.720
 get upset and and gave up on 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.610
 rockstar 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.980
 especially after the console 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.020
 The new generation did not add very much 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.209
 New Easter eggs and a lot of new 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.730
 opportunities so if you have 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.890
 any information on the date 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.140
 update output to old console or 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.250
 in general, will she write to please 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 comments 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.280
