or<00:02:34.599> actually<00:02:35.110> not<00:02:35.909> really<00:02:36.909> mistakes<00:02:37.540> per<00:02:37.900> se

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
or actually not really mistakes per se

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.600 
or actually not really mistakes per se
for<00:02:39.579> it<00:02:39.700> for<00:02:39.909> example<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:41.319> might<00:02:41.799> forget<00:02:42.280> an

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
for it for example you might forget an

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.160 
for it for example you might forget an
appointment<00:02:43.540> or<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.019> might<00:02:44.879> make<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:45.910> mistake

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
appointment or you might make a mistake

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.030 
appointment or you might make a mistake
in<00:02:47.250> calculating<00:02:48.250> or<00:02:48.609> in<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.530> might<00:02:50.799> give<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
in calculating or in you might give a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.170 
in calculating or in you might give a
speech<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.879> say<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.900> wrong<00:02:53.109> thing<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.730> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
speech and say the wrong thing and it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.580 
speech and say the wrong thing and it
may<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.450> simply<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.760> physical<00:03:01.019> failure<00:03:02.019> where

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
may be simply a physical failure where

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.520 
may be simply a physical failure where
the<00:03:02.709> brain<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.909> know<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.480> memory<00:03:04.750> fails<00:03:05.230> you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the brain you know the memory fails you

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.390 
the brain you know the memory fails you
or<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:07.659> know<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.500> organic<00:03:09.190> nature

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
or you know that the the organic nature

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.119 
or you know that the the organic nature
of<00:03:09.879> our<00:03:10.090> being<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.909> in<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.329> way<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:13.959> so<00:03:14.129> I

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
of our being is is in that way and so I

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.520 
of our being is is in that way and so I
think<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.269> important<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> understand<00:03:17.319> that

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
think it's important to understand that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.729 
think it's important to understand that
oftentimes<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:18.840> instead<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.900> learning<00:03:20.169> from

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
oftentimes we instead of learning from

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.220 
oftentimes we instead of learning from
our<00:03:21.069> mistakes<00:03:22.919> actually<00:03:23.919> feel<00:03:24.250> guilty<00:03:24.819> about

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
our mistakes actually feel guilty about

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.690 
our mistakes actually feel guilty about
those<00:03:26.340> situations<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.459> are<00:03:27.669> not

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
those situations that are not

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.490 
those situations that are not
necessarily<00:03:28.569> our<00:03:28.780> fault

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
necessarily our fault

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.330 
necessarily our fault
and<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:31.290> think<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.620> an<00:03:32.709> important<00:03:33.040> part<00:03:33.190> of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
and I think this is an important part of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.099 
and I think this is an important part of
learning<00:03:33.700> from<00:03:33.879> our<00:03:34.000> mistakes<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.629> well<00:03:34.810> that

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
learning from our mistakes as well that

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.530 
learning from our mistakes as well that
we<00:03:35.319> don't<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.919> most<00:03:36.400> important<00:03:36.879> point<00:03:37.120> isn't

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
we don't the most important point isn't

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.750 
we don't the most important point isn't
that<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:38.200> made<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> mistake

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
that you made a mistake

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.869 
that you made a mistake
the<00:03:40.269> important<00:03:40.989> point<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.919> the<00:03:42.489> clear

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
the important point is is the clear

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.490 
the important point is is the clear
awareness<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.599> understanding<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:44.349> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
awareness and understanding of the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.900 
awareness and understanding of the
situation<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:46.000> if<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.139> if<00:03:47.500> anger<00:03:48.160> arises<00:03:48.760> and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
situation so if you if anger arises and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.059 
situation so if you if anger arises and
you<00:03:49.030> agreed<00:03:49.449> arises<00:03:50.079> in<00:03:50.199> your<00:03:50.349> delusion<00:03:50.889> and

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
you agreed arises in your delusion and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.610 
you agreed arises in your delusion and
ego<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:51.819> on<00:03:51.989> arises<00:03:52.989> in<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:53.440> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
ego and so on arises in you it's the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.800 
ego and so on arises in you it's the
ability<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.099> catch<00:03:54.489> this<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.389> it<00:03:55.540> and

ability to catch this and to see it and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.400 
ability to catch this and to see it and
to<00:03:56.709> adjust<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.970> mind<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.569> create<00:03:58.900> wisdom

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
to adjust the mind and to create wisdom

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and to remove those states if something

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.979 
and to remove those states if something
happens<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.160> causes<00:04:03.940> people<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.299> get<00:04:04.510> angry

not our fault often time

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.920 
not our fault often time
this<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.340> nature<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.180> reality<00:04:30.900> so

because the too often we think learning
from<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.380> mistake<00:05:43.650> is<00:05:43.830> simply<00:05:44.160> hating<00:05:44.550> and

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060
