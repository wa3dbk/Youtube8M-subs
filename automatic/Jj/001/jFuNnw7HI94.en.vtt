00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.800
 hello to all youtube friends like 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.960
 is in this day I bring you this 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.480
 new video where I'm going to show you two 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.119
 great tweets for your blog screen 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.860
 that will make it look much more elegant such 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.020
 and as you can see on the screen 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.590
 the first tweet that I show you 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.540
 allows you to set the date and time a bit 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.340
 more discreet as you can see 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.890
 here it looks much smaller what it is 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.350
 the clock and likewise on the date 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.670
 in the bottom part I have the second 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.469
 tweet which will allow us 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 unlock our device a 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.370
 completely different form we what 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.550
 The only thing we have to do is press 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.350
 this little circle and select some of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.420
 the four applications that we have here 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.340
 for example if I select camera 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.500
 logically it will direct me to the camera 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.720
 I can select music facebook or 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.940
 twitter are the applications like 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.590
 shortcuts I also have the option 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.660
 of just unlocking our 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.239
 device the normal way without that 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.579
 send us to any application or we can 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.920
 have him send us just like I said 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.200
 to twitter as you can see in your 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.550
 screen as you can see are two tweets 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.230
 what are they going to do to our device 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.990
 much prettier and let's go 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.610
 how to download them to download 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.560
 these tweets we're just going to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 have to go to cydia once inside 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.930
 cydia we are going to drive after 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.940
 we will go to sources edit add and 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.400
 let's add the iphone repository 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.720
 Neame puntocom diagonal riposta I leave 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.790
 on your screen and also on the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.560
 description they give in adding source and 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 I can cancel it because I already have it 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.410
 we are going to look for and we will look for 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.420
 first tweet that is subtle the script well 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.730
 that we are going to place it here and we 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.890
 let's select this one that says I'm 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.100
 7 is this that we have here ok we give it 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.350
 tap we put you in install and in 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.270
 confirm how you can notice this package 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.040
 it's from the iphone repo this one only 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 you can find it there and it seems to me that 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.810
 it is also pay or good has a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.570
 cost and if you want to buy it and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.360
 they really like the cost of this tweet 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.150
 it's one dollar so you know if you 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.250
 interesting the second tweet is called jelly 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 what they want and lock and we're going to 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.690
 find on the arrival of pivots 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.390
 completely free this is for them 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.710
 7 you put him in install and in 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.690
 confirm 1 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.760
 done this we're going to have some adjustments 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.350
 in the native application the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 configurations of these tweets the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.800
 let's find in settings so 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.750
 for this we are going to go in the part of 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.120
 below and we will find that the thread 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.260
 that 7 here we are going to be able 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.660
 select how many applications 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.880
 we want there to be many accesses 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.220
 direct we can have 5 and we can 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.570
 deactivate the code at the moment of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.450
 enter any of them ok 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.570
 here are other options how to put what 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.110
 which is the camera or remove it and also 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.360

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.300

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.570
 other settings for the tweet 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.930
