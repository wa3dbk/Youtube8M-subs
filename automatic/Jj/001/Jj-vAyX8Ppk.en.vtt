need to remember which aces have turned

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.330 
need to remember which aces have turned
over<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.080> aces<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.830> law

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340

magician<00:02:12.849> Bertrille<00:02:13.660> Hammond<00:02:14.080> introduced

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
magician Bertrille Hammond introduced

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.030 
magician Bertrille Hammond introduced
the<00:02:14.920> idea<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.489> using<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.090> ace23<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.410> four<00:02:17.770> of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the idea of using the ace23 and four of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.140 
the idea of using the ace23 and four of
one<00:02:18.610> suit<00:02:19.030> instead<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:20.080> using<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.560> four<00:02:20.800> aces

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
one suit instead of using the four aces

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.960 
one suit instead of using the four aces
this<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.300> what<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.480> did<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:22.989> performance

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
this is what I did in my performance

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.580 
this is what I did in my performance
because<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.000> cards<00:02:25.510> might<00:02:25.750> turn<00:02:26.080> over<00:02:26.380> in

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
because the cards might turn over in

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.630 
because the cards might turn over in
numerical<00:02:27.250> order

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
numerical order

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880 
numerical order
it<00:02:27.819> might<00:02:28.390> becomes<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.930> no-brainer<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it might becomes a no-brainer for the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.680 
it might becomes a no-brainer for the
spectators<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.819> follow<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.239> trick<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
spectators to follow the trick and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.770 
spectators to follow the trick and
therefore<00:02:32.560> understands<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.550> appreciates<00:02:34.000> it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
therefore understands and appreciates it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.920 
therefore understands and appreciates it
even<00:02:35.290> more<00:02:35.500> I'm<00:02:36.459> not<00:02:36.519> suggesting<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
even more I'm not suggesting you have to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.589 
even more I'm not suggesting you have to
perform<00:02:38.170> twisting<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.099> Aces<00:02:39.519> like<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.030> it's

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
perform twisting the Aces like this it's

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.229 
perform twisting the Aces like this it's
just<00:02:40.930> an<00:02:41.140> example<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:42.670> point<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.209> that

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
just an example my point is that

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.539 
just an example my point is that
whenever<00:02:44.140> possible<00:02:44.560> thinking<00:02:45.340> about

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
whenever possible thinking about

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.970 
whenever possible thinking about
