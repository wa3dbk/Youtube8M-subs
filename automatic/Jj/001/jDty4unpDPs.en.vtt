00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.350
 day without being able to eat meat there goes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.539
 young people not personally he is very 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 fast but to make an indication of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 a grigoletto channel this video will not even go 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 roll so you can use the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.640
 time of you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.400
 watching the video that I'm going to indicate is the rs 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 hfx 10 in play knows how to speak the name of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 it was a video but I did not 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 I know how to talk, I think it's great, it's flex. 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.390
 something like that and he makes gt templates 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 so she says she'll only have a link 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.210
 for a video of the EC and laminated heads and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.940
 you can follow it there the way he 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.200
 made with nuclear bombs was not much 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.559
 he simply modified that bomb 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 that bomb from the hand to the chic face bomb 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.829
 we use our videos 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.899
 chase and he threw a thunderbolt 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.949
 gigantic explosion and made some 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.329
 experiences with the code of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.340
 invincibility and tried to explode 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930
 survive has a pretty cool picture 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.150
 Anyway, I recommend that you give 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.740
 Look at the mold is making several is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 he did think for example is also great 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.840
 he did not have any in the car has a lot 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.320
 cool of this hand and now it was this bomb 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.080
 nuclear 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.790
 and it really is very well so I know 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.650
 that the video short but she just to speak 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.080
 on this mode I did not ask for authorization 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.820
 him to use his image could even 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.830
 give me such that I had released the image 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 for some people but I think the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 fairer it is that we recognize the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.409
 The guy's job then click there I told him 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.909
 that hashtag would blunder in the comments 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 for what the brother knows that people 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.090
 Send me I wanted to thank you all 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.350
 cast a mold to allies in arrears will 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.549
 active-talking tip was vital. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.770
 Nothing to comment in Portuguese 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.869
 laureate is not going to understand 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.939
