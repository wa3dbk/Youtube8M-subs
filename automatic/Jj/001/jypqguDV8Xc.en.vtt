my other scrap of blackberry passport
but<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.590> other<00:01:22.799> new<00:01:23.040> ones<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> felt

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but I do have other new ones but I felt

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.890 
but I do have other new ones but I felt
you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.180> wash<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.750> off

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you know I can just wash this one off

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
you know I can just wash this one off
and<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.290> works<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.220> reason<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> part

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and it works but the reason that part

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.060 
and it works but the reason that part
right<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.630> lifted<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.680> is

right there is lifted a little bit is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410 
right there is lifted a little bit is
because<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.520> where<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> peeled<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> off<00:01:30.150> at

it<00:04:49.199> cost<00:04:49.560> $25.00<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.060> guess<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.449> put<00:04:51.629> a

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
it cost $25.00 and I guess you put a

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.649 
it cost $25.00 and I guess you put a
value<00:04:52.590> on<00:04:52.800> if<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:53.219> think<00:04:53.430> this<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:53.669> worth<00:04:53.849> $25

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
value on if you think this is worth $25
