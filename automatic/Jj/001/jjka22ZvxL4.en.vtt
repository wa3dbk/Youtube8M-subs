hello<00:00:00.299> everyone<00:00:00.780> thanks<00:00:00.810> for<00:00:01.439> checking<00:00:01.589> my

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hello everyone thanks for checking my

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.860 
hello everyone thanks for checking my
project<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.669> drew<00:00:02.850> pneumatics<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.689> the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
project I drew pneumatics going the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.499 
project I drew pneumatics going the
distance<00:00:04.100> I'm<00:00:05.100> here<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.670> tell<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.029> how<00:00:06.270> my

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
distance I'm here to tell you how my

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.669 
distance I'm here to tell you how my
hydropneumatic<00:00:07.020> car<00:00:07.529> works<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> how

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
hydropneumatic car works so this is how

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.490 
hydropneumatic car works so this is how
I<00:00:13.710> Mahajan<00:00:14.280> pneumatic<00:00:14.700> car<00:00:15.059> works<00:00:15.360> first<00:00:16.350> of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I Mahajan pneumatic car works first of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.890 
I Mahajan pneumatic car works first of
all<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> water<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.210> stored<00:00:18.539> inside

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
all all for the water is stored inside

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.750 
all all for the water is stored inside
the<00:00:19.410> water<00:00:19.619> reservoir<00:00:20.960> when<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.109> bring<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
the water reservoir when you bring the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.160 
the water reservoir when you bring the
pressure<00:00:23.760> pump<00:00:24.090> up

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
pressure pump up

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.460 
pressure pump up
it<00:00:25.230> sucks<00:00:26.099> water<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> reservoir<00:00:27.470> into

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it sucks water from the reservoir into

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
it sucks water from the reservoir into
the<00:00:28.650> pump<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.220> then<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.150> push<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.390> down

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the pump and then when you push it down

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.440 
the pump and then when you push it down
it<00:00:31.199> brings<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.890> water<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:33.120> into

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it brings the water down here up into

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
it brings the water down here up into
here<00:00:33.600> strongly<00:00:34.110> psi<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.829> back<00:00:35.520> down<00:00:35.790> here

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
here strongly psi and back down here

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
here strongly psi and back down here
into<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.630> pressure<00:00:37.320> tank<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.190> where<00:00:38.340> all

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
into the pressure tank this is where all

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760 
into the pressure tank this is where all
the<00:00:38.640> power<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> builds<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the power is because it builds up the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.819 
the power is because it builds up the
pressure<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> water<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> air<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
pressure of the water to the air and

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
pressure of the water to the air and
when<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.860> flip<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.520> switch<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> on

when you flip this switch on to the on

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
when you flip this switch on to the on
position<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> water<00:00:48.329> gets

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.860 
trained from here into the motor part
that<00:00:53.250> spins<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.420> bunch<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> gears<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:56.430> down

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.050 

use<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> short<00:01:16.710> clip<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.159> how<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> pump<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
use the short clip on how you pump the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
use the short clip on how you pump the
water<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> reservoir<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
water from the reservoir into the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:02:27.540 
water from the reservoir into the
pressure<00:01:20.040> tank

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.910 

yeah

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
yeah

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.620 
yeah
didn't<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.040> look<00:02:31.070> like<00:02:31.430> fun<00:02:32.000> now<00:02:32.360> once

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
didn't that look like fun now once

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.720 
didn't that look like fun now once
you've<00:02:32.870> done<00:02:33.140> building<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.920> pressure<00:02:34.190> you

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
you've done building up the pressure you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.310 
you've done building up the pressure you
can<00:02:34.880> share<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.540> see<00:02:35.690> how<00:02:35.720> far<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.170> car

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
can share it on and see how far the car

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.790 
can share it on and see how far the car
goes<00:02:39.130> alright<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.580> here's<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.810> hydramat<00:02:42.410> time

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
goes alright so here's the hydramat time

00:02:42.800 --> 00:03:03.770 
goes alright so here's the hydramat time
axis

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.660 

dicks<00:03:04.780> brought<00:03:05.050> in<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.350> video<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:06.070> hope<00:03:06.460> you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
dicks brought in this video I hope you

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.690 
dicks brought in this video I hope you
enjoyed<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.060> project
