00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.660
 good afternoon now i will tell you how 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.050
 make glue from polystyrene and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 solvent acetone plus for that i 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.080
 here's a polystyrene tile 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.930
 would ear grind 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.150
 broke pieces and put it in such 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.910
 I took a bottle of 3 grams 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.929
 polystyrene and 5 milliliters of solvent 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 colors plus polystyrene long 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.270
 so it dissolves around the clock 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.649
 I lay down I mixed it and got 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.840
 Here is such a thick mass 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 it is thick but uniform that is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 polystyrene is completely dissolved in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 solvent acetone plus to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:03.629
 this glue was really useful in it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.770
 it is necessary to add liquid flux 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:13.939
 rosin and which we did past 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:17.009
 experiment and so here is 8 milliliters 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:23.310
 dissolved polystyrene i into it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.909
 add 2 milliliters of liquid flux from 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.909
 rosin 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.510
 after which of course we mix 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.340
 after we have mixed and on 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.740
 stand up our glue is ready 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.010
 rosin greatly enhances adhesion 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.710
 its glue properties are therefore best not 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.320
 use clean polystyrene glue 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:14.340
 and solvent must be added 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:16.550
 rosin somewhere so that's it and glue 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.550
 ready
