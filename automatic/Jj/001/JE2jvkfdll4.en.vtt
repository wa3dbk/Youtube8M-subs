there<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:46.100> more<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.340> press

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
there you can see more so you can press

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.160 
there you can see more so you can press
in<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:48.540> per<00:01:48.780> usual

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
in like per usual

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.149 
in like per usual
you<00:01:49.320> can't<00:01:49.500> pull<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.829> though<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you can't pull them out though which is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
you can't pull them out though which is
awesome<00:01:50.610> yes<00:01:51.240> thank<00:01:52.079> God<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.560> can't

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
awesome yes thank God for that you can't

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
awesome yes thank God for that you can't
pull<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.390> nice<00:01:54.570> they

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
pull them out so that's really nice they

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.620 
pull them out so that's really nice they
got<00:01:54.899> P<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.740> PS<00:01:56.040> button<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> middle<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.540> i

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
got P so PS button in the middle which i

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.580 
got P so PS button in the middle which i
think<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.840> being<00:01:57.930> moved<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> little<00:01:58.439> bit

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
think is being moved down a little bit

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
think is being moved down a little bit
but<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.860> dramatically<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but not dramatically so what is it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.499 
but not dramatically so what is it
little<00:02:00.960> light<00:02:01.110> come<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.939> there<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.060> go

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
little light come on there we go

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.940 
little light come on there we go
so<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.380> also<00:02:04.530> where<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:04.860> your

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
so that's also where you put your

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
so that's also where you put your
headset<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.759> plug<00:02:05.939> into<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.299> icon<00:02:06.600> mono

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
headset you plug into this icon mono

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.219 
headset you plug into this icon mono
headset

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
headset

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.240 
headset
plug<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.099> anyways<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.410> goddess<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
plug it in anyways to go goddess way the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.570 
plug it in anyways to go goddess way the
biggest<00:02:11.459> change<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.090> probably<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.690> touchpad

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
biggest change is probably this touchpad

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500 
biggest change is probably this touchpad
so<00:02:13.940> zoom<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.370> mm-hmm<00:02:16.400> see<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.030> know<00:02:17.150> just

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
so zoom in mm-hmm see you know just

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.370 
so zoom in mm-hmm see you know just
about<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:18.530> touch<00:02:18.740> today<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:20.090> got<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.210> pretty

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
about in touch today it's got a pretty

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.260 
about in touch today it's got a pretty
multi-touch<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.100> actually<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> an

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
multi-touch so it's actually like a an

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.570 
multi-touch so it's actually like a an
iPad<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:23.780> iPhone<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.740> can<00:02:24.920> do<00:02:25.100> multi<00:02:25.370> start

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
iPad or iPhone you can do multi start

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.670 
iPad or iPhone you can do multi start
you<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.790> zoom<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.270> out<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.960> can<00:02:26.990> swing

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
you can zoom in and out you can swing

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.340 
you can zoom in and out you can swing
that<00:02:27.860> way<00:02:28.010> attack<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.810> put<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.960> best<00:02:30.140> way

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
that way attack that put it the best way

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.110 
that way attack that put it the best way
to<00:02:30.380> explain<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.490> probably<00:02:31.820> playing

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
to explain it is probably playing

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.090 
to explain it is probably playing
Killzone<00:02:32.660> or<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.470> use<00:02:33.560> your<00:02:33.650> our<00:02:33.830> to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
Killzone or you can use your our to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.030 
Killzone or you can use your our to
solve<00:02:34.340> flick<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.570> attack<00:02:36.140> certain<00:02:36.650> enemies

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
solve flick and attack certain enemies

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.910 
solve flick and attack certain enemies
which<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.700> quite<00:02:37.880> cool<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.230> d-pad<00:02:39.530> if

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
which is quite cool this is the d-pad if

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.340 
which is quite cool this is the d-pad if
is<00:02:40.130> very<00:02:40.340> similar<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> ps3<00:02:41.090> controller

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
is very similar to the ps3 controller

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.450 
is very similar to the ps3 controller
then<00:02:42.350> their<00:02:42.500> dinner<00:02:42.650> day<00:02:42.830> if<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.160> was<00:02:43.250> very

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
then their dinner day if it was very

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.310 
then their dinner day if it was very
solid<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:44.090> mean<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.540> ps3<00:02:44.840> controller<00:02:44.870> had<00:02:45.290> a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
solid I mean the ps3 controller had a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.340 
solid I mean the ps3 controller had a
very<00:02:45.560> good<00:02:45.680> d-pad<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.600> cargo<00:02:47.600> plane<00:02:47.750> myself<00:02:47.900> is

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
very good d-pad so cargo plane myself is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.620 
very good d-pad so cargo plane myself is
very<00:02:48.560> nice<00:02:48.830> these<00:02:49.520> bonds<00:02:49.760> feel<00:02:50.000> again<00:02:50.390> very

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
very nice these bonds feel again very

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.690 
very nice these bonds feel again very
very<00:02:50.660> similar<00:02:51.290> sort<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.860> PHP<00:02:52.220> controller<00:02:52.490> pay

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
very similar sort of PHP controller pay

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700 
very similar sort of PHP controller pay
for<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.060> bit<00:02:53.150> more<00:02:53.270> solid<00:02:53.680> take<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
for a little bit more solid take a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.870 
for a little bit more solid take a
little<00:02:54.830> bit<00:02:54.920> more<00:02:55.010> press<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.580> just<00:02:55.730> feels<00:02:55.850> a

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
little bit more press it just feels a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.130 
little bit more press it just feels a
little<00:02:55.940> gets<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> little<00:02:56.630> bit<00:02:56.780> more<00:02:56.840> newer<00:02:57.020> I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
little gets a little bit more newer I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140 
little gets a little bit more newer I
guess<00:02:57.350> being<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.220> new<00:02:58.310> controller<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:59.000> been

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
guess being a new controller have been

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.500 
guess being a new controller have been
used<00:02:59.360> yet<00:02:59.570> very<00:03:00.500> nice<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:01.120> didn't<00:03:02.120> miss<00:03:02.420> dinner

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
used yet very nice I didn't miss dinner

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.060 
used yet very nice I didn't miss dinner

and<00:03:04.190> stuff<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.790> can<00:03:04.910> live<00:03:05.150> streams<00:03:05.480> it's<00:03:05.810> got

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
and stuff you can live streams it's got

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.840 
and stuff you can live streams it's got
option<00:03:06.260> bar<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.470> there<00:03:06.650> as<00:03:06.740> well<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.130> see

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
option bar in there as well so see

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.660 
option bar in there as well so see
that's<00:03:07.940> more<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> star<00:03:08.750> bus<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.110> now<00:03:09.200> I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
that's more like a star bus and now I

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.740 
that's more like a star bus and now I
mostly<00:03:10.670> actually<00:03:10.790> use<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.240> shared<00:03:11.450> bus<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.690> be

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
mostly actually use the shared bus to be

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.140 
mostly actually use the shared bus to be
used<00:03:11.900> for<00:03:12.140> Shen<00:03:12.770> screenshots<00:03:13.460> live<00:03:13.820> streams

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
used for Shen screenshots live streams

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.720 
used for Shen screenshots live streams
films<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.230> stuff<00:03:15.350> on<00:03:15.500> Facebook<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:16.580> every

films and stuff on Facebook for every
course<00:03:16.940> let's<00:03:17.120> go<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.420> back<00:03:17.600> of

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
course let's go to the back of

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.880 
course let's go to the back of
controller<00:03:20.170> there<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.260> go<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.590> got<00:03:21.739> new

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
controller there we go so got new

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.699 
controller there we go so got new
triggers<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:23.180> can<00:03:23.330> see<00:03:23.540> there<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.530> there's<00:03:24.650> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
and look sticks fill up better as well

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.160 
and look sticks fill up better as well
in<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.730> triggers<00:04:34.060> that's<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.870> main<00:04:34.990> thing

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
in the triggers that's the main thing

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.010 
in the triggers that's the main thing
for<00:04:35.200> me<00:04:35.850> definitely<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:37.120> big<00:04:37.450> improve<00:04:37.780> on<00:04:37.930> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020
