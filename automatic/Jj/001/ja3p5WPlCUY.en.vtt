that<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.630> transition<00:01:48.630> lenses<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.200> work

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that and transition lenses they work

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.200 
that and transition lenses they work
with<00:01:49.590> any<00:01:49.860> frame<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.030> ask

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
with any frame all you have to do is ask

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
with any frame all you have to do is ask
your<00:01:51.329> eye<00:01:51.390> doctor<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.040> enable<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
your eye doctor if you can enable the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
your eye doctor if you can enable the
transition<00:01:54.090> lenses<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:55.200> glasses<00:01:55.590> in

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
transition lenses on your glasses in

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
transition lenses on your glasses in
your<00:01:55.860> next<00:01:56.070> glasses<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.930> basically

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
your next glasses and it's basically

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.760 
your next glasses and it's basically
just<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.560> film<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.369> existing<00:01:59.460> glasses

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
just a film over your existing glasses

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.889 
just a film over your existing glasses
and<00:02:01.070> that's<00:02:01.729> basically<00:02:01.939> transition<00:02:02.570> London

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
and that's basically transition London

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.539 
and that's basically transition London
but<00:02:03.110> some<00:02:03.530> disadvantages<00:02:04.159> though<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.399> think

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
but some disadvantages though to think

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.749 
but some disadvantages though to think
about<00:02:04.909> when<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.630> watch<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.020> school<00:02:06.369> after<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.579> get

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
about when I watch to school after I get

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.240 
about when I watch to school after I get
docked<00:02:07.939> on<00:02:08.470> when<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.560> entered<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:09.950> school

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.610 
building
people<00:02:11.239> think<00:02:11.480> I'm<00:02:11.569> wearing<00:02:11.720> sunglasses<00:02:12.050> and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
people think I'm wearing sunglasses and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.080 
people think I'm wearing sunglasses and
the<00:02:12.709> teachers<00:02:13.010> they<00:02:13.130> take<00:02:13.400> them<00:02:13.580> off

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the teachers they take them off

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.240 
the teachers they take them off
well<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.140> tell<00:02:15.319> them<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.709> can't<00:02:16.099> take

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
well I have to tell them I can't take

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.699 
well I have to tell them I can't take
the<00:02:16.340> launch<00:02:16.550> because<00:02:17.269> there<00:02:18.080> these<00:02:18.470> are<00:02:18.530> my

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the launch because there these are my

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.900 
the launch because there these are my
glasses<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.250> they're<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.550> turn<00:02:19.760> into

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
glasses and they're just turn into

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.699 
glasses and they're just turn into
sunglasses<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.750> they<00:02:21.080> understand<00:02:21.500> but<00:02:21.650> it

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
sunglasses and they understand but it

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.890 
sunglasses and they understand but it
takes<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.950> while<00:02:21.980> for<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:23.090> for<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> sunglasses

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
takes a while for it for the sunglasses

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.660 
takes a while for it for the sunglasses
to<00:02:24.170> become<00:02:24.410> regular<00:02:24.860> glasses<00:02:25.099> again<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.550> takes

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
to become regular glasses again it takes

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.759 
to become regular glasses again it takes
awhile<00:02:25.910> for<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.150> transitions<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.440> clear

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
awhile for the transitions to go clear

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.190 
awhile for the transitions to go clear
again<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.489> takes<00:02:28.640> around<00:02:28.819> three<00:02:29.690> minutes<00:02:29.870> from

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
again it takes around three minutes from

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.720 
again it takes around three minutes from
when<00:02:30.380> you're<00:02:30.530> inside<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.610> other

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
when you're inside and and other

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.460 
when you're inside and and other
disadvantages<00:02:32.480> if<00:02:32.690> you're<00:02:32.870> driving<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.440> don't

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
disadvantages if you're driving I don't

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.500 
disadvantages if you're driving I don't
drive<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.040> if<00:02:34.130> you're<00:02:34.280> driving<00:02:34.700> your

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
drive it but if you're driving your

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.509 
drive it but if you're driving your
sunglasses<00:02:36.080> or<00:02:36.530> your<00:02:36.709> glasses<00:02:36.920> won't<00:02:37.280> turn

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
sunglasses or your glasses won't turn

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.890 
sunglasses or your glasses won't turn
into<00:02:37.670> sunglasses<00:02:38.209> with<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.450> transition

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
into sunglasses with the transition

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500 
into sunglasses with the transition
lenses<00:02:39.019> because<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.280> glass<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.239> car

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
lenses because the glass on the car

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.559 
lenses because the glass on the car
already<00:02:41.989> blocks<00:02:42.350> those<00:02:42.560> UV<00:02:42.860> rays<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.069> so

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
already blocks those UV rays and so

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.090 
already blocks those UV rays and so
that's<00:02:44.569> not<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.230> perfect<00:02:45.440> solution<00:02:45.769> if<00:02:46.040> you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
that's not the perfect solution if you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.520 
that's not the perfect solution if you
want<00:02:46.489> them<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.850> driving<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.420> other<00:02:48.350> than

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
want them for driving but other than

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.860 
want them for driving but other than
that<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> great<00:02:49.310> pair<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:49.870> transition

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
that it's a great pair of transition

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.289 
that it's a great pair of transition
lens<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.200> healthy<00:02:51.560> sight<00:02:51.799> in<00:02:52.130> every<00:02:52.459> life<00:02:52.670> if

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
lens the healthy sight in every life if

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.610 
lens the healthy sight in every life if
so<00:02:53.480> that's<00:02:53.600> my<00:02:53.810> review<00:02:54.049> of<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.170> transition
