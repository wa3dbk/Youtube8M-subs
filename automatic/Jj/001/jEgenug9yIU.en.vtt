is<00:02:24.459> actually<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:26.019> get<00:02:26.200> increased<00:02:26.650> arm<00:02:27.010> or

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
is actually the you get increased arm or

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.349 
is actually the you get increased arm or
a<00:02:27.670> half<00:02:28.209> now<00:02:29.140> our<00:02:29.470> half<00:02:29.950> delay<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.459> half<00:02:30.970> DK

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
a half now our half delay so half DK

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.199 
a half now our half delay so half DK
basically<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> 50-percent<00:02:33.040> slower<00:02:33.519> drain<00:02:33.970> rate

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
basically a 50-percent slower drain rate

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.000 
basically a 50-percent slower drain rate
of<00:02:34.420> your<00:02:34.630> prayer<00:02:35.049> when<00:02:35.680> you're<00:02:35.829> in<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
of your prayer when you're in the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.150 
of your prayer when you're in the
barrels<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.670> also<00:02:37.120> double<00:02:37.959> rune<00:02:38.170> Lutz<00:02:38.470> so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
barrels and also double rune Lutz so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.830 
barrels and also double rune Lutz so
that's<00:02:39.310> quite<00:02:39.519> nice<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:40.000> screen<00:02:40.299> now<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:40.510> see

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
that's quite nice on screen now we see

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.050 
that's quite nice on screen now we see
these<00:02:41.019> stats<00:02:41.319> from<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.680> mauritania<00:02:42.370> legs<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
these stats from the mauritania legs to

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.979 
these stats from the mauritania legs to
which<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.840> got<00:02:44.019> over<00:02:44.290> from<00:02:44.500> Robin<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.870> was

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
which we got over from Robin and I was

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.520 
which we got over from Robin and I was
actually<00:02:47.170> surprised<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.769> Robin<00:02:48.129> didn't<00:02:48.400> play

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
actually surprised the Robin didn't play

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400 
actually surprised the Robin didn't play
a<00:02:49.560> bigger<00:02:49.830> part<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.700> test<00:02:51.030> system<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.750> I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
a bigger part in this test system I I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.890 
a bigger part in this test system I I
thought<00:02:52.740> he<00:02:52.950> would<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.400> he<00:02:53.550> does<00:02:53.900> forget

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
thought he would because he does forget

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
thought he would because he does forget
exactly<00:02:55.020> what<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.530> game<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.250> he<00:02:56.430> does

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
exactly what the game is but he does

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.570 
exactly what the game is but he does
host<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.209> minigame<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.140> was<00:02:58.319> somewhat<00:02:59.160> surprised

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
host a minigame I was somewhat surprised

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.790 
host a minigame I was somewhat surprised
at<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.120> choices<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.990> Warren<00:03:01.470> weren't

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
at the choices that Warren weren't

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.300 
at the choices that Warren weren't
picked<00:03:02.069> I<00:03:02.280> honestly<00:03:03.120> thought<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:04.310> what

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
picked I honestly thought that the what

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.190 
picked I honestly thought that the what
is<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> forget<00:03:06.090> what's<00:03:06.239> called<00:03:06.510> exactly<00:03:07.020> but

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
is it I forget what's called exactly but

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.949 
is it I forget what's called exactly but
in<00:03:07.290> dark<00:03:07.590> Meyer<00:03:07.860> there's<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.060> new<00:03:09.690> system

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
in dark Meyer there's the new system

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.740 
in dark Meyer there's the new system
where<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.590> unlock<00:03:11.130> additional<00:03:11.790> ranks<00:03:12.600> by

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
where you can unlock additional ranks by

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.620 
where you can unlock additional ranks by
doing<00:03:13.200> favors<00:03:13.650> all<00:03:13.830> about<00:03:14.100> town<00:03:14.540> for<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
doing favors all about town for the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.180 
doing favors all about town for the
different<00:03:15.930> vampires<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.620> thought<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.980> would

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
different vampires I thought that would

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.110 
different vampires I thought that would
play<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> more<00:03:17.760> pivotal<00:03:18.660> role<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:20.120> dire

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
play a more pivotal role and the dire

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.000 
play a more pivotal role and the dire
reason<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.690> did<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:22.050> instead<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:22.800> are<00:03:22.830> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
reason it did not instead there are a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.910 
reason it did not instead there are a
abundant<00:03:25.100> sets<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.430> requirements<00:03:26.610> from<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
abundant sets of requirements from the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.500 
abundant sets of requirements from the
temple<00:03:28.920> tracking<00:03:29.370> which<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.850> pretty<00:03:30.239> old

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
temple tracking which is a pretty old

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.110 
temple tracking which is a pretty old
content<00:03:31.110> it's<00:03:31.470> been<00:03:31.680> updated<00:03:32.010> recently<00:03:32.459> but

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
content it's been updated recently but

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.080 
content it's been updated recently but
still<00:03:33.780> pretty<00:03:33.959> old<00:03:34.230> content<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.030> anyway<00:03:36.030> so

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
still pretty old content but anyway so

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.900 
still pretty old content but anyway so
here<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.050> look<00:03:37.319> of<00:03:37.560> everything<00:03:38.310> are<00:03:38.580> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
here is the look of everything are the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.170 
here is the look of everything are the
stats<00:03:39.180> anyways<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.580> level-3<00:03:41.580> armored<00:03:42.000> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
stats anyways of the level-3 armored and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.840 
stats anyways of the level-3 armored and
we<00:03:43.080> can<00:03:43.260> see<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.620> not<00:03:43.920> too<00:03:44.100> bad<00:03:44.250> i<00:03:44.310> think<00:03:44.700> it's

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
we can see it's not too bad i think it's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.979 
we can see it's not too bad i think it's
equivalent<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.950> dragonhide<00:03:47.600> don't<00:03:48.600> call<00:03:48.810> me

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
equivalent to dragonhide don't call me

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.800 
equivalent to dragonhide don't call me
on<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.290> i<00:03:49.319> can<00:03:49.970> let<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.000> know<00:03:51.150> for<00:03:51.420> sure<00:03:51.569> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
on that i can let you know for sure and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.600 
on that i can let you know for sure and
then<00:03:52.230> immediately<00:03:52.769> after<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.280> we're<00:03:53.489> going

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
then immediately after this we're going

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.600 
then immediately after this we're going
to<00:03:53.760> see<00:03:54.120> uh<00:03:54.630> what<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.590> whole<00:03:55.890> set<00:03:56.160> looks<00:03:56.400> like

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
to see uh what the whole set looks like

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.979 
to see uh what the whole set looks like
so<00:03:56.790> everything<00:03:57.120> I'm<00:03:57.269> wearing<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.660> elite

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
so everything I'm wearing is elite

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.170 
so everything I'm wearing is elite
except<00:03:58.890> for<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.340> legs<00:03:59.610> which<00:03:59.970> are<00:04:00.060> obviously

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
except for the legs which are obviously

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.030 
except for the legs which are obviously
not<00:04:00.480> elite<00:04:00.959> they're<00:04:01.200> just<00:04:01.410> hard<00:04:01.650> at<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
then put the crystal nienke within your

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.930 
then put the crystal nienke within your
steel<00:04:42.900> ring<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:43.860> was<00:04:44.010> kind<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.400> pain<00:04:44.640> and

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
steel ring that was kind of a pain and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.880 
steel ring that was kind of a pain and
there<00:04:45.660> were<00:04:45.750> some<00:04:45.930> other<00:04:46.050> parts<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.620> just

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
there were some other parts of just

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.820 
there were some other parts of just
worth<00:04:47.580> as<00:04:47.820> intuitive<00:04:48.360> like<00:04:48.870> starting<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
worth as intuitive like starting the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.350 
worth as intuitive like starting the
cider<00:04:50.930> brewing<00:04:51.930> ah<00:04:52.760> basically<00:04:53.760> if<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.210> look

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
cider brewing ah basically if you look

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.360 
cider brewing ah basically if you look
at<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.539> wiki<00:04:54.870> page<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.350> tells<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.950> start

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
at the wiki page it tells you to start

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.070 
at the wiki page it tells you to start
with<00:04:56.550> buckets<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:57.060> water<00:04:57.120> but<00:04:57.539> you<00:04:57.720> don't<00:04:57.990> even

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
with buckets of water but you don't even

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.399 
with buckets of water but you don't even
need<00:04:58.380> any<00:04:58.560> buckets<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:59.070> water<00:04:59.099> or<00:04:59.460> barley<00:04:59.849> malt

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
need any buckets of water or barley malt

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.070 
need any buckets of water or barley malt
so<00:05:01.069> there<00:05:01.519> are<00:05:01.639> some<00:05:01.969> tricky<00:05:02.419> parts<00:05:02.719> on<00:05:02.869> there

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080

but<00:05:03.769> there's<00:05:04.039> nothing<00:05:04.339> too<00:05:04.519> terrible<00:05:04.729> if

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
but there's nothing too terrible if
