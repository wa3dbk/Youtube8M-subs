remove the inside bolt just to give us
room<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.940> measure<00:01:16.150> more<00:01:16.420> easily<00:01:16.750> with<00:01:17.260> that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
room to measure more easily with that

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.230 
room to measure more easily with that
bolt<00:01:17.680> out<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.040> way<00:01:18.159> we<00:01:18.370> can<00:01:18.520> measure<00:01:18.700> over

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
bolt out of the way we can measure over

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.980 
bolt out of the way we can measure over
50<00:01:19.750> millimeters<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.790> that'll<00:01:22.390> show<00:01:22.600> us<00:01:22.780> where

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
50 millimeters and that'll show us where

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.600 
50 millimeters and that'll show us where
we're<00:01:23.080> going<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.260> drill<00:01:23.530> our<00:01:23.650> next<00:01:24.010> hole<00:01:29.610> let's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
we're going to drill our next hole let's

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.490 
we're going to drill our next hole let's
go<00:01:30.790> ahead<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.090> remove<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.540> second<00:01:31.960> bolt<00:01:32.200> and
