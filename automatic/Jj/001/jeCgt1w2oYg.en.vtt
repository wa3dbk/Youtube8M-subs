smaller<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.990> 2930<00:01:48.990> milliamp<00:01:49.409> hours<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.280> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
smaller at 2930 milliamp hours you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
smaller at 2930 milliamp hours you can
get<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.240> days<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.930> with

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
get up to two days out of this with

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620 
get up to two days out of this with
stamina<00:01:52.530> mode<00:01:52.829> enabled<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.270> honest<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
stamina mode enabled but to be honest I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.359 
stamina mode enabled but to be honest I
think<00:01:54.840> most<00:01:55.020> people<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.619> still<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.009> charging

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
think most people will still be charging
