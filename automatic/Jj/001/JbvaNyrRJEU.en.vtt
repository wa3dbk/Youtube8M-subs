00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the fact that well um they probably

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
the fact that well um they probably
would<00:01:14.250> find<00:01:14.430> halo<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.060> couple<00:01:15.450> days<00:01:15.570> ago<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
would find halo a couple days ago and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
coming back to this which is completely

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560

not the best gameplay I mean I think I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.010 
not the best gameplay I mean I think I
went<00:01:34.110> 29<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.970> got<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> nice<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.689> streak

the<00:02:01.469> VR<00:02:01.680> ok<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.600> personally<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:03.960> find<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the VR ok so personally I don't find it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.600 
the VR ok so personally I don't find it
to<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.469> too<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:04.860> issue<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
to be too much of an issue but that you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.680 
to be too much of an issue but that you
a<00:02:05.640> lot<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> people<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.360> um<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> BR<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.910> mean<00:02:09.569> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a lot of people do um the BR I mean you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.880 
a lot of people do um the BR I mean you
guys<00:02:09.780> probably<00:02:09.989> know<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.770> what

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
guys probably know what you know what

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.420 
guys probably know what you know what
the<00:02:11.039> difference<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.489> 30

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
the difference is 30

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.770 
the difference is 30
first<00:02:12.689> DMR<00:02:13.689> one<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.129> know<00:02:15.250> one<00:02:15.400> shot

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
first DMR one you know one shot

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.270 
first DMR one you know one shot
personally<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.870> think<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.500> DMR<00:02:17.920> will<00:02:18.099> take<00:02:18.250> a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
personally I think the DMR will take a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.970 
personally I think the DMR will take a
little<00:02:18.400> bit<00:02:18.549> more<00:02:18.730> skill<00:02:19.180> um<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:20.739> are

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
little bit more skill um be are

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.069 
little bit more skill um be are
generally<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.519> mean<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.969> you<00:02:22.120> if<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.569> if<00:02:22.780> if

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
generally I mean if you if you can if if

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.470 
generally I mean if you if you can if if
you<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:23.409> any<00:02:23.650> exposure<00:02:24.129> to<00:02:24.730> FPS<00:02:25.239> is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
you have any exposure to FPS is

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.410 
you have any exposure to FPS is
first-person<00:02:26.079> shooters<00:02:26.409> and<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:27.909> just<00:02:28.060> spray

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
first-person shooters and you just spray

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.459 
first-person shooters and you just spray
towards<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.019> head<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.819> couple<00:02:30.819> times<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:32.079> can

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
towards the head a couple times you can

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.349 
towards the head a couple times you can
get<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> fourth<00:02:32.859> shot<00:02:33.069> pretty<00:02:33.280> easy<00:02:33.609> i<00:02:33.760> mean<00:02:34.060> you

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
get a fourth shot pretty easy i mean you

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.580 
get a fourth shot pretty easy i mean you
know<00:02:34.389> when<00:02:34.569> you're<00:02:34.719> showing<00:02:34.989> someone<00:02:35.200> when

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
know when you're showing someone when

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.929 
know when you're showing someone when
someone<00:02:35.829> has<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.950> good<00:02:36.129> straight<00:02:36.400> going<00:02:36.700> on

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
someone has a good straight going on

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.720 
someone has a good straight going on
kind<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.329> hard<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.709> DMR<00:02:39.189> takes<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.579> whole

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
kind of hard but the DMR takes a whole

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.399 
kind of hard but the DMR takes a whole
new<00:02:39.849> thing<00:02:39.879> to<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.329> first<00:02:40.540> off<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.049> can't<00:02:41.079> just

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
new thing to it first off you can't just

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.530 
new thing to it first off you can't just
spray<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.859> it<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.310> got<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.519> kind<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.969> land

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
spray with it you got to kind of land

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.020 
spray with it you got to kind of land
that<00:02:43.870> one<00:02:44.530> shot<00:02:44.889> that<00:02:45.129> you<00:02:45.220> have<00:02:45.370> over<00:02:45.879> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that one shot that you have over and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.649 
that one shot that you have over and
over<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.299> over<00:02:46.709> about<00:02:47.709> six<00:02:48.069> times<00:02:48.370> i<00:02:48.790> believe

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
over and over about six times i believe

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.569 
over and over about six times i believe
i<00:02:49.689> think<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:49.930> five<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.799> body<00:02:51.040> once<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
i think it's five to the body once the

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.849 
i think it's five to the body once the
head<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.629> mean<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.049> quite<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.290> bit<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.590> not

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
head so I mean it's quite a bit of a not

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.349 
head so I mean it's quite a bit of a not
a<00:02:53.889> challenge<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.579> it's<00:02:54.639> quite<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.909> bit<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.209> a

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
a challenge but it's quite a bit of a

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.140 
a challenge but it's quite a bit of a
you<00:02:56.200> know<00:02:56.319> amount<00:02:57.069> of<00:02:57.159> shots<00:02:57.370> yet<00:02:57.639> to<00:02:57.730> take<00:02:57.909> uh

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
you know amount of shots yet to take uh

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.110 
you know amount of shots yet to take uh
uh<00:02:58.659> and<00:02:58.989> game<00:02:59.349> types<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.739> SWAT<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.400> felt<00:03:01.000> like

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
uh and game types like SWAT it felt like

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.789 
uh and game types like SWAT it felt like
I<00:03:01.150> take<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.359> look<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.930> little<00:03:01.959> bit<00:03:02.200> more<00:03:02.349> skill

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
I take a look a little bit more skill

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.860 
I take a look a little bit more skill
than<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:03.159> VR<00:03:03.459> because<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.269> beer<00:03:04.450> i<00:03:04.480> believe

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
than the VR because the beer i believe

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.869 
than the VR because the beer i believe
if<00:03:05.019> he<00:03:05.169> landed<00:03:05.439> one<00:03:05.680> shot<00:03:05.980> on<00:03:06.219> their<00:03:06.400> head<00:03:06.579> with

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
if he landed one shot on their head with

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.809 
if he landed one shot on their head with
the<00:03:07.000> BR<00:03:07.329> which<00:03:07.659> was<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.560> three<00:03:08.889> round<00:03:09.010> burst<00:03:09.310> gun

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
the BR which was a three round burst gun

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.659 
the BR which was a three round burst gun
it<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.840> know<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.019> got<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.349> kills<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.219> kind

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
it you know you got the kills so I kind

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.300 
it you know you got the kills so I kind
of<00:03:12.790> reduced<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.750> skill<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> little<00:03:14.290> bit<00:03:14.439> while

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
of reduced the skill a little bit while

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.879 
of reduced the skill a little bit while
with<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.639> DMR<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.540> seemed<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.769> was<00:03:17.859> a

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
with the DMR it seemed like it was a

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.759 
with the DMR it seemed like it was a
little<00:03:18.010> bit<00:03:18.159> better<00:03:18.540> suited<00:03:19.540> because<00:03:20.139> it's

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
little bit better suited because it's

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.860 
little bit better suited because it's
single<00:03:21.159> shot<00:03:21.370> first<00:03:21.579> off<00:03:21.879> so<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:22.629> only<00:03:22.720> have

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
single shot first off so you only have

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.140 
single shot first off so you only have
one<00:03:23.019> shot<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.319> get<00:03:23.530> off<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.979> second<00:03:24.819> off<00:03:24.940> as

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
one shot to get off and second off as

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.809 
one shot to get off and second off as
you<00:03:25.299> can<00:03:25.419> see<00:03:25.629> as<00:03:25.720> I'm<00:03:25.840> shooting<00:03:26.109> right<00:03:26.260> now<00:03:26.290> on

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
you can see as I'm shooting right now on

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.580 
you can see as I'm shooting right now on
the<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:28.389> reticule<00:03:28.840> where<00:03:29.290> you're<00:03:29.409> shooting

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
the the reticule where you're shooting

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.429 
the the reticule where you're shooting
at<00:03:29.879> actually<00:03:30.879> spreads<00:03:31.419> a<00:03:31.540> little<00:03:31.750> bit<00:03:31.870> with

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
at actually spreads a little bit with

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.229 
at actually spreads a little bit with
every<00:03:32.739> shop<00:03:32.979> so<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.579> space<00:03:33.819> your<00:03:34.030> child

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
every shop so you have space your child

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.390 
every shop so you have space your child
that<00:03:34.389> shots<00:03:34.689> out<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.900> little<00:03:35.109> bit<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:36.250> can

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
that shots out a little bit and I can

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.740 
that shots out a little bit and I can
get<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.519> little<00:03:36.669> little<00:03:37.180> hard<00:03:37.419> a<00:03:37.659> little

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
get a little little hard a little

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.330 
get a little little hard a little
difficult<00:03:38.319> adds<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.560> nice<00:03:38.650> little<00:03:38.829> difficulty

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
difficult adds a nice little difficulty

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.360 
difficult adds a nice little difficulty
level<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:40.139> unlike<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.290> BR<00:03:41.590> where<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:42.069> stood

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
level to it unlike the BR where it stood

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.390 
level to it unlike the BR where it stood
the<00:03:42.489> same<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.819> whole<00:03:42.909> time<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.979> I<00:03:44.979> kind<00:03:45.370> of

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
the same the whole time and I kind of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.089 
the same the whole time and I kind of
like<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.759> um<00:03:46.680> also<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.549> DMR<00:03:49.030> i<00:03:49.979> think<00:03:50.979> has

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
like that um also the DMR i think has

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.789 
like that um also the DMR i think has
less<00:03:51.370> rounds<00:03:52.169> which<00:03:53.169> is<00:03:53.290> also<00:03:53.530> another<00:03:53.680> thing

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
less rounds which is also another thing

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.219 
less rounds which is also another thing
that<00:03:54.129> it<00:03:54.220> has<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:55.120> adds<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.870> little<00:03:55.930> bit<00:03:56.049> more

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
that it has that adds a little bit more

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.860 
that it has that adds a little bit more
skill<00:03:56.560> dewitt<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.009> some<00:03:57.250> extent<00:03:57.609> otherwise<00:03:58.569> i

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
skill dewitt to some extent otherwise i

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.360 
skill dewitt to some extent otherwise i
mean<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.319> pretty<00:03:59.439> much<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.620> same<00:03:59.889> weapon

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
mean it's pretty much the same weapon

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.319 
mean it's pretty much the same weapon
just<00:04:00.909> not<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.569> know<00:04:01.599> three<00:04:01.900> round<00:04:02.109> burst<00:04:02.290> and

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
just not you know three round burst and

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.149 
just not you know three round burst and
it<00:04:04.329> has<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.810> uh<00:04:04.840> spread<00:04:05.349> but<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.799> know<00:04:05.889> as

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
it has that uh spread but you know as

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.309 
it has that uh spread but you know as
far<00:04:06.370> as<00:04:06.519> SWAT<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.569> is<00:04:07.720> ridiculous<00:04:08.199> I

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
far as SWAT and this is ridiculous I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.179 
far as SWAT and this is ridiculous I
don't<00:04:08.439> know<00:04:08.500> if<00:04:08.590> there's<00:04:08.799> what<00:04:08.949> a<00:04:08.979> counter

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
don't know if there's what a counter

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.149 
don't know if there's what a counter
that<00:04:09.459> this<00:04:09.699> guy<00:04:09.849> came<00:04:10.030> up<00:04:10.150> behind<00:04:10.239> me<00:04:10.479> and<00:04:10.540> just

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
that this guy came up behind me and just

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.229 
that this guy came up behind me and just
assassinated<00:04:12.159> me<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.579> mean<00:04:12.790> either<00:04:12.909> way<00:04:13.030> he

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
assassinated me I mean either way he

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.339 
assassinated me I mean either way he
could<00:04:13.359> have<00:04:13.389> shot<00:04:13.599> me<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> head<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.229> what

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
could have shot me in the head and what

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.199 
could have shot me in the head and what
it<00:04:14.439> died<00:04:14.590> either<00:04:14.739> way<00:04:14.979> but<00:04:15.639> I<00:04:15.699> thought<00:04:15.939> maybe

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
it died either way but I thought maybe

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:16.949 
it died either way but I thought maybe
because<00:04:16.479> they<00:04:16.570> weren't<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.810> like<00:04:16.930> a

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
because they weren't it's like a

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.589 
because they weren't it's like a
QuickTime<00:04:17.409> thing<00:04:17.709> like<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.070> went<00:04:18.220> like<00:04:18.599> where

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
QuickTime thing like it went like where

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.050 
QuickTime thing like it went like where
it<00:04:19.750> showed<00:04:19.989> him<00:04:20.320> assassinating<00:04:21.159> me<00:04:21.279> I<00:04:21.459> thought

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
it showed him assassinating me I thought

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.159 
it showed him assassinating me I thought
that<00:04:22.120> meant<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.659> could<00:04:22.690> do<00:04:22.930> something

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
that meant that I could do something

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.170 
that meant that I could do something
sounds<00:04:23.469> like<00:04:23.560> jam<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:23.950> every<00:04:24.099> button<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.460> could

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
sounds like jam and every button I could

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.659 
sounds like jam and every button I could
every<00:04:25.900> little<00:04:26.199> button<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.650> could<00:04:26.800> press<00:04:27.039> right

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
every little button I could press right

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.689 
every little button I could press right
there<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.210> nothing<00:04:28.660> happens<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.639> kind<00:04:30.639> of

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
there and nothing happens so kind of

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.050 
there and nothing happens so kind of
just<00:04:30.850> went<00:04:30.970> with<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.180> um<00:04:32.490> was<00:04:33.490> i<00:04:33.610> saying<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
just went with it um was i saying the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.870 
just went with it um was i saying the
halo<00:04:34.660> new<00:04:35.139> halo<00:04:35.500> engine<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.100> don't<00:04:36.669> think<00:04:36.699> it's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
halo new halo engine I don't think it's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.460 
halo new halo engine I don't think it's
a<00:04:36.940> new<00:04:37.060> engine<00:04:37.270> but<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.750> way<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.259> game<00:04:38.289> plays

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
a new engine but the way the game plays

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.240 
a new engine but the way the game plays
I<00:04:39.190> mean<00:04:39.870> personally<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.900> think<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.139> makes<00:04:41.680> SWAT

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
I mean personally I think it makes SWAT

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.070 
I mean personally I think it makes SWAT
like<00:04:42.490> 10<00:04:42.699> times<00:04:42.940> more<00:04:43.090> difficult<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.810> remember

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080

awesome<00:05:09.460> for<00:05:09.820> competitive<00:05:10.419> gaming<00:05:10.599> when<00:05:10.810> it

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
awesome for competitive gaming when it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.680 
awesome for competitive gaming when it
comes<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.169> MLG<00:05:11.490> because<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.910> seems<00:05:13.150> 20<00:05:13.509> times

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
comes to MLG because it seems 20 times

comes to MLG because it seems 20 times
more<00:05:13.900> difficult<00:05:14.080> than<00:05:14.830> before<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:15.460> certain

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
more difficult than before in certain

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.879

all the specialties like armor lock
jetpack<00:05:21.970> on<00:05:22.300> things<00:05:22.690> like<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:22.990> which<00:05:23.259> I<00:05:23.410> know

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
jetpack on things like that which I know

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.860 
jetpack on things like that which I know
can<00:05:23.710> be<00:05:23.740> limited<00:05:24.190> in<00:05:24.280> forge<00:05:24.699> and<00:05:24.970> in<00:05:25.479> custom

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
can be limited in forge and in custom

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.279 
can be limited in forge and in custom
games<00:05:26.139> um<00:05:26.849> he'll<00:05:27.849> reduce<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.479> difficulty

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
games um he'll reduce the difficulty

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.050 
games um he'll reduce the difficulty
quite<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.560> bit<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.430> I<00:05:30.460> think<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.699> they<00:05:30.849> did<00:05:31.030> a

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
quite a bit so I think that they did a

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.399 
quite a bit so I think that they did a
really<00:05:31.120> good<00:05:31.479> bouncing<00:05:31.960> in<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.110> sense<00:05:32.320> that

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
really good bouncing in the sense that

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.550 
really good bouncing in the sense that
it<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:32.770> very<00:05:33.039> difficult<00:05:33.280> in<00:05:33.849> done<00:05:34.330> play<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.409> um

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
it is very difficult in done play but um

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.560 
it is very difficult in done play but um
it's<00:05:36.250> really<00:05:36.340> easy<00:05:36.639> to<00:05:36.789> defend<00:05:37.090> yourself<00:05:37.510> from

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
it's really easy to defend yourself from

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.510 
it's really easy to defend yourself from
guns<00:05:37.900> but<00:05:38.260> after<00:05:38.979> you're<00:05:39.070> done<00:05:39.159> to<00:05:39.310> found

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
guns but after you're done to found

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.219 
guns but after you're done to found
defending<00:05:40.150> yourself<00:05:40.539> what<00:05:40.690> really<00:05:40.900> matters

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
defending yourself what really matters

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.960 
defending yourself what really matters
is<00:05:41.470> can<00:05:41.620> you<00:05:41.710> get<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.919> kills<00:05:42.190> done<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.760> got<00:05:42.880> to

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
is can you get the kills done you got to

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.029 
is can you get the kills done you got to
get<00:05:43.090> those<00:05:43.180> kills<00:05:43.479> down<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:43.990> most<00:05:44.680> people

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
get those kills down and most people

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.740 
get those kills down and most people
can't<00:05:45.340> get<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.669> kills<00:05:45.880> down<00:05:46.090> which<00:05:46.360> makes<00:05:46.599> you

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
can't get the kills down which makes you

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.930 
can't get the kills down which makes you
know<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:46.900> little<00:05:47.260> bit<00:05:47.380> easier<00:05:47.800> for<00:05:48.039> you<00:05:48.190> I<00:05:48.400> do

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
know a little bit easier for you I do

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.890 
know a little bit easier for you I do
see<00:05:49.180> people<00:05:49.389> running<00:05:49.419> around<00:05:49.630> with<00:05:49.840> the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
see people running around with the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.320 
see people running around with the

killing<00:05:52.780> me<00:05:52.870> just<00:05:53.110> because<00:05:53.229> a<00:05:53.320> simple<00:05:53.710> fact

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
killing me just because a simple fact

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.680

that<00:05:54.009> they<00:05:54.669> have<00:05:54.759> that<00:05:54.820> thing<00:05:55.300> where<00:05:55.479> they<00:05:55.570> can

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
that they have that thing where they can

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.149 
that they have that thing where they can
just<00:05:55.840> fly<00:05:56.050> up<00:05:56.080> near<00:05:56.470> whenever<00:05:56.770> they<00:05:56.889> want<00:05:57.099> to

which<00:05:57.520> is<00:05:57.669> kind<00:05:57.849> of<00:05:57.909> annoying<00:05:58.650> like<00:05:59.650> I<00:05:59.740> said

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
which is kind of annoying like I said

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.710 
which is kind of annoying like I said
for<00:05:59.979> MLG<00:06:00.430> there's<00:06:00.820> going<00:06:01.030> to<00:06:01.090> turn<00:06:01.240> it<00:06:01.389> off<00:06:01.479> in

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
for MLG there's going to turn it off in

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.050 
for MLG there's going to turn it off in
custom<00:06:02.289> games<00:06:02.470> probably<00:06:02.740> they<00:06:03.550> may<00:06:03.669> add<00:06:03.789> a<00:06:03.820> few

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
custom games probably they may add a few

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.430 
custom games probably they may add a few
they<00:06:04.300> may<00:06:04.419> allow<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:04.930> use<00:06:05.050> like<00:06:05.259> for
