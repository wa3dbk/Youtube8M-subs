00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.860
 in this presentation we are going to make a 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.280
 practical exercise of application of the 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.400
 concepts seen in the presentation or 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.330
 session of the metallic link I propose 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.490
 the next exercise 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.980
 explain which of the following 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 substances present metallic bond the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.529
 substances are helium magnesium bromine 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.699
 sodium potassium bromide aluminum oxide 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.160
 copper 2 sodium chloride mercury 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.290
 silver and water 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 what strategy are we going to follow to be able to 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.390
 respond to this exercise or respond to 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 This question I propose in the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.400
 next strategy review the concept 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.129
 of the metal link for which there is 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.680
 know that a metal link is 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.780
 formed by groups of atoms of 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.440
 metallic elements that form a network 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.940
 crystalline with metal cores 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.199
 packed in a compact way and the sea 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.540
 of voters as we have seen in the 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.170
 session of the metal link to your 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:11.090
 around if that 's the way the question 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.830
 would look for which of the proposals of 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.070
 substances that we had in the exercise 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.440
 raised would be distributed 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.000
 in is in the periodic system and 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.130
 someone as we see here he 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.440
 would find located in what is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 marked in yellow corresponding to 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.870
 that the elements have is over 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.130
 newspaper have metallic character 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.480
 let's go ahead and do the exercise 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.270
 and respond 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.270
 To the question 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.710
 views the groupings of elements 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.010
 metallic we have in response that the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.430
 unique 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.640
 compounds or species that in this case 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.790
 they recognize metallic are magnesium 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.710
 sodium aluminum mercury and 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.560
 silver since the other substances 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.590
 that we had presented would present 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 different combinations of groupings of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.410
 metal and non-metal groupings 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.690
 metallic elements elements no 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.390
 metallic to each other and therefore the only 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.160
 valid answer would be one in which 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.950
 the compounds or species had 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.380
 clusters of metallic elements 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.470
 sure that most of you have succeeded if 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.000
 that's how I congratulate you and if not 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.090
 it is so I encourage you to review the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.020
 concept of the metallic bond seen in the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.980
 previous session 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.610
 see you at a next meeting in 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.610
 a next session
