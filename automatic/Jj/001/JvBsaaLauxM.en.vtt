so<00:00:39.180> how<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> works<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.770> on

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so how this works is as you can see on

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
so how this works is as you can see on
the<00:00:41.250> outer<00:00:41.430> circle<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.360> twelve<00:00:42.750> bars

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the outer circle there are twelve bars

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.250 
the outer circle there are twelve bars
and<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.920> bar<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> flashing<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.079> hour

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and the bar that is flashing is the hour

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
and the bar that is flashing is the hour
so<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.280> seven<00:00:48.239> o'clock<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so right now this is seven o'clock and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
so right now this is seven o'clock and
as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> seventh<00:00:49.920> bar<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
as you can see the seventh bar is
flashing<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.930> 7<00:00:52.620> o'clock<00:00:52.710> right

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
flashing so this is at 7 o'clock right

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
flashing so this is at 7 o'clock right
now<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> center<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> number<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.230> 51

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
now and in the center the number is 51

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.450 
now and in the center the number is 51
so<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.989> 751<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.469> after<00:00:58.829> using<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.280> a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
noticed is that since the LED shines
through<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> wood<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.820> outside<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
through the wood if you go outside to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.080 
through the wood if you go outside to
direct<00:01:39.930> sunlight<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.100> bright<00:01:41.340> lighting

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
direct sunlight or in a bright lighting

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
direct sunlight or in a bright lighting
condition<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.590> difficult<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
condition it's a little bit difficult to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
condition it's a little bit difficult to
look<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> LED<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> doesn't<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.960> really

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
look at the LED it doesn't get really

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.530 
look at the LED it doesn't get really
bright<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.009> sometimes<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.329> your

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bright so sometimes you have to use your

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.350 
bright so sometimes you have to use your
hand<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.079> block<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> light<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.579> enhance<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
hand to block the light to enhance the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
hand to block the light to enhance the
brightness<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> watch<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> LED<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
brightness of the watch of the LED it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.609 
brightness of the watch of the LED it's
not<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> huge<00:01:54.299> downside<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.409> something

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
not a huge downside but just something

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
not a huge downside but just something
that<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> might<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> also
