you<00:01:36.240> created<00:01:36.750> something<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.380> instead<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
you created something right instead of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.249 
you created something right instead of
buying<00:01:38.400> from<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> third<00:01:39.329> party<00:01:39.840> who<00:01:39.869> just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and they make the actual hardware

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.480 
and they make the actual hardware
opposed<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.350> windows<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.340> make

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
opposed to windows will actually make

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
opposed to windows will actually make
the<00:01:59.759> software<00:02:00.689> but<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.530> control<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the software but they don't control the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.370 
the software but they don't control the
hardware<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.930> doesn't<00:02:04.079> really

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
hardware so actually it doesn't really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.889 
hardware so actually it doesn't really
doesn't<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.399> go<00:02:05.670> together<00:02:05.850> sometimes<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
doesn't really go together sometimes I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.410 
doesn't really go together sometimes I
mean<00:02:07.229> because

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
mean because

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.300 
mean because
unless<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> last<00:02:10.260> one<00:02:10.440> company's<00:02:10.800> doing<00:02:10.950> both

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
unless the last one company's doing both

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
unless the last one company's doing both
you're<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.240> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.570> get<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.930> the
