00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
pictures of it which is probably a good

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
pictures of it which is probably a good
idea<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.070> since<00:01:20.759> there's<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.030> much<00:01:21.210> on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390

YouTube<00:01:21.720> about<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> thought<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.700 
YouTube about it I thought to take a
video<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.340> post<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.560> you're

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
video and post it so if you're

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.719 
video and post it so if you're
interested<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.100> kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.340> kid<00:01:26.549> you'll

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
interested in this kind of kid you'll

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
interested in this kind of kid you'll
have<00:01:26.850> some<00:01:27.030> idea<00:01:27.390> maybe<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.290> goes<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
have some idea maybe what goes into it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.649 
have some idea maybe what goes into it
it<00:01:29.310> took<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> long<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:30.119> together<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it took a long time to put together I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.010 
it took a long time to put together I
was<00:01:31.140> trying<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> nice<00:01:31.799> job<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.869> came

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
was trying to do a nice job and it came

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.630 
was trying to do a nice job and it came
out<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.890> good<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.130> i<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.400> liked

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
out not as good as i would have liked

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.810 
out not as good as i would have liked
it's<00:01:35.880> still<00:01:36.030> pretty<00:01:36.270> nice<00:01:36.540> i<00:01:37.579> think<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> whole

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it's still pretty nice i think the whole

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's still pretty nice i think the whole
thing<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.060> probably<00:01:39.360> pretty<00:01:39.630> fragile<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
thing is probably pretty fragile so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.340 
thing is probably pretty fragile so
don't<00:01:41.700> expect<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.450> any<00:01:42.630> crashed<00:01:43.079> or

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
don't expect it to have any crashed or

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
don't expect it to have any crashed or
volubility<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> i'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> be

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
volubility at all so i'm going to be

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.370 
volubility at all so i'm going to be
very<00:01:46.170> careful<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> anyway

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
very careful with it anyway

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.719 
very careful with it anyway
it's<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:51.880> set<00:01:52.329> up<00:01:52.859> it's<00:01:53.859> got<00:01:54.069> an<00:01:54.460> AR

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
it's a it's all set up it's got an AR

battery and some mini servos and stuff I

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.080 
battery and some mini servos and stuff I
show<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.469> inside<00:02:08.580> there's<00:02:09.580> not<00:02:09.729> much<00:02:09.910> to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
show you the inside there's not much to

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.199 
show you the inside there's not much to
see<00:02:10.269> in<00:02:10.299> there<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:12.129> all<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.489> stuff<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.819> routed

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
see in there of all the stuff is routed

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.820 
see in there of all the stuff is routed
under<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.510> wing<00:02:13.720> because<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.379> battery<00:02:14.739> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
under the wing because the battery is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.660 
under the wing because the battery is
actually<00:02:15.160> under<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.459> wing<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:17.280> had<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.400> cut<00:02:18.640> out

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
actually under the wing I had to cut out

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.180 
actually under the wing I had to cut out
a<00:02:18.819> separate<00:02:19.269> compartment<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.769> bottom<00:02:21.099> of

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
a separate compartment on the bottom of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.009 
a separate compartment on the bottom of
the<00:02:21.250> wing<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.910> under<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> wing<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.840> cut<00:02:22.989> a

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
the wing to under the wing to cut a

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.780 
the wing to under the wing to cut a
chunk<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.500> fuselage<00:02:23.890> out<00:02:24.129> make<00:02:24.280> another<00:02:24.549> hatch

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
chunk of fuselage out make another hatch

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.699 
chunk of fuselage out make another hatch
for<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> battery<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.290> only<00:02:26.470> way<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
for the battery as the only way the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:27.960 
for the battery as the only way the
center<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:26.980> gravity<00:02:27.370> was<00:02:27.459> going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.730> able

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
center of gravity was going to be able

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.170 
center of gravity was going to be able
to<00:02:28.030> post<00:02:28.680> any<00:02:29.680> way<00:02:29.799> I<00:02:29.829> could<00:02:29.950> see<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.280> i<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.519> run

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
to post any way I could see if i can run

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.680 
to post any way I could see if i can run
motors<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:33.400> give<00:02:33.610> me<00:02:33.790> for<00:02:33.970> shaking<00:02:34.209> around<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
motors but give me for shaking around a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
motors but give me for shaking around a
little<00:02:34.810> bit<00:02:40.980> these<00:02:41.980> motors

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.309 

it's<00:02:48.280> going<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.520> have<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.990> crazy<00:02:49.990> amount<00:02:50.440> of

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
it's going to have a crazy amount of

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.450 
it's going to have a crazy amount of
the<00:02:51.859> rust

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
the rust

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.370 
the rust
it<00:02:54.210> feels<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:54.780> going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.990> fly<00:02:55.140> right

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it feels like it's going to fly right

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.250 
it feels like it's going to fly right
out<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.590> my<00:02:55.740> hand

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
out of my hand

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.369 
out of my hand
just<00:02:58.569> messing<00:02:59.569> around<00:02:59.629> on<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.930> ground<00:03:00.170> with

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
just messing around on the ground with

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.949 
just messing around on the ground with
it

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.119 

anyway<00:03:05.959> that's<00:03:06.019> about<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.349> fourth<00:03:06.680> throttle

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
anyway that's about a fourth throttle

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.129 
anyway that's about a fourth throttle
and<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.459> can't<00:03:07.730> really<00:03:07.819> hold<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.510> any

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
and I can't really hold on to it any

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.319 
and I can't really hold on to it any
better<00:03:09.319> than<00:03:09.499> that<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:09.799> I'm<00:03:09.889> not<00:03:10.010> going<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.329> run

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
better than that so I'm not going to run

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.300 
better than that so I'm not going to run
it<00:03:11.450> up<00:03:11.540> any<00:03:11.719> higher<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.349> anyway<00:03:12.620> whole<00:03:13.099> thing

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
it up any higher but anyway whole thing

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.489 
it up any higher but anyway whole thing
comes<00:03:13.489> off<00:03:13.639> looking<00:03:13.790> pretty<00:03:14.120> good<00:03:14.499> nice

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:15.499 
comes off looking pretty good nice

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.309 
comes off looking pretty good nice
enough<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:16.269> impress<00:03:17.269> at<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.629> flying<00:03:17.840> field<00:03:18.109> I

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
enough to impress at the flying field I

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.709 
enough to impress at the flying field I
think<00:03:18.560> especially<00:03:19.219> for<00:03:19.609> an<00:03:19.670> electric<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.389> at

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:20.719 
think especially for an electric and at

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.379 
think especially for an electric and at
the<00:03:20.870> park<00:03:21.139> and<00:03:21.969> looking<00:03:22.969> forward<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.299> giving

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
the park and looking forward to giving

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.030 
the park and looking forward to giving
it<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.629> try<00:03:24.459> yeah<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:25.760> there<00:03:25.909> you<00:03:26.000> go
