00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
in India the US or London the way why we

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
in India the US or London the way why we
listed<00:01:48.690> in<00:01:48.780> London<00:01:49.080> was<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.470> never<00:01:49.830> revenues

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
listed in London was that never revenues

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.890 
listed in London was that never revenues
were<00:01:50.640> 90<00:01:50.909> percent<00:01:51.180> international<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.750> 10

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
were 90 percent international and 10

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.980 
were 90 percent international and 10
percent<00:01:52.049> India<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:53.250> 2002<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.510> government<00:01:54.870> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
percent India in 2002 the government of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.740 
percent India in 2002 the government of
India<00:01:55.350> gave<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:56.610> industry<00:01:57.090> status<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.630> the

film industry

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.950 
film industry
hence<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.700> thought<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.690> time

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
hence that we thought now it's the time

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480 
hence that we thought now it's the time
why<00:02:01.260> don't<00:02:01.440> we<00:02:01.470> consolidated<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.250> into

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
why don't we consolidated back into

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.990 
why don't we consolidated back into
India

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
India

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180 
India
hence<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.810> came<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.170> London<00:02:04.409> market<00:02:04.560> we

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
hence we came to the London market we

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.500 
hence we came to the London market we
caught<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.520> visibility<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.270> caught<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
caught the visibility we caught the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.619 
caught the visibility we caught the
currency<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.740> went<00:02:08.159> back<00:02:08.399> into<00:02:08.610> India<00:02:09.030> simple

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
currency we went back into India simple

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.080 
currency we went back into India simple
