00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.599
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.130
 fifth part of the 100 simmer and yes me 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.869
 I've already had it on Monday and yesterday 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.700
 already announced in a video 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.990
 that is going to be a performance today 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.029
 so now sometimes even two 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.630
 hours before the start of the livestreams and 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.730
 Although complete 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.790
 July at 18 o'clock and the live stream 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.559
 starts at 8 pm on Friday the 23 5 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.739
 So if you have the video on friday 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:43.089
 see today if it is the 23 15 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.040
 2014 by the way yes and yes as I said quite 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.450
 short notice i hope many of you 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.129
 you are there, I will try too 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.719
 So at first I will probably 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.370
 nothing on the chat can go because 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.750
 I think with national pixeln 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.520
 States he came to the week now 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.110
 actually not pixel man 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.329
 go back soon or 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.670
 It will be over soon, but me 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.859
 think now a fast pixeln 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.879
 so it will be streamed then it will open 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.100
 every case is not just minecraft 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.830
 Streamed something in any case 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.710
 it is not determined google this 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.210
 Just let me tell you that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.039
 show logo or maybe now 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 video times or maybe have 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.659
 I already have no idea on the picture 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.830
 every case is the Reichstag 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.140
 actually a really awesome game 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.400
 makes totally bock what I possibly too 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.990
 gamble because he will stream live 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.610
 By the way, so I try it already 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.140
 He will do it for six hours 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.490
 It is not twelve hours or 24 hours 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.920
 For me, I already said because 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.630
 I just do not my school time 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.390
 wants to break rhythm and so does 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.560
 if the weekend is so six 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.820
 hours I think so until 2 o'clock 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.630
 maybe he will go 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.619
 no idea something like that and yes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.720
 where else was I? 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.610
 exactly what else is being played so isec 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.250
 minecraft of course a bit 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.320
 maybe later open pvp towards the end 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.090
 I have to look and what I have to look 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.469
 maybe also thought about somehow 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.060
 just a pokémon edition 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.979
 start and somehow try through 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.210
 to wash or both would then 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.250
 probably go for a few hours 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.019
 so just play a bit 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.519
 or no idea maybe the 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.530
 dolls and then subscribers stay 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.480
 because many also like pokémon I have to 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.709
 but I look almost have 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.170
 I do not plan anything at all 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.000
 spontaneously simply so what attracted it 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.440
 not only my club gambled it will be you 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.570
 not synonymous predominantly something else 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 gambled because I just in minecraft no 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.139
 i do not like to know server 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.850
 and there's something going on because most of them 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.650
 then 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.170
 somehow be after and through the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.550
 Anteroom then follow me and so yes 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.260
 That's why you have to look, yes 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.790
 play ideas write what I am 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 so can still play in the livestream 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.190
 Maybe something was not then 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.260
 so pay attention to the fast and 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.420
 otherwise bewitched or so-called we have to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.730
 that time so people I hope you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.580

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.320

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.560
