at<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> multi<00:00:21.900> floor<00:00:22.230> piston<00:00:22.680> elevator<00:00:23.039> it's

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
at a multi floor piston elevator it's

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
at a multi floor piston elevator it's
nice<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> compact<00:00:24.210> fast<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.410> easy<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> build

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
nice and compact fast and easy to build

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.150 
nice and compact fast and easy to build
so<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:26.970> take<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.330> closer<00:00:27.539> look<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.099> now<00:00:29.099> to

so let's take a closer look at it now to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
so let's take a closer look at it now to
use<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.179> incredibly

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
use this thing is incredibly

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.049 
use this thing is incredibly
self-explanatory<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.980> front<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.910> can

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
self-explanatory in front of you you can

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
self-explanatory in front of you you can
see<00:00:33.210> our<00:00:33.360> floor<00:00:33.630> selector<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.530> build<00:00:34.770> I'm

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
see our floor selector this build I'm

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
see our floor selector this build I'm
showcasing<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.030> video<00:00:36.270> only<00:00:36.750> has<00:00:37.110> five

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
showcasing in this video only has five

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
showcasing in this video only has five
floors<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.670> room<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.149> eight<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
floors but you do have room for eight so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.670 
floors but you do have room for eight so
that's<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.020> something<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> keep<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.590> your

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's just something to keep in your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.090 
that's just something to keep in your
mind

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
mind

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
mind
but<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.760> test<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> be

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
but for this test we're going to be

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.299 
but for this test we're going to be
going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> floor<00:00:43.170> number<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> can

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
going to floor number one and as you can

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
going to floor number one and as you can
see<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.820> selected<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
see that is selected because the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
see that is selected because the
redstone<00:00:46.379> torch<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.800> pointing<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
redstone torch is pointing at it so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
redstone torch is pointing at it so
we'll<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.149> head<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> our<00:00:48.960> elevator<00:00:49.410> now

nice<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.439> fast<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.520> travel<00:01:14.820> around

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
nice and fast I think we travel around
about<00:01:15.299> 10<00:01:15.659> meters<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> second<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.740> fairly

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
about 10 meters a second which is fairly

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
about 10 meters a second which is fairly
impressive<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.880> anyway<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:19.020> at

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
impressive but anyway now that we're at

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.359 
impressive but anyway now that we're at
the<00:01:19.200> top<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.619> pick<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.100> boats<00:01:20.280> and

right as rain as far as the Redstone is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
right as rain as far as the Redstone is
concerned<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:31.079> too<00:01:31.290> bad<00:01:31.530> most<00:01:31.890> of

the wiring goes on at the bottom and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.020 
the wiring goes on at the bottom and
then<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> rest<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.460> easy<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
then all the rest is just a very easy to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
then all the rest is just a very easy to
follow<00:01:36.180> pattern<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.530> were<00:01:37.770> planning

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
follow pattern so if you were planning

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.890 
follow pattern so if you were planning
on<00:01:38.250> building<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.479> shouldn't<00:01:39.780> get

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
on building this then you shouldn't get

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
on building this then you shouldn't get
too<00:01:40.110> lost<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:40.619> quickly<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
too lost very quickly now I'm going to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
too lost very quickly now I'm going to
try<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.329> best<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.750> explain<00:01:43.079> each

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
try and do my best to explain each

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
try and do my best to explain each
element<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.939> detail<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
element in a little bit of detail just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
element in a little bit of detail just
so<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.840> understand<00:01:46.200> what's<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.619> on

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
so you can understand what's going on

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
so you can understand what's going on
and<00:01:46.890> how<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.240> constructing

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and how you would go about constructing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.499 
and how you would go about constructing
one<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.259> yourself<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:51.240> start

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
one of these yourself so let's start

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.359 
one of these yourself so let's start
things<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> elevator<00:01:52.680> itself<00:01:53.130> like

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
things off with the elevator itself like

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
things off with the elevator itself like
I<00:01:53.520> said<00:01:53.759> earlier<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> repeating<00:01:54.899> pattern

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I said earlier it is a repeating pattern

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.649 
I said earlier it is a repeating pattern
and<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> design<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:57.030> very<00:01:57.329> much

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and actually the design is very much

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
and actually the design is very much
unmodified<00:01:58.560> from<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.490> uploaded<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.180> my

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560

down<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> description<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.610> also<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.819 
down in the description and also on the
screen<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.320> check<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.680> for

screen so that you can check that for
yourself<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.940> say<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.509> very

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
yourself but like I say it is a very

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
yourself but like I say it is a very
simple<00:02:10.170> design<00:02:10.500> indeed<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.489> straight

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
simple design indeed it's just straight

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.660 
simple design indeed it's just straight
upwards<00:02:12.239> there's<00:02:12.480> no<00:02:12.629> bells<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.050> whistles<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
upwards there's no bells and whistles it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.309 
upwards there's no bells and whistles it
go<00:02:13.910> down<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.330> there<00:02:14.720> certainly<00:02:14.959> isn't

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
go down and there certainly isn't

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.410 
go down and there certainly isn't
multifloor<00:02:15.920> functionality<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.120> would

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
multifloor functionality but I would

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.030 
multifloor functionality but I would
suggest<00:02:17.630> checking<00:02:17.870> out<00:02:18.200> if<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.739> do<00:02:18.860> want<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
suggest checking out if you do want to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.650 
suggest checking out if you do want to
get<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.220> rough<00:02:19.489> idea<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.880> what<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.270> happening

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
get a rough idea of what is happening

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.050 
get a rough idea of what is happening
here<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.610> some<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> more

here now on to some of the more
complicated<00:02:23.360> stuff<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.140> multi<00:02:24.500> floor<00:02:24.800> type

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
complicated stuff the multi floor type

our switch this is a design by generic B
and<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.630> won't<00:02:29.780> cover<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.200> too<00:02:30.410> much<00:02:30.560> because

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and I won't cover this too much because

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.890 
and I won't cover this too much because
he<00:02:31.130> has<00:02:31.220> done<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> fantastic<00:02:31.790> tutorial<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.780> it

he has done a fantastic tutorial on it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.210 
he has done a fantastic tutorial on it
though<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.350> will<00:02:33.590> include<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.130> the

though I will include it in the

though I will include it in the
description<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:35.209> what<00:02:35.390> this<00:02:35.510> allows<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:35.930> to

description but what this allows you to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.890 
description but what this allows you to
do<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.380> select<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:37.190> specific<00:02:37.430> floor<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.510> as<00:02:38.690> far

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
do is select a specific floor now as far

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.840 
do is select a specific floor now as far
as<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.260> actual<00:02:39.380> redstone<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> floor<00:02:40.700> is

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
as the actual redstone for the floor is

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.300 
as the actual redstone for the floor is
concerned<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.480> isn't<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.680> too<00:02:42.920> tricky

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
concerned it isn't really too tricky

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.240 
concerned it isn't really too tricky
what<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.300> here<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:45.140> piston<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:46.100> will

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
what we have here is a piston that will

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.009 
what we have here is a piston that will
retract<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.790> block<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.420> will<00:02:47.540> extend<00:02:47.900> the

retract the block that will extend the
piston<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.470> will<00:02:48.739> stop<00:02:49.010> us<00:02:49.220> from<00:02:49.400> actually

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
piston that will stop us from actually

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.240 
piston that will stop us from actually
going<00:02:50.000> upwards<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.540> also<00:02:51.319> we<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.799> pair<00:02:52.220> of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
going upwards and also we have a pair of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.699 
going upwards and also we have a pair of
doors<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.970> will<00:02:53.090> open<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.569> if<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:54.230> floor<00:02:54.530> is

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
doors that will open up if that floor is

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.860 
doors that will open up if that floor is
selected<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.489> for<00:02:55.760> example<00:02:56.180> we<00:02:56.600> currently

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
selected so for example we currently

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.289 
selected so for example we currently
have<00:02:57.290> floor<00:02:57.860> number<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.280> selected<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:58.970> as

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
have floor number one selected and as

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.910 
have floor number one selected and as
you<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.569> see<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> glass<00:03:00.019> doors<00:03:00.319> are<00:03:00.440> open<00:03:00.769> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
you can see the glass doors are open and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.190 
you can see the glass doors are open and
this<00:03:01.459> block<00:03:01.760> has<00:03:02.000> been<00:03:02.180> removed<00:03:02.540> which<00:03:02.989> means

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
this block has been removed which means

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.770 
this block has been removed which means
that<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.530> piston<00:03:03.980> cannot<00:03:04.459> extend<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.569> will

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
that this piston cannot extend so will

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.720 
that this piston cannot extend so will
just<00:03:05.930> be<00:03:06.080> pushed<00:03:06.350> out<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.799> elevator<00:03:07.160> if<00:03:07.430> we

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
just be pushed out of the elevator if we

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.190 
just be pushed out of the elevator if we
hit<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.000> button<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.480> will<00:03:08.630> see<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.900> happen

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
hit this button you will see that happen

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.920 
hit this button you will see that happen
now<00:03:09.350> look<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.400> piston<00:03:10.910> doesn't<00:03:11.540> extend

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
now look this piston doesn't extend

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.180 
now look this piston doesn't extend
which<00:03:12.170> means<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.560> we<00:03:12.650> can't<00:03:12.920> continue

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
which means that we can't continue

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.250 
which means that we can't continue
upwards<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.850> we<00:03:13.910> instead<00:03:14.660> just<00:03:14.810> get<00:03:15.019> pushed

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
upwards and we instead just get pushed

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.870 
upwards and we instead just get pushed
out<00:03:15.410> onto<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.739> floor<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.670> same

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
out onto this floor and it is the same

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.400 
out onto this floor and it is the same
for<00:03:17.120> all<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> others<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:17.959> if<00:03:18.109> we<00:03:18.260> select

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
for all of the others so if we select

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.080 
for all of the others so if we select
another<00:03:18.650> floor<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.430> will<00:03:19.579> see<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.880> this

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
another floor you will see that this

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.690 
another floor you will see that this
blog<00:03:20.359> gets<00:03:20.900> retracted<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.799> then<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.489> glass

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
blog gets retracted and then the glass

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.640 
blog gets retracted and then the glass
doors<00:03:23.000> open<00:03:23.299> up<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.690> when<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.019> hit<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.350> button

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
doors open up so when we hit the button

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.220 
doors open up so when we hit the button
and<00:03:24.859> then<00:03:25.340> go<00:03:25.370> up<00:03:25.760> there<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.480> should<00:03:26.540> see<00:03:27.019> that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
and then go up there we should see that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.770 
and then go up there we should see that
actually<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.370> piston<00:03:28.820> will<00:03:28.970> not<00:03:29.150> extend<00:03:29.480> and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
actually that piston will not extend and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.210 
actually that piston will not extend and
we<00:03:29.840> would<00:03:29.989> instead<00:03:30.320> be<00:03:30.380> pushed<00:03:30.769> out<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.100> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
we would instead be pushed out of the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.360 
we would instead be pushed out of the
elevator<00:03:32.019> now<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.049> have<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.500> admit<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:33.980> design

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
elevator now I have to admit this design

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.430 
elevator now I have to admit this design
is<00:03:34.670> not<00:03:34.700> without<00:03:35.120> its<00:03:35.329> flaws<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.930> first<00:03:36.200> one

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
is not without its flaws the first one

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.349 
is not without its flaws the first one
being<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.310> does<00:03:37.489> not<00:03:37.670> have<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> Down

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
being that it does not have a Down

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.880 
being that it does not have a Down
feature<00:03:38.870> if<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.140> was<00:03:39.290> ever<00:03:39.380> going<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.709> do<00:03:39.859> a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
feature if I was ever going to do a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.949 
feature if I was ever going to do a
tutorial<00:03:40.220> on<00:03:40.609> this<00:03:40.910> design<00:03:41.180> then<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.780> would

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
tutorial on this design then I would

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.240 
tutorial on this design then I would
make<00:03:42.140> sure<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.470> add<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.739> in<00:03:42.920> because<00:03:43.220> that

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
make sure to add that in because that

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.370 
make sure to add that in because that
really<00:03:43.820> would<00:03:44.000> complete<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.540> build<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.900> make

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
really would complete the build and make

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.960 
really would complete the build and make
it<00:03:45.530> something<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.829> I<00:03:45.950> would<00:03:46.250> want<00:03:46.430> in<00:03:46.760> my

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
it something that I would want in my

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.670 
it something that I would want in my
hermit<00:03:47.359> craft<00:03:47.630> base<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.140> next<00:03:48.260> thing<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.560> I

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
hermit craft base the next thing that I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.620 
hermit craft base the next thing that I
want<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.890> mention<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.299> not

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
want to mention is that it is not

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.080 
want to mention is that it is not
particularly<00:03:51.109> reliable<00:03:51.350> on<00:03:51.799> servers<00:03:52.459> more

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
particularly reliable on servers more

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.849 
particularly reliable on servers more
often<00:03:53.450> or<00:03:53.540> not<00:03:53.570> you<00:03:54.079> glitch<00:03:54.380> through<00:03:54.680> the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
often or not you glitch through the

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.500 
often or not you glitch through the
Pistons<00:03:55.070> before<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:55.940> have<00:03:56.060> reached<00:03:56.299> your

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
Pistons before you have reached your

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.270 
Pistons before you have reached your
desired<00:03:56.690> floor<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.859> really<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.250> a

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
desired floor and that really is a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.979 
desired floor and that really is a
problem<00:03:58.549> because<00:03:58.880> then<00:03:59.269> there<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.540> no<00:03:59.720> point

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
problem because then there is no point

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.960 
problem because then there is no point
in<00:04:00.230> there<00:04:00.410> being<00:04:00.590> an<00:04:00.709> elevator<00:04:01.069> if<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.760> want

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
in there being an elevator if you want

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.370 
in there being an elevator if you want
actually<00:04:02.269> going<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.569> make<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.109> where<00:04:03.230> you

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
actually going to make it to where you

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.650 
actually going to make it to where you
want<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.829> but<00:04:04.400> if<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:04.850> don't<00:04:05.060> mind<00:04:05.269> any<00:04:05.480> of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
want to be but if you don't mind any of

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.599 
want to be but if you don't mind any of
those<00:04:05.810> things<00:04:06.079> then<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.590> have<00:04:06.739> included<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.340> well

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
those things then I have included a well

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.099 
those things then I have included a well

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
so that you can check now for yourself

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.180 
so that you can check now for yourself
and<00:04:11.209> take<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> look<00:04:11.930> around<00:04:12.200> because<00:04:12.380> really<00:04:12.859> it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
and take a look around because really it

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.069 
and take a look around because really it
is<00:04:13.400> quite<00:04:13.670> interesting<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.780> design

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
is quite interesting and the design

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.099 
is quite interesting and the design
itself<00:04:15.440> is<00:04:15.650> pretty<00:04:15.889> good<00:04:16.160> but<00:04:16.789> unfortunately

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
itself is pretty good but unfortunately

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.300 
itself is pretty good but unfortunately
