00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello how about friends a greeting here 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.049
 we are with another new video tutorial in 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.260
 this case what will be done is 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.330
 uninstall the norton antivirus 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.640
 segurity of the 2015 version you already know that 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.020
 a few days ago I uploaded a video trying 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.910
 what is this antivirus the last 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.320
 2015 version because in this case what 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.380
 we're going to do is uninstall it and we're going to 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.840
 do correctly correctly we would have two 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.400
 ways to do it through panel 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.990
 of control and another downloading us a 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.970
 application that we can download from 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.550
 the page of norton in this case I would 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.929
 I will show the best option that would be 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.339
 download that application for 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.659
 uninstall the antivirus correctly 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.920
 that in the case that we have to 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.569
 back install again do not have 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 No conflict in any problem 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.620
 because we have been a no 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.729
 file on the computer in this case what 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.559
 first thing we 're going to do we 're going to open 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.199
 the explorer file explorer 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.129
 windows we are going to go to the unit 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.710
 program files we will have 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.030
 we locate the norton segurity folder and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.639
 what appears we are going to copy the name 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.989
 we simply copy the name because 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:59.120
 then at the end we will use it 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.760
 for the elimination of the registration of 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.589
 any file that may remain of the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
 uninstall in this case we can 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.740
 open a note and we will copy it here 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 we copy it and we can save it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.280
 simply because when we go to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 install with the application that we are going to 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.590
 to use we will have already and this note is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 to be able to copy and access the registry 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.520
 that I will also show later on 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 this case the first option that does not 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.780
 I recommend because there may be problems 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.399
 would go to the control panel 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.670
 we open control color panel 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.830
 all the elements of the control panel 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 we locate programs and features 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.670
 and once we locate where is the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.470
 norton segurity simply what 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.330
 we will select and uninstall 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.860
 well this would be the way we could 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.990
 use that most of us usually use 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 to uninstall program not in this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.049
 case I do not recommend this option because 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.190
 there may be some file that we have 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.929
 after some conflict at the time of 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.520
 back to be in the antivirus not in this 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.170
 case that would be the first option the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.209
 second action we do not want is what 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.409
 next we will copy the following 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.580
 link that I 'm going to leave in the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.610
 description of the video as always 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.929
 we select and copy we open the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.280
 browser and in the action bar of the 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.250
 we will stick browser let's 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.950
 access the norton support page 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.899
 puntocom here we are going to move a 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.359
 down to where we locate 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.100
 where does the first download the 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.980
 tool to uninstall products 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.660
 we click on it there and it opens a 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.490
 window to download the success as 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 this open norton renovate tool 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.270
 simply what we will do is save the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.100
 file once we have it saved 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.360
 we locate in the container folder what 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.760
 we drag and stick it on the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.590
 desk if we look here that as 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 comes already with as administrator 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.370
 we just double- click it and it's going 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.310
 to launch a new window asks you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.930
 permission we give him yes and he will open us 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.240
 a new window where we are going to 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.220
 inform about the applications that we can 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.590
 use to visit in this case as 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.360
 they are posted here at norton security backup 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.940
 in orton anti spam in norton antivirus 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.080
 from the 2003 version to the version 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.120
 2014 here in the next thing we will do is 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.490
 give in next we give a click in 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.800
 next we accept the terms 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.290
 we give in next we have to 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.290
 write the captcha we simply put 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.670
 and we will give you next we give you a click 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.010
 following 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.360
 Here he tells us that the elimination of 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.069
 program may take several minutes 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.130
 once the process has begun 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.200
 can stop it we give in next and 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.180
 will start the elimination then of 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.330
 the products that we have installed in 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.380
 our product team in norton 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.390
 We will have to wait for the process 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.730
 come to the end or the bar that we have 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.739
 here that we see that it is green 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.870
 then we reach the end and we see that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.970
 has begun to eliminate all the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.420
 files of 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.850
 norton antivirus and Segur 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.010
 we just want to wait for 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.430
 complete the elimination and 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.189
 uninstall the antivirus 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.230
 in this case, how will a ratillo take 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.640
 in uninstalling it just what I'm going 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.299
 to do is pause the video I'm not going to 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.299
 pause the video 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.360
 good friends, we continue, we see 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.010
 that we have already left that window 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.599
 complete norton renoval removal 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.060
 you have completed the operation of 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.290
 uninstall if it is not installed 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.819
 no active norton product 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.590
 Windows firmware if unoccupied 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.690
 must restart the computer now well then 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.489
 before restarting what we are going to do 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.979
 the following we press windows symbol 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.430
 r and in the window execute what 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.849
 we will do is write regedit we write 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.729
 regia bits 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.279
 regedit we open the register asks us 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.869
 permission we say yes in which 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.189
 let's be here in the registry as I already 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:40.080
 showed at the beginning of the video tutorial 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.110
 what we will do is copy the following 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.249
 what is the address or the name of the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.020
 program that we are going to eliminate this case 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.240
 would be norton segurity we select and 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.069
 we copy once we are here in the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.980
 record we are not going to edition unfold 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.930
 we are going to look for we are going in search 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.030
 we paste what we have copied into our 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.470
 sure and we will give you find next you 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.180
 we give a click this what it will do is search 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.300
 in the registry the folders and files 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.120
 they may have been of 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.069
 what is the norton antivirus but 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.840
 good what they can do is restart and 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.310
 once you restart it is to continue this 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.199
 process I do not do it now because I eat 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.340
 I'm doing the videotutorial would have 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.919
 to re-activate through again 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.330
 will reopen the chant and then by 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.940
 that the work you just what 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.490
 they do is reboot once they restart 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.990
 they follow this process they go to editing stick 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.340
 and we see that they are starting to come out here 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.530
 the folders simply what we would do 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.150
 is to select with the mouse button 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.349
 right and we eliminate once we 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
 we removed the first folder 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.770
 We would go back to editing and 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.020
 we should again look for next 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.610
 we will make this process until 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.590
 end open us a window of the 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.199
 record that is no longer found 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.330
 any folder file antivirus 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.340
 once we have done that already 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.590
 we could close what is the editor of the 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.509
 register and ready we would have then the 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.919
 antivirus in uninstalled correctly 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.270
 then one thing too we could 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.900
 to do is to use a program of 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.900
 elimination 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.990
 what is temporary files like the 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.060
 cd cleaner or we could also use 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.370
 some other very similar program for 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.570
 that the elimination either be complete 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.220
 and we have no problem at the time 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.410
 to reinstall then the antivirus 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.090
 no remains of the antivirus for good 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.590
 friends up here would be this video 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.200
 tutorial continue doing videotutorials 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.850
 the next thing I'll do then is to try another 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.190
 antivirus and give the corresponding note 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.570
 in this case until it would be this video 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.760
 tutorial I hope you have been 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.350
 great help a cordial greeting to the 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.350
 next video chao
