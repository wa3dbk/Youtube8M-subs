00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.219
 fortunately we don't have to wipe it 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.750
 a ladies and gentlemen because there 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:05.710
 are enough feminine clean in it 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.520
 find in horn 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.520
 inland 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.459
 but not all are born actresses 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.610
 for example, as Kate Upton has 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.140
 you bold about acting skills 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.990
 character and all those others are more 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.939
 born models and yes as a suitcase also the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.900
 filling to the white cloth padding is 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.740
 just a small step so I stand unique 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.359
 for the white screen 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.039
 ok then a little bit faint what i am 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.660
 say but they are also all for 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.820
 piece of stone nice so I actually think so 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.450
 not that they can whine but which 5 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.340
 actress jumped their career as a model and 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.039
 now we earn the most money as 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.230
 actress and that's why I kick off today with 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.800
 the very first to wiser tastiest 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.800
 actresses 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
 this woman okay probably not on the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.159
 model more to capture magazine 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.649

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.020
 with acting in 1995 including one 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.340

 they are in contact with people from the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.300
 and there is such a t see 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.310
 the clearer perhaps the two sense 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.220
