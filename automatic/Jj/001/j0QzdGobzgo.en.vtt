00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and then proxy server to not use it and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
and then proxy server to not use it and
I'm<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.399> exactly<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.170> does<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I'm not exactly sure what this does on

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.000 
I'm not exactly sure what this does on
Sony's<00:01:05.369> end<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.810> MTU<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
Sony's end but I do know that MTU is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
Sony's end but I do know that MTU is
basically<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> size<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> packets

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
basically like the size of the packets

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
basically like the size of the packets
of<00:01:09.900> data<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.740> sending<00:01:11.070> through<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of data that you're sending through to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
of data that you're sending through to
the<00:01:11.729> server<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.720> possible<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.320> Sony<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the server so it's possible that Sony is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.679 
the server so it's possible that Sony is
limiting<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.490> size<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.000> data<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.450> coming

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
limiting the size of data that's coming

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
limiting the size of data that's coming
through<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.470> prevent<00:01:16.799> any<00:01:16.950> more<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
through to prevent any more of the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.609 
through to prevent any more of the
broken<00:01:18.330> packets<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:19.259> receiving

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
broken packets that they're receiving

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.850 
broken packets that they're receiving
from<00:01:19.860> medida<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.790> did<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.500> able<00:01:22.680> to
