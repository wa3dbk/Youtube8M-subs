I'm going to let it sit for about 10
minutes<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:37.140> impatient<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.920> can

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
minutes if you're impatient you can

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
minutes if you're impatient you can
always<00:01:38.310> blow<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> polish<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.420> stir<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
always blow on the polish or stir it up

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.870 
always blow on the polish or stir it up
a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.860> bit<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> try<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.490> dry<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
a little bit to try and dry it out a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
a little bit to try and dry it out a
little<00:01:42.030> bit<00:01:42.150> faster<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.320> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> hard

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
little bit faster so it's kind of hard

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.520 
little bit faster so it's kind of hard
to<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.369> ankle<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
to see with my ankle but you want the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
to see with my ankle but you want the
consistency<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.180> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
consistency to be something like this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.080 
consistency to be something like this
where<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.140> strings<00:01:52.649> off<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
where you can get strings off of it and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.850 
where you can get strings off of it and
then<00:01:54.240> really<00:01:54.810> simply<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
then really simply you're just going to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
then really simply you're just going to
kind<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.840> scoop<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.049> gob<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> what<00:02:00.659> you're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
kind of scoop a gob up so what you're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.590 
kind of scoop a gob up so what you're
going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.229> grab<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.860> glob<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.600> your

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
going to do is grab that glob on your

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.750 
going to do is grab that glob on your
q-tip

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.210 

and<00:02:08.530> place<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.830> edge<00:02:10.010> of<00:02:10.160> your<00:02:10.220> nail

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and place it on the edge of your nail

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.110 
and place it on the edge of your nail
then<00:02:13.220> just<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> pick<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:13.880> pieces<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
then just going to pick up pieces and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.640 
then just going to pick up pieces and
string<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.240> across<00:02:17.480> your<00:02:17.540> nail

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.530 

once<00:02:26.370> you're<00:02:26.579> done<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.909> those<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.329> take

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
once you're done with those you can take

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.160 
once you're done with those you can take
a<00:02:27.689> q-tip<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.319> some<00:02:28.709> acetone<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.220> get<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.930> big

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
a q-tip with some acetone to get the big

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.170 
a q-tip with some acetone to get the big
pieces<00:02:31.439> off<00:02:31.799> and<00:02:32.159> then<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.760> use<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.909> brush

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
pieces off and then you can use a brush

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
pieces off and then you can use a brush
to<00:02:33.239> clean<00:02:33.510> up<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.290> any<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.099> pink

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that flooded into the cuticle area and

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.800 
that flooded into the cuticle area and
just<00:02:41.129> one<00:02:41.909> thing<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.329> important

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
just one thing that's really important

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.660

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
lifted up don't let it get so close to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
lifted up don't let it get so close to
the<00:02:47.849> nail<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> big<00:02:48.450> glob<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.989> get

big<00:02:49.500> chunks<00:02:49.859> like<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.579> messed<00:02:50.849> up<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.239> my<00:02:51.420> pinky

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
big chunks like I messed up on my pinky

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.690 
big chunks like I messed up on my pinky
finger<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.200> his<00:02:52.349> hand<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:53.159> I<00:02:53.280> kind<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.549> messed

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
finger on his hand and I kind of messed

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.630 
finger on his hand and I kind of messed
up<00:02:53.879> my<00:02:54.060> pointer<00:02:54.390> finger<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.900> also<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> yeah

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.280 
up my pointer finger here also so yeah
when<00:02:56.849> it's<00:02:57.000> all<00:02:57.209> finished<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.900> should<00:02:58.139> look

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
when it's all finished it should look

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.020 
when it's all finished it should look
something<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.250> I'm<00:02:59.670> kind<00:02:59.849> of<00:02:59.879> trying

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
something like this I'm kind of trying

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.520 
something like this I'm kind of trying
to<00:03:00.180> keep<00:03:00.329> my<00:03:00.510> pointer<00:03:00.810> finger<00:03:00.840> out<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
to keep my pointer finger out of the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.960 
to keep my pointer finger out of the
frame<00:03:01.769> because<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.099> messed<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.549> really<00:03:02.760> bad

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
frame because I messed it up really bad

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.250 
frame because I messed it up really bad
like<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.450> bit<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.629> time<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.989> dry<00:03:04.139> just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
like a little bit of time to dry just

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.250 
like a little bit of time to dry just
because<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.889> lines<00:03:05.129> are<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.519> thick<00:03:05.849> but<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
because the lines are so thick but you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.660 
because the lines are so thick but you
don't<00:03:07.440> want<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.650> add<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.799> top<00:03:08.069> coat<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
don't want to add a top coat to it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.300 
don't want to add a top coat to it
because<00:03:08.849> it'll<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.959> look<00:03:10.109> really<00:03:10.409> messy

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
because it'll just look really messy

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.369 
because it'll just look really messy
it's<00:03:11.819> supposed<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.359> be<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> little<00:03:12.810> bit<00:03:12.959> texture

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
it's supposed to be a little bit texture

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.660 
it's supposed to be a little bit texture
the<00:03:13.560> lines<00:03:13.709> are<00:03:13.889> supposed<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.129> stick<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.549> a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the lines are supposed to stick up a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.830 
the lines are supposed to stick up a
little<00:03:14.909> bit<00:03:15.030> something<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.389> takes<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.689> lot<00:03:15.810> of

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
little bit something that takes a lot of

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.449 
little bit something that takes a lot of
practice<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.530> messed<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.889> up<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.159> three<00:03:17.370> or

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
practice I messed it up like three or

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.429 
practice I messed it up like three or
four<00:03:17.489> times<00:03:17.730> before<00:03:17.909> I<00:03:18.150> actually<00:03:18.359> did<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.139> for

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
four times before I actually did it for

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.500 
four times before I actually did it for
the<00:03:19.530> video<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.829> guys<00:03:19.980> enjoyed<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.000> will
