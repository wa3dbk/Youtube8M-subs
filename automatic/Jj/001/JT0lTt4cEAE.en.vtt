 The brain thinks that the seal of this venture resource is pasted earlier, but this is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.330

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:40.240
 Then you're in a state of no edd sim 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 Usually that say whether to recognize the ends this housing unit Well then DIT will be in such form

 Really proud by that terminal 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.260
 Because the pattern is completely different 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.830
 Well this will install 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 It's an application 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:42.340
 The version of os or something else 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.620
 For example, an application to the midst of this installation is a 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:52.319
 I think to come also changes thereby Once you or stand up 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:56.110

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.440
 Because the program that is written is different 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.440

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.820
 Earlier I mentioned to Fu that do not when the application is up 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.860
 But 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.670
 With a lot of applications attached, it's pretty good with this kind of work 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.670
 Because I do not have 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:35.430
 That two middle ones 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:41.010

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:46.970
 As the application comes out , slide the application up and turn it off 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.970

 If you can not think with windows personal computer, application is increasing 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.449
 I will 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.499
 For example 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.639
 I hope Oh dropped only other g 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:10.500
 For example, this is also an application, but this 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:15.540
 Such a state when you double-click 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.110
 To slide and the other to be what is happening applications this I will be sorted in a row in high school to the top 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.110
 I will erase 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.160
 So raw Well now 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.900
 It's out of range with the data report that turns it off turned off 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.139
 First of all do not come where you want to try even Don 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.969
 It is abundant 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.929
 I'm searching now Where to use this 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.929
 Career came out 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.860
 It was nowhere grasp 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.340
 Yes 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:06:00.240
 If you grab this and do this 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:05.460
 The search may continue for a long time without grabbing the dishes if it was a work up seam 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.300
 There is also an application once and it is also possible to pick it up by repeating this several times without Nishi-Kido 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.629
 I also know the room 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:16.320
 That means I picked it up this time 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:19.380

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.540
 Forge under mobile data communication 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:26.270
 If you turn this on , you can say a little more and complicated settings to use 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.700

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:49.139
 If you have a wi-fi environment at home 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:50.580
 Regards you because I think that it is possible to use enough that without stress at 3g operation of 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.680
 I wish 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.880
