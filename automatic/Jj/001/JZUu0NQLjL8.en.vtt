them right don't you I know guilty too I
guess<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.540> could<00:03:08.720> say<00:03:08.960> that<00:03:08.990> that<00:03:09.500> shape<00:03:09.920> got

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
guess you could say that that shape got

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.610 
guess you could say that that shape got
exploited<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.270> maybe<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:11.930> corrupted<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.590> a

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
exploited and maybe then corrupted to a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.290 
exploited and maybe then corrupted to a
degree<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:15.110> guess<00:03:15.860> they<00:03:16.520> got<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> point

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
degree and I guess they got to the point

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.600 
degree and I guess they got to the point
where<00:03:17.600> respectable<00:03:18.530> painters<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.220> even<00:03:19.460> the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
where respectable painters and even the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.560 
where respectable painters and even the
signers<00:03:20.030> are<00:03:20.240> afraid<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:21.020> using<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.010> shape

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
signers are afraid of using that shape

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.180 
signers are afraid of using that shape
because<00:03:23.570> they're<00:03:23.750> afraid<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.200> work<00:03:24.740> will

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
because they're afraid that work will

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.650 
because they're afraid that work will
well<00:03:25.820> he<00:03:26.270> will<00:03:26.420> look<00:03:26.600> cheesy<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:29.030> there<00:03:29.540> is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
well he will look cheesy but there is

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.380 
well he will look cheesy but there is
nothing<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.110> fear<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:30.770> fear<00:03:31.190> itself<00:03:31.460> that's

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
nothing to fear but fear itself that's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.050 
nothing to fear but fear itself that's
why<00:03:32.570> we're<00:03:33.020> going<00:03:33.200> up<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.310> experiment<00:03:34.640> and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
why we're going up to the experiment and

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.970 
why we're going up to the experiment and
give<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.570> shot<00:03:35.810> here<00:03:36.140> when<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.590> think<00:03:36.890> about

give it a shot here when you think about

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.720 
give it a shot here when you think about

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
together convey the meaning of the piece

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.260 
together convey the meaning of the piece
but<00:04:16.850> when<00:04:17.030> you<00:04:17.150> think<00:04:17.359> about<00:04:17.510> it<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:18.170> is<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:20.030> is

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
but when you think about it it is it is

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.510 
but when you think about it it is it is
since<00:04:20.540> you're<00:04:20.750> in<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.960> way<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.230> make<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.680> collage

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.890 
since you're in a way to make it collage
and<00:04:22.970> assign<00:04:23.570> meaning<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.530> things<00:04:25.010> then

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
and assign meaning to things then

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.390 
and assign meaning to things then
squeeeeeeze<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.930> meaning<00:04:27.350> out<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.560> something

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
squeeeeeeze the meaning out of something
