actually<00:00:15.570> design<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> plane<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.289> actually

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
actually design a plane that actually

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
people to do badly just so they can do

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.819 
people to do badly just so they can do
well<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.540> challenging<00:00:54.199> but<00:00:54.440> at<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> same

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
well it's challenging but at the same

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.130 
well it's challenging but at the same
time<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.550> professor's<00:00:56.089> make<00:00:56.390> sure<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.019> your

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
time the professor's make sure that your

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.020 
time the professor's make sure that your
understanding<00:00:57.260> everything<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.550> then<00:00:58.699> also<00:00:58.879> I

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
understanding everything and then also I

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.060 
understanding everything and then also I
say<00:00:59.329> it's<00:00:59.510> been<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> lot<00:00:59.899> of<00:01:00.079> support<00:01:00.500> within

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
say it's been a lot of support within

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.710 
say it's been a lot of support within
the<00:01:01.280> department<00:01:01.850> because<00:01:02.120> it's<00:01:02.329> relatively

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
the department because it's relatively

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.320 
the department because it's relatively
small<00:01:03.229> we<00:01:03.739> work<00:01:03.890> as<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> team<00:01:04.159> pretty<00:01:04.550> much<00:01:04.640> I'm
