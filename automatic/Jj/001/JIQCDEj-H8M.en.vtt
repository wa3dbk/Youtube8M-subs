children exploring in creative play and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.120 
children exploring in creative play and
sort<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.700> having<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> children<00:02:17.300> lead<00:02:18.130> by

trying things out hands-on and discover

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.620 
trying things out hands-on and discover
and<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.740> think<00:02:21.980> being<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.820> parent<00:02:23.150> there<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.420> very

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
and I think being a parent there is very

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.170 
and I think being a parent there is very
similar<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.350> think<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.950> know<00:02:25.070> there's<00:02:25.760> there's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
similar I think you know there's there's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.420 
similar I think you know there's there's
not<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.510> prescribed<00:02:27.080> way<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:28.070> it's<00:02:28.310> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
not a prescribed way and so it's a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.870 
not a prescribed way and so it's a
really<00:02:28.730> wonderful<00:02:29.000> place<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.690> UM<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:31.459> discover

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
really wonderful place to UM to discover

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:43.000
