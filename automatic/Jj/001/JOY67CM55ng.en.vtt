 welcome back to graphic design tutorial video 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.779
 www.easy graphic. com 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.150
 today we see together one of the most important innovations 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.509
 a for the construction of lay-out d 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.509
 websites of websites 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.050
 or the fruit 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.929
 therefore this amber is at the same time 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.929
 it is to use mountains to beat up the clearer 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.290
 and within which media demo 2 tivusat 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 we will not call you right and left 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.450
 and then we begin immediately 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.489
 aladin free aenean container with you 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.489
 VidToMP3 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.630
 then free 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.630
 it right 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.670
 sini assistant 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 inside ddb from the right we try 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.890
 I'm sick of you text xd 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.880
 then 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600
 with html for now we have a cock 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 we move success s 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 let's start 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 as usual 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.500
 with normalization twirl is used for 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.320
 reset browser differences 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 and therefore margin padding 0 for all 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.500
 volley we see a gray color to bring out the colors of the wines better 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140
 container 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.440
 regularly 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.520
 we live 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 background-white color 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.120
 width 800 mixer 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.720
 and then I love you margin 20 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.380
 car 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.479
 his web pixel means 20 pixels below 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.859
 automatic right and left or the container will go 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.209
 fine in the center of the browser window 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.129
 now 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.459
 we see the attributes left and right 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.169
 to the right we say 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.479
 few weeks 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.929
 width 300 pixels height 300 pixels 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.509
 I love you colors 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.259
 na great colon we say rehab 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.229
 let's have a party in the usa 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.029

 color I love you white 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.429
 as for the dvd 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.769
 this left at 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.599
 practically horrors sex 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.509
 they are the same 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.509
 except you 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.759
 except for the brands background 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.569
 we can on 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.099
 brinner 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.599
 let's hope 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.629
 let's preview it 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.269
 on browser 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.189
 here is how it looks 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.129
 we have a container 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.599
 party in the middle of head 2 from white 18 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.569
 the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.569
 I will address are right and left ideals 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:20.279
 to do it 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.819
 on the right tv 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.029
 go 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.439
 each 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.509
 inside the VIP 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.579
 in which immediate 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.909
 eit the left to the left forem use the property 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.329
 so 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.329
 right daytek broken 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:43.510
 left 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.719
 from remo from claire 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.639
 we see 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.169
 let's see what happened 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.809
 the strom bidet 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.329
 went to the right 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.499
 the left from the left 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.499
 but as you can see hillel 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.969
 container has disappeared 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.819
 this is because the to make that the container 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.629
 you say women 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.209
 follow 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.469
 the 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.769
 bibiweb 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.370
 even if they are listed 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.359
 the sofas of a of fruit t 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.050
 inside it must also be fruity 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.289
 and consequently 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.889
 the only solution in this case 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.620
 will be to create another d 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.620
 that face the same that contains 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.879
 center two fingers 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.879
 we are all wind 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
 watch 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.740
 cont 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.469
 first of all cont 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.379
 we said of the container 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.379
 has a white color 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.759
 and has a width of 800 pixels but I give it 780 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.320
 because I your own padding to disconnect then go to the port 10 pixels e 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.319
 let's start the fruit property of the earth 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.300
 this will go on 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.210
 to align 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.270
 on the left the inside sale container 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:27.800
 in reality 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.440
 it would have been the same thing on the right because this cont occupies all of it 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 container space 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.169
 we return 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.839
 and here it is 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.249
 the hair 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:40.889
 the final result 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.939
 in practice therefore we have an up container 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.840
 which deals exclusively with positioning the site within the site 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.080
 browser window 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.400
 inside of 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.029
 a VIP 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.990
 which has the same width 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.240
 of the india container 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.350
 but friend wanted to fuck potato 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.360
 so he is able 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.499
 so to speak 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:08.960
 center 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.219
 the sculptor 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.219
 of the fleet elements within it 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:14.960
 hemp 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.779
 spume the last fundamental consideration regarding semantics 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.080
 as you can see we have built a different deep left 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.849
 imman in women 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.229
 m in reading 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.199
 we have tornadoes 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.199
 browser reads read dtt head first 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:36.699
 this because 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.900
 % clearly 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.289
 for 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.050
 grace enac flight 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.349
 the right mtv right comes first 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.610
 mm and goes immediately to the right of the cont 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.699
 normally when creating web sites 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.029
 create a point let's say a right side is a left part in which 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:02.869
 on the one hand there is the content of the cutroweb site on the content 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.059
 hairpro content of the site on the other side 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.820
 it is a container of 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.039
 link rebanne hair 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:14.689
 inal without what you want 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:18.080
 great consequently from the point of view of semantics 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.550
 then you can play 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.469
 in from this point of view 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.919
 yes your mindy content container 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:29.389
 the significant 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.869
 is the right 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:34.099
 sincerely you will go 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.379
 apt position first 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.680
 of the accident so that the browser reads 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.529
 before 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:42.919
 the content 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:45.110
 let's say meaningful of the site 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.009
 and then 

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:48.649
 then with in h1 

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:52.270
 gh2 cereal is in and then the secondary content 

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:54.969
 then the ma 

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:58.389
 a list of links just maybe a banner what you want 

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.569
 the 

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:03.629
 we have reached the end 

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:08.059
 so this video tutorial I just have to greet you as usual 

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:11.879
 and saura rmit of hito wa soon
