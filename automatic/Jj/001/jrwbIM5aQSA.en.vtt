00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:59.520 

eight<00:01:24.690> measures<00:01:24.990> arose<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> trio

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.440 

then<00:02:00.530> seven<00:02:01.280> measures<00:02:01.400> arrests<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:02.030> go<00:02:02.150> back

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
then seven measures arrests we go back

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.010 
then seven measures arrests we go back
to<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.470> sign<00:02:03.830> which<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.460> at<00:02:04.730> moderato<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
to the sign which is at moderato and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.889 
to the sign which is at moderato and
when<00:02:06.260> we<00:02:06.350> take<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.710> code<00:02:07.090> we<00:02:08.090> can<00:02:08.240> jump<00:02:08.660> down

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
when we take the code we can jump down

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.210 
when we take the code we can jump down
to<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.140> second<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.560> last<00:02:09.649> line<00:02:09.950> where<00:02:10.130> it

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
to the second to the last line where it

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:54.730 
to the second to the last line where it
says<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> that's<00:02:51.020> your<00:02:51.230> solo<00:02:51.730> yeah
