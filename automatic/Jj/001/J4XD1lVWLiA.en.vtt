00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
start off by saying I have this in my

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
start off by saying I have this in my
rough<00:00:54.960> order<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.250> teams<00:00:56.489> i<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
rough order of the teams i think that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
rough order of the teams i think that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
are the best um i could probably mix up

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
are the best um i could probably mix up
a<00:00:59.550> couple<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.090> these<00:01:00.690> may<00:01:00.930> be

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
a couple here and there these may be

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450 
a couple here and there these may be
different<00:01:01.500> depending<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.129> play<00:01:02.399> in

game but let me go ahead and dive into

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
game but let me go ahead and dive into
it<00:01:30.329> first<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> unanimous<00:01:31.560> best<00:01:32.189> team<00:01:32.490> in

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it first off the unanimous best team in

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
it first off the unanimous best team in
the<00:01:32.729> game<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.119> starting<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> separate<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the game is starting to separate is the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.499 
the game is starting to separate is the
49ers<00:01:36.140> their<00:01:37.140> defense<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.299> roided<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
49ers their defense is just roided and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
49ers their defense is just roided and
they<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.720> everything<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:40.880> offensively

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
they do everything and then offensively

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.359 
they do everything and then offensively
they're<00:01:42.390> only<00:01:42.600> flaw<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.189> really

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
they're only flaw is that they really

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
they're only flaw is that they really
can't<00:01:44.700> catch<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.060> traffic<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:46.229> here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
can't catch in traffic and right here

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.450

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
3d put that safety in a yellow he's been

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.520 
3d put that safety in a yellow he's been
hitting<00:03:29.640> us<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:30.030> route<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.540> few<00:03:31.320> times

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
hitting us with that route a few times

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.350 
hitting us with that route a few times
and<00:03:31.980> were<00:03:32.250> able<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.550> get<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> interception

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
and were able to get the interception

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.530 
and were able to get the interception
but<00:03:34.050> um<00:03:34.790> yeah<00:03:35.790> those<00:03:36.000> teams<00:03:36.240> are<00:03:36.360> going<00:03:36.480> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
but um yeah those teams are going to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.050 
but um yeah those teams are going to
give<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> best<00:03:36.930> chance<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.290> win<00:03:38.060> but

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
give you the best chance to win but

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.690 
give you the best chance to win but
again<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.260> definitely<00:03:40.470> use<00:03:40.680> other<00:03:41.340> teams

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
again you can definitely use other teams

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.600 
again you can definitely use other teams
and<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.330> think<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.750> left<00:03:42.930> off<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:44.130> being<00:03:44.459> my

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
and I think I left off of this being my

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.030 
and I think I left off of this being my
last<00:03:44.640> year's<00:03:45.090> Bengals<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> Bears<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.320> really

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
last year's Bengals the Bears I really

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.940 
last year's Bengals the Bears I really
just<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.490> their<00:03:47.730> offense<00:03:48.300> it's<00:03:48.890> perfect<00:03:49.890> for

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
just like their offense it's perfect for

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.250 
just like their offense it's perfect for
this<00:03:50.190> Arizona<00:03:50.730> scheme<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.690> use<00:03:51.930> them<00:03:52.110> i'll

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
this Arizona scheme if I use them i'll

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.800 
this Arizona scheme if I use them i'll
definitely<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.680> using<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.010> arizona<00:03:53.370> scheme

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
definitely be using the arizona scheme

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.300 
definitely be using the arizona scheme
