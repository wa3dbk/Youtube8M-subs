00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
felt like almost velvet type it's really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.100 
felt like almost velvet type it's really
lovely<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.710> tell<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:50.579> doing<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.110> what

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
lovely you can tell by doing that what

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.979 
lovely you can tell by doing that what
kind<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.500> fabric<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.840> its<00:00:54.840> really

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
kind of fabric it is and its really

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.979 
kind of fabric it is and its really
really<00:00:55.440> padded<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.100> well<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.239> neoprene

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
really padded as well it's it's neoprene

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
really padded as well it's it's neoprene
so<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.879> drop<00:01:00.090> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so if you drop it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
so if you drop it
I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.170> shock<00:01:01.440> absorbent<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
I think it's shock absorbent so that it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.880 
I think it's shock absorbent so that it
shouldn't<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.840> such<00:01:04.080> an<00:01:04.229> impact<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
shouldn't have such an impact on the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.090 
shouldn't have such an impact on the
laptop<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.610> break<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.840> fits<00:01:07.260> perfectly

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
this one's pink obviously it's not neon

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.460 
this one's pink obviously it's not neon
it's<00:02:17.970> slightly<00:02:18.420> darker<00:02:18.840> than<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.349> if

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
it's slightly darker than this one if

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.479 
it's slightly darker than this one if
you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.709> neon<00:02:23.040> it's

you can see and this one is neon it's

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.640 
you can see and this one is neon it's
the<00:02:23.730> yellows<00:02:24.030> version<00:02:24.480> which<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.170> really

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the yellows version which is really

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:34.120 
the yellows version which is really
bright<00:02:25.860> from<00:02:26.160> glowing<00:02:28.160> here's<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.220> closer<00:02:29.550> look

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.040 

so<00:02:35.130> they're<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.810> tell

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
so they're just the same as you can tell

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.120 
so they're just the same as you can tell
and<00:02:37.730> inside<00:02:38.730> these<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.630> exactly<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.709> same<00:02:40.920> as

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
and inside these is exactly the same as

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.270 
and inside these is exactly the same as
what's<00:02:41.370> inside<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.060> laptop<00:02:42.480> case<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
what's inside the laptop case the the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.300 
what's inside the laptop case the the
fluffy<00:02:44.940> felt<00:02:45.239> stuff<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.860> keeps<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.280> really

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
fluffy felt stuff so it keeps it really

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.330 
fluffy felt stuff so it keeps it really
snug<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:49.170> my<00:02:49.380> iPhone<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.160> show

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
snug and I have my iPhone here to show

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.780 
snug and I have my iPhone here to show
you<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.120> see<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.290> fits<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:53.489> a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you you can see that it fits in like a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.130 
you you can see that it fits in like a
snug<00:02:54.720> fit<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.489> there's<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:57.239> really<00:02:57.299> any<00:02:57.750> space

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
snug fit so there's not really any space

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.580 
snug fit so there's not really any space
on<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> sides<00:02:59.360> it's<00:03:00.360> quite<00:03:00.660> secure<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.440> then

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
on the sides it's quite secure and then

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.979
