they I mean the zoo map looked like a
zoo<00:01:22.110> map<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:22.890> sick<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.250> maybe

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
zoo map would be pretty sick so maybe

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
zoo map would be pretty sick so maybe
they<00:01:23.670> could<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.030> base<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.600> something

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
they could like base it off something

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
they could like base it off something
like<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.500> i<00:01:25.530> don't<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.740> cuz<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.159> well

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like that i don't know cuz like well

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.670 
like that i don't know cuz like well
then<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.229> don't<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.439> know

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
then I don't know I don't really know

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
then I don't know I don't really know
maybe<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.430> chained<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> maps

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
maybe they like chained to the maps

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
maybe they like chained to the maps
around<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.810> did<00:01:30.990> before<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.979> launch

right<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:49.369> mean<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.700> your<00:01:50.850> ideas<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
right I mean what are your ideas on this

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
right I mean what are your ideas on this
well<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.530> um<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.820> could<00:01:54.229> put<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
well I think um if they could put the I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.300 
well I think um if they could put the I
think<00:01:56.340> cuz<00:01:56.790> may<00:01:57.509> third<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:59.009> three

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
think cuz may third is about like three

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.590 
think cuz may third is about like three
quarters<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> way<00:01:59.969> before<00:02:00.149> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
quarters of the way before this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.450 
quarters of the way before this
blackouts<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.409> done<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.130> new

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
blackouts will be done because the new

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.480 
blackouts will be done because the new
one<00:02:02.610> mono<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.180> three<00:02:03.329> comes<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:04.490> December

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
one mono for three comes out in December

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
one mono for three comes out in December
so<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.079> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.320> out<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
so this is going to be out to be that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
so this is going to be out to be that
the<00:02:08.039> last<00:02:08.369> map<00:02:08.580> pack<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> second<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.450> last

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the last map pack of the second and last

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.540 
the last map pack of the second and last
minute<00:02:09.869> back<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.129> either<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
minute back so this is either going to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.190 
minute back so this is either going to
be<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.060> before

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
be have to be before

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.170 
be have to be before
mention<00:02:13.530> or<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.250> staring<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.030> whatever

mention or not staring it in whatever

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.990 
mention or not staring it in whatever
order<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.800> before<00:02:16.980> we're<00:02:17.640> gonna<00:02:17.760> have

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
order or right before we're gonna have
