well<00:01:33.180> chew<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> system<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.710> I'm

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
well chew on the system and what I'm

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
well chew on the system and what I'm
going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.939> I'm<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.240> turn<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
going to do is I'm gonna turn the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
going to do is I'm gonna turn the
squelch<00:01:37.110> off<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.740> you'll<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.100> able<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.460> hear

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
squelch off so you'll be able to hear

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.499 
squelch off so you'll be able to hear
all<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> background<00:01:39.630> noise<00:01:40.820> that's<00:01:41.820> that's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
all the background noise that's that's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
all the background noise that's that's
in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> ambient<00:01:43.259> water<00:01:43.470> around<00:01:44.340> us<00:01:44.520> today<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
in the ambient water around us today so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.609 
in the ambient water around us today so
I'll<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.270> ahead<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.689> turn<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> squash<00:01:46.350> off

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I'll go ahead and turn the squash off

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.050 
I'll go ahead and turn the squash off
see<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> sounds<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:19.290 

transmitted<00:01:51.320> channel<00:01:52.610> well<00:01:53.960> on<00:01:59.509> volume<00:02:00.920> turns

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.910 

so<00:02:20.300> what<00:02:20.480> we're<00:02:20.629> listening<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.200> now<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.470> the

so what we're listening to now is the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.309 
so what we're listening to now is the
ambient<00:02:22.310> noise<00:02:22.459> that's<00:02:22.970> mostly<00:02:23.330> biological

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
ambient noise that's mostly biological

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.710 
ambient noise that's mostly biological
it'll<00:02:24.530> be<00:02:24.650> shrimp<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.730> anything<00:02:26.269> else<00:02:26.420> that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
it'll be shrimp and anything else that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.080 
it'll be shrimp and anything else that
makes<00:02:26.900> noise<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> water<00:02:27.769> it<00:02:28.519> creates<00:02:28.730> a
