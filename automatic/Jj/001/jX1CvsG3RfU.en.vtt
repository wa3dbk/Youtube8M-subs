00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.060
 neither the liquid sealing primer can achieve 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.840
 under a waxed concrete 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.319
 a seal in the summer 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:10.839
 it will apply 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 secure 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.479
 multiple media 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.479
 porous supports besides support but 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.590
 this product is used 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.630
 when you want to seal 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 for example for a shower a washbasin 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.660
 and that the support is not already waterproof 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.500
 it is applicable 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.710
 on most media 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.770
 detour mortar plaster 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.500
 gypsum board 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.490
 mayence because age 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.120
 or even weight derived panels 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.590
 it is a liquid product 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.950
 after hardening forms a tightness 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 Inmates compliant ie soft waterproof membrane 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260
 elastic which is resistant to culture ensures 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.420
 to a certain extent, of course, refer to our data sheet 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.010
 the surface everything is fine 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.100
 in the duct is clean dust off scene rid of 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.660
 non-adherent parts 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.910
 it is essential that they are more example of traces of ember oil 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.930
 everything that could obviously be preventing or hindering the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 croatia product 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.370
 if you are on a very porous medium for example 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.420
 no gypsum board cardboard of cellular concrete tiles 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.170
 plaster 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.550
 it will of course be necessary to prepare the support in line toyer in the 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.480
 Dust Removal 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.950
 but especially applied in advance a first layer that produces that one 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.330
 will have diluted 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.650
 to one for with water that is to say a kilo of products 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.270
 and not a belier auto kit that makes a critical product that will allow 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.630
 to penetrate further undermine our support then the two layers 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.780
 traditional 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 that we will present to you will be applied 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.330
 you will apply at first 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.550
 in the enclosures paseo rather roll the product 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.060
 in relatively thick layers since we must in total have 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 2008 thickness costs so the first about 2000 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.300
 the application of the slope of 'strengthen' and in sensitive places 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.140
 the straps for example road also outreau is an old one that is sure 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.080
 that takes over first blame but it allows to have a small 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.849
 additional security 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.379
 the band makes this Morocco 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.550
 between two thicknesses applies the first was certainly 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.779
 of the product 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:36.909
 and then 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.589
 in good apply the tape over 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.589
 kaba morocco chasing them air bubbles laurent 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.619
 once the first layer is dry 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.849
 the band is haunted every nantes trial 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.409
 we go 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.799
 involved 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.919
 a bed 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.729
 so that the reinforcing strip is sandwiched between the two layers 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.119
 question reinforces 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.979
 resistance to writing 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 of the system 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.249
 the application would therefore be relatively changed 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:14.739
 alas not without knowing it 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.430
 that we put down well put the necessary thickness to know 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.949
 half a millimeter per layer so all one millimeter total 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.949
 and just to watch more and more consumption of products 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.689
 per square meter 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.039
 the product been studied 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.959
 on a closed support 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.289
 consume becomes worship 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.819
 per square meter 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.819
 be unbeaten a kilo per square meter per layer 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.859
 on a supporter but it was good that if you had to do beforehand 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.119
 preparation test 10 killed 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.359
 after for them 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.579
 it will take a little more stone products the support 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:55.739
 implicate them easy cross placement the product to be sure of 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.299
 well off by all 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.299
 and especially in a continuous culinary writing way to get 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.409
 one millimeter in a knife 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.779
 half a millimeter per layer 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:06.709
 do not forget 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.289
 that the previous layer 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.589
 so he worked products in three layers 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:14.589
 is useful for a very support for the foie gras product can be well 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.589
 and ensures perfect sealing and good resistance in case of defect 

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.699
 later 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:26.030
 the second layer and will have to put back applied and 24 to 48 hours after the 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.069
 first 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.349
 not too long after either 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.900
 for that villy is not henri what the film that the first layer is 

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:33.459
 damaged
