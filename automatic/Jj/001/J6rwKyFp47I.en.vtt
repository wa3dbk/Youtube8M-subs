guess you'd call lobbies on me they're
called<00:05:31.210> Rams<00:05:31.540> really<00:05:31.960> but<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:33.010> would<00:05:33.640> go<00:05:33.760> on

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
called Rams really but I would go on

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.570 
called Rams really but I would go on
public<00:05:34.150> matches<00:05:34.540> I<00:05:35.040> would<00:05:36.040> do<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:36.340> well<00:05:36.550> with

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
public matches I would do so well with

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.950 
public matches I would do so well with
him<00:05:36.850> just<00:05:37.060> cuz<00:05:37.240> he's<00:05:37.450> so<00:05:37.750> overpowered<00:05:38.670> but

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
him just cuz he's so overpowered but

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.450 
him just cuz he's so overpowered but
yeah<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.320> think<00:05:41.410> he's<00:05:41.650> gonna<00:05:41.740> be<00:05:41.860> like<00:05:42.100> really<00:05:42.340> a

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
yeah I think he's gonna be like really a

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.720 
yeah I think he's gonna be like really a
really<00:05:42.910> good<00:05:43.030> character<00:05:43.420> to<00:05:43.480> play<00:05:43.630> ads<00:05:43.870> but<00:05:44.770> my

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
really good character to play ads but my

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.310 
really good character to play ads but my
final<00:05:46.060> thoughts<00:05:46.300> on<00:05:46.540> is<00:05:46.750> he's<00:05:46.900> not<00:05:47.020> gonna<00:05:47.200> be

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
final thoughts on is he's not gonna be

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.240 
final thoughts on is he's not gonna be
as<00:05:47.500> good<00:05:47.530> as<00:05:47.740> scorpion<00:05:48.370> now<00:05:49.050> predator<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.350> think

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
as good as scorpion now predator I think

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.100 
as good as scorpion now predator I think
that<00:05:51.370> he<00:05:51.550> can<00:05:51.820> have<00:05:52.120> potential<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.720> be

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
that he can have potential to be

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.300 
that he can have potential to be
overpowered<00:05:53.950> if<00:05:54.250> they<00:05:54.580> do<00:05:54.850> him<00:05:55.090> right<00:05:55.590> but<00:05:56.590> I

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
overpowered if they do him right but I

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.160 
overpowered if they do him right but I
said<00:05:58.000> I<00:05:58.120> say<00:05:58.300> you<00:05:58.360> might<00:05:58.630> be<00:05:58.750> a<00:05:58.780> little<00:05:58.870> bit

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.560 
said I say you might be a little bit
more<00:05:59.320> power<00:05:59.740> than<00:06:00.070> Jason<00:06:00.700> and<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.060> long<00:06:01.240> run
