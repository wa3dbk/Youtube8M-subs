there was some communication error and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.679

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
Patroni and feel to it this one looks

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.689 
Patroni and feel to it this one looks
really<00:04:29.169> cool<00:04:29.500> but<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.889> appears<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:30.460> taken

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
really cool but it appears to have taken

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.580 
really cool but it appears to have taken
the<00:04:30.970> same<00:04:31.210> style<00:04:31.599> alternate<00:04:32.199> mode<00:04:32.410> as

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
the same style alternate mode as

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.559 
the same style alternate mode as
Megatron<00:04:32.949> in<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> sense<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.030> is<00:04:34.060> also<00:04:34.360> a

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
Megatron in the sense that it is also a

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.360 
Megatron in the sense that it is also a
silver<00:04:34.840> Cybertronian<00:04:35.680> tank<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:36.069> a<00:04:36.099> giant

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
silver Cybertronian tank with a giant

silver Cybertronian tank with a giant
turret<00:04:36.759> on<00:04:36.880> top<00:04:36.910> but<00:04:37.300> then<00:04:37.479> again<00:04:37.599> Megatron

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
turret on top but then again Megatron

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.110 
turret on top but then again Megatron
and<00:04:38.500> shockwave<00:04:39.069> did<00:04:39.340> originally<00:04:39.940> have

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
and shockwave did originally have

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.999 
and shockwave did originally have
similar<00:04:40.539> alternate<00:04:41.050> modes<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.620> some<00:04:41.800> ways

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
similar alternate modes so in some ways

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.620 
similar alternate modes so in some ways
this<00:04:42.280> is<00:04:42.460> being<00:04:42.669> loyal<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.240> original

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
this is being loyal to the original

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.180 
this is being loyal to the original
material<00:04:43.720> I'll<00:04:44.259> check<00:04:44.440> this<00:04:44.650> out<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:45.039> is<00:04:45.160> a

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
material I'll check this out it is a

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.010 
material I'll check this out it is a
possible<00:04:45.580> third<00:04:45.910> alternate<00:04:46.449> mode<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.870> is

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
possible third alternate mode that is

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.909 
possible third alternate mode that is
this<00:04:47.199> thing

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
this thing

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.710 
this thing
surrounded<00:04:48.370> by<00:04:48.400> tank<00:04:48.759> treads<00:04:49.060> I'm<00:04:49.270> wondering

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
surrounded by tank treads I'm wondering

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.360 
surrounded by tank treads I'm wondering
how<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:50.169> is<00:04:50.440> supposed<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.770> transform<00:04:51.250> into

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
how this is supposed to transform into

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.129 
how this is supposed to transform into
that<00:04:51.729> it<00:04:52.000> must<00:04:52.210> be<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> triple<00:04:52.690> changer<00:04:52.870> both

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
that it must be a triple changer both

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.050 
that it must be a triple changer both
concepts<00:04:53.680> are<00:04:53.830> very<00:04:53.860> unique<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:54.819> size

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
concepts are very unique I like the size

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.879 
concepts are very unique I like the size
of<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.300> first<00:04:55.539> one<00:04:55.720> but<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.139> like<00:04:56.349> how<00:04:56.560> sleek

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
of the first one but I like how sleek

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.950 
of the first one but I like how sleek
the<00:04:57.009> other<00:04:57.220> one<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.789> and<00:04:58.090> how<00:04:58.270> he<00:04:58.330> has<00:04:58.599> a<00:04:58.630> very

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the other one is and how he has a very

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.779 
the other one is and how he has a very
cool-looking<00:04:59.319> robot<00:05:00.009> mode<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.400> first<00:05:00.610> one

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
cool-looking robot mode the first one

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:01.920 
cool-looking robot mode the first one
looks<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.330> actually<00:05:01.630> should<00:05:01.690> be

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
looks like it actually should be

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.570 
looks like it actually should be
shockwave<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.919> second<00:05:03.220> one<00:05:03.310> kind<00:05:03.490> of

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
shockwave but the second one kind of

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.189 
shockwave but the second one kind of
looks<00:05:03.729> like<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:03.880> gun<00:05:04.120> damn<00:05:04.360> anyways<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:04.930> wouldn't

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
looks like a gun damn anyways I wouldn't

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.629 
looks like a gun damn anyways I wouldn't
