I'm going to be going over Formula One
steering<00:00:12.420> wheels<00:00:12.660> there's<00:00:13.380> an<00:00:13.769> incredible

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
steering wheels there's an incredible

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.740 
steering wheels there's an incredible
number<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.549> buttons<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> Formula<00:00:15.630> One

number of buttons on a Formula One
steering<00:00:16.170> wheel<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.010> I'm<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
steering wheel and so I'm just going to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
steering wheel and so I'm just going to
use<00:00:17.580> an<00:00:17.730> image<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.060> one<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> those<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.810> go

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
use an image of one of those and just go

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320 
use an image of one of those and just go
through<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.920> few<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.699> buttons<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.150> there

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
through a few of the buttons on there

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.820 
through a few of the buttons on there
not<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> them<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> good<00:00:22.350> amount<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
not all of them but a good amount and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.160 
not all of them but a good amount and
explain<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:24.060> they're<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.990> what

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
explain what they're there for and what

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.040 
explain what they're there for and what
they<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.609> okay<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> picture

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
they do okay so here we have a picture

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
they do okay so here we have a picture
of<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.680> Formula<00:00:29.130> One<00:00:29.160> steering<00:00:29.789> wheel<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
of a Formula One steering wheel it's a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
of a Formula One steering wheel it's a
little<00:00:30.689> older<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.199> model<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
little older of a model so it's not the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
little older of a model so it's not the
latest<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.420> nonetheless<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.530> over

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
latest but nonetheless I can go over

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
latest but nonetheless I can go over
quite<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> few<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.700> buttons<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> explain

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
quite a few of these buttons and explain

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.770 
quite a few of these buttons and explain
what<00:00:37.350> exactly<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> driver<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.940> by

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
what exactly the driver will do by

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
what exactly the driver will do by
tampering<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.530> these<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:41.129> buttons<00:00:41.670> so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
tampering with these these buttons so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.150 
tampering with these these buttons so
we'll<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.960> start<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.410> top<00:00:43.649> left<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
we'll just start up in the top left and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.060 
we'll just start up in the top left and
then<00:00:44.340> work<00:00:44.550> our<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> bottom<00:00:45.539> right<00:00:46.070> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
then work our way to the bottom right so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
then work our way to the bottom right so
we've<00:00:47.250> got<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> DRS<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> very<00:00:48.870> top

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
we've got the DRS up at the very top

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.200 
we've got the DRS up at the very top
left<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.890> button<00:00:50.219> number<00:00:50.460> 10<00:00:50.730> that's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
left that's that button number 10 that's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.330 
left that's that button number 10 that's
not<00:00:51.480> actually<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> DRS<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.070> steering

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
not actually for a DRS on this steering

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
not actually for a DRS on this steering
wheel<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.750> modern<00:00:54.899> steering<00:00:55.440> wheels

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
wheel but in the modern steering wheels

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
wheel but in the modern steering wheels
you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> DRS<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.329> drag<00:00:57.510> reduction

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you can see the DRS the drag reduction

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.090 
you can see the DRS the drag reduction
system<00:00:58.100> there<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> top<00:00:59.910> left<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> put

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
system there up in the top left so I put

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.429 
system there up in the top left so I put
that<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.489> anyways<00:01:02.850> moving<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> right

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
that there anyways moving to the right

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.820 
that there anyways moving to the right
we<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.820> shift<00:01:06.450> lights<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.110> row

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
we can see these shift lights this row

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.690 
we can see these shift lights this row
of<00:01:08.390> lights<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> single<00:01:10.049> row<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
of lights the single row here and so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.810 
of lights the single row here and so
that<00:01:12.299> will<00:01:12.450> tell<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.830> optimum<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that will tell you your optimum time to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
that will tell you your optimum time to
shift<00:01:15.060> gears<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.290> light<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.650> across

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
shift gears so it will light up across

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.350 
shift gears so it will light up across
and<00:01:17.720> let<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.080> when<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> shift<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> then

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and let you know when to shift so then

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
and let you know when to shift so then
if<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> way<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.890> where

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
if we go all the way to the right where

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
if we go all the way to the right where
that<00:01:23.880> number<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.990> we've<00:01:25.710> got<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> curves

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that number one is we've got the curves

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
that number one is we've got the curves
activation<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:27.930> once<00:01:28.229> again<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
activation now once again in this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
activation now once again in this
steering<00:01:29.070> wheel<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.640> actually<00:01:30.210> kurz

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
steering wheel it's not actually kurz

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
steering wheel it's not actually kurz
activation<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> where<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> might

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
activation but this is where you might

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
activation but this is where you might
find<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> modern<00:01:33.810> steering<00:01:34.200> wheel<00:01:34.350> so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
find it on a modern steering wheel so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
find it on a modern steering wheel so
following<00:01:35.909> along<00:01:36.150> left<00:01:36.509> we've<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
following along left we've got these a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080 
following along left we've got these a
group<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.920> three<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.490> lights<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:39.060> there

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
group of three little lights right there

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
group of three little lights right there
that<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.720> cluster<00:01:39.960> those<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.950> Marshall

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that little cluster those are Marshall

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
that little cluster those are Marshall
lights<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.240> those<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.079> light<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.470> if

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
lights and so those will light up if

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.249 
lights and so those will light up if
there's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> flag<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:45.210> example<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> say<00:01:46.079> there

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
there's a flag for example and say there

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
there's a flag for example and say there
was<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> crash<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.759> yellow<00:01:48.030> flag

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
was a crash and they do a yellow flag

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
was a crash and they do a yellow flag
for<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> incident<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.770> these<00:01:49.979> will<00:01:50.189> let<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
for the incident then these will let you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
for the incident then these will let you
know<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:51.060> necessarily<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
know so you don't necessarily have to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350 
know so you don't necessarily have to
have<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.460> marshals<00:01:53.880> waving<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
have to see the marshals waving the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.440 
have to see the marshals waving the
flags<00:01:55.369> ok<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> center<00:01:57.240> you've

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
flags ok so then in the center you've

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
flags ok so then in the center you've
got<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:58.079> info<00:01:58.710> display<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.700> can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
got the info display and so that can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.600 
got the info display and so that can
show<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> things<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.600> lap<00:02:01.380> times<00:02:01.740> split

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
show you things like lap times split

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.300 
show you things like lap times split
times<00:02:03.409> if<00:02:04.409> there's<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.740> problem<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.189> your

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
times if there's a problem with your

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.370 
times if there's a problem with your
engine<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.149> display<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.630> there<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.350> very

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
engine it can display it there so very

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.270 
engine it can display it there so very
useful<00:02:07.829> display<00:02:09.289> moving<00:02:10.289> further<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
useful display moving further to the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
useful display moving further to the
left<00:02:11.629> we've<00:02:12.629> got<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.110> neutral

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
left we've got the neutral

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
left we've got the neutral
button<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.489> now<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.030> does<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.080> have

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
button so now what this does is you have

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.550 
button so now what this does is you have
to<00:02:16.470> hold<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:17.340> button<00:02:17.640> down<00:02:18.230> before<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.379> can

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
to hold this button down before you can

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.710 
to hold this button down before you can
shift<00:02:19.830> into<00:02:20.069> neutral<00:02:20.550> basically<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.390> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
shift into neutral basically if you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.390 
shift into neutral basically if you
don't<00:02:21.930> hold<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.349> can't<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:22.800> into<00:02:23.040> neutral

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
don't hold it you can't get into neutral

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.339 
don't hold it you can't get into neutral
so<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.760> safety<00:02:24.030> feature<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
so it's a safety feature so that if you

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.710 
so it's a safety feature so that if you
keep<00:02:25.560> down<00:02:25.769> shifting<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.910> don't<00:02:27.150> downshift

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
keep down shifting you don't downshift

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.460 
keep down shifting you don't downshift
past<00:02:28.170> first<00:02:28.530> gear<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.629> then<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> left

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
past first gear and so then to the left

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.140 
past first gear and so then to the left
of<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.769> which<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.040> can't<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.580> see<00:02:32.910> but

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
of that which you can't really see but

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.449 
of that which you can't really see but
there<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> flat<00:02:34.170> back<00:02:34.440> there<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:35.190> allows

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
there is a flat back there that allows

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.030 
there is a flat back there that allows
you<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:35.940> shift<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.470> reason<00:02:37.830> why<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
you to up shift so the reason why the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.220 
you to up shift so the reason why the
neutral<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.910> left<00:02:39.120> side<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.049> gear

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
neutral is on the left side and the gear

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630 
neutral is on the left side and the gear
down<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.709> right<00:02:40.920> side<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
down is on the right side so that you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.740 
down is on the right side so that you
can<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.910> one<00:02:42.090> hand<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.629> each<00:02:44.030> okay<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.090> we'll

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
can have one hand on each okay so we'll

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.140 
can have one hand on each okay so we'll
move<00:02:45.959> over<00:02:46.290> across<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.519> center

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
move over across to these center

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.819 
move over across to these center
differential<00:02:48.599> settings<00:02:49.170> or<00:02:49.470> corner

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
differential settings or corner

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.490 
differential settings or corner
differential<00:02:50.579> settings<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.989> what<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
differential settings and so what that

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.250 
differential settings and so what that
does<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.730> alter<00:02:54.150> your<00:02:54.660> differential

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
does is you can alter your differential

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.589 
does is you can alter your differential
how<00:02:55.380> much<00:02:55.560> slip<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> allow<00:02:56.670> while

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
how much slip you want to allow while

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.780 
how much slip you want to allow while
you're<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.959> corner<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.400> outside

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
you're in a corner so that the outside

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.000 
you're in a corner so that the outside
tire<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.329> rotate<00:03:00.510> faster<00:03:01.200> than<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> inside

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
tire can rotate faster than the inside

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.319 
tire can rotate faster than the inside
tire<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.829> right<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.519> have<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
tire so to the right of that we have the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.979 
tire so to the right of that we have the
pit<00:03:06.690> lane<00:03:06.900> speed<00:03:07.590> limiter<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.329> so<00:03:09.329> what<00:03:09.840> that

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
pit lane speed limiter and so what that

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.080 
pit lane speed limiter and so what that
button<00:03:10.260> does<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.920> limits<00:03:11.220> your<00:03:11.400> speed<00:03:11.730> to

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
button does is it limits your speed to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.319 
button does is it limits your speed to
100<00:03:12.840> km/h<00:03:13.470> which<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.670> maximum<00:03:15.060> speed

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
100 km/h which is the maximum speed

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.470 
100 km/h which is the maximum speed
allowed<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> pit<00:03:16.200> lanes<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.329> move

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
allowed in the pit lanes so if we move

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.420 
allowed in the pit lanes so if we move
down<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:19.260> see<00:03:19.440> behind<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:20.069> it's<00:03:20.220> kind

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
down you can see behind there it's kind

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.430 
down you can see behind there it's kind
of<00:03:20.459> dark<00:03:20.670> but<00:03:20.940> that's<00:03:21.150> where<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.780> gear<00:03:22.230> down

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
of dark but that's where the gear down

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.860 
of dark but that's where the gear down
pedal<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:24.410> right<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.739> left<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
pedal is right to the left of that is

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.080 
pedal is right to the left of that is
the<00:03:27.870> pit<00:03:28.470> communication<00:03:29.280> button<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.790> radio

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the pit communication button the radio

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.000 
the pit communication button the radio
button<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.170> if<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.889> communicate

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010

center of the wheel there is a torque
selector<00:03:42.329> now<00:03:42.810> what<00:03:43.049> this<00:03:43.169> does<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:44.099> alters

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
selector now what this does is it alters

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.409 
selector now what this does is it alters
how<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.950> power<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.220> create<00:03:47.639> depending<00:03:48.329> on

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
how much a power you create depending on

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.089 
how much a power you create depending on
how<00:03:48.540> much<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.870> push<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.349> gas<00:03:49.560> pedal

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
how much you push in the gas pedal

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.210 
how much you push in the gas pedal
so<00:03:50.790> say<00:03:51.599> it's<00:03:51.780> raining<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.709> don't<00:03:53.040> want

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
so say it's raining and you don't want

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.650 
so say it's raining and you don't want
the<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.609> gas<00:03:53.760> pedal<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.120> be<00:03:54.299> quite<00:03:54.510> as

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
the the gas pedal to be quite as

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.470 
the the gas pedal to be quite as
sensitive<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:55.680> turn<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.280> down<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:57.239> that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
sensitive you can turn it down so that

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.650 
sensitive you can turn it down so that
the<00:03:57.630> more<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.930> push<00:03:58.139> in<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.440> gas<00:03:58.620> pedal<00:03:59.069> it

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
the more you push in the gas pedal it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.300 
the more you push in the gas pedal it
doesn't<00:04:00.660> quite<00:04:00.959> as<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.650> doesn't<00:04:01.950> give<00:04:02.069> quite

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
doesn't quite as it doesn't give quite

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.509 
doesn't quite as it doesn't give quite
as<00:04:02.459> much<00:04:02.639> power<00:04:02.910> as<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.419> would<00:04:04.250> say<00:04:05.250> if<00:04:05.400> you

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
as much power as it would say if you

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.890 
as much power as it would say if you
were<00:04:05.609> in<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.760> different<00:04:05.880> setting<00:04:06.329> say<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.780> was

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
were in a different setting say it was

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.690 
were in a different setting say it was
dry<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.440> warm<00:04:07.680> outside<00:04:08.160> where<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.400> knew<00:04:08.579> you

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
dry and warm outside where you knew you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.920 
dry and warm outside where you knew you
had<00:04:08.880> better<00:04:09.060> grip<00:04:09.709> so<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.799> can<00:04:10.950> alter<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.930> gas

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
had better grip so you can alter the gas

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.039 
had better grip so you can alter the gas
pedal<00:04:13.319> with<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:14.209> so<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.569> left<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
pedal with that so to the left of that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.190 
pedal with that so to the left of that
we<00:04:16.289> have<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> rev<00:04:17.070> limiter<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.849> so<00:04:18.690> very

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
we have a rev limiter and so very

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.500 
we have a rev limiter and so very
common-sense<00:04:19.950> thing<00:04:20.519> here<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.180> can

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
common-sense thing here you just can

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.909 
common-sense thing here you just can
limit<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.019> rebbe<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.440> your<00:04:22.620> engine<00:04:24.919> right

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
limit the rebbe of your engine right

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.050 
limit the rebbe of your engine right
below<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.370> we've

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
below that we've

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.030 
below that we've
fuel<00:04:27.510> mixtures<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.410> if<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.680> think<00:04:28.889> you're

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
fuel mixtures so if you think you're

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.770 
fuel mixtures so if you think you're
running<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.430> little<00:04:29.580> lean<00:04:29.850> or<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.240> little<00:04:30.540> rich

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
running a little lean or a little rich

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.310 
running a little lean or a little rich
you<00:04:31.410> can<00:04:31.590> alter<00:04:32.010> that<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:33.120> less<00:04:33.750> lean<00:04:34.020> or<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
you can alter that to a less lean or a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.580 
you can alter that to a less lean or a
less<00:04:35.250> rich<00:04:35.520> mixture<00:04:36.360> or<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:37.320> other<00:04:37.440> way

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
less rich mixture or the other way

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.330 
less rich mixture or the other way
around<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.990> left<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.590> there<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.100> an

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
around to the left of that there is an

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.510 
around to the left of that there is an
oil<00:04:41.880> pump<00:04:42.300> button<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.590> basically<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.400> is

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
oil pump button and so basically this is

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.750 
oil pump button and so basically this is
a<00:04:44.550> backup<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.570> your<00:04:45.720> oil<00:04:45.750> pump<00:04:46.169> fails

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
a backup so if your oil pump fails

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.070 
a backup so if your oil pump fails
that's<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.910> pretty<00:04:48.120> big<00:04:48.300> problem<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:48.960> can

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
that's a pretty big problem so you can

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.720 
that's a pretty big problem so you can
press<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:49.560> button<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.950> it'll<00:04:50.130> kick<00:04:50.340> in<00:04:50.550> a

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
press this button and it'll kick in a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.920 
press this button and it'll kick in a
backup<00:04:51.480> pump<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.620> you<00:04:52.830> can<00:04:52.980> keep<00:04:53.310> raising

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
backup pump so that you can keep raising

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.540 
backup pump so that you can keep raising
at<00:04:54.930> least<00:04:55.169> until<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.560> get<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.800> pits<00:04:56.040> or<00:04:56.280> figure

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
at least until you get to pits or figure

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.690 
at least until you get to pits or figure
out<00:04:56.669> what<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.910> problem<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:59.310> below

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
out what the problem is and so below

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.850 
out what the problem is and so below
that<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.300> right<00:05:00.479> is<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.050> reverse<00:05:01.530> button

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
that to the right is the reverse button

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.340 
that to the right is the reverse button
and<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.490> just<00:05:02.700> like<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.060> neutral<00:05:03.479> button<00:05:03.720> you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
and so just like the neutral button you

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.740 
and so just like the neutral button you
would<00:05:04.500> press<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.520> then<00:05:05.970> press<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.540> gap

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
would press this and then press the gap

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.010 
would press this and then press the gap
down<00:05:07.500> gear<00:05:08.040> shift<00:05:08.760> button<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:09.750> then<00:05:09.900> you

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
down gear shift button and so then you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.810 
down gear shift button and so then you
could<00:05:10.139> get<00:05:10.380> into<00:05:10.710> reverse<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.340> won't<00:05:11.550> allow

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
could get into reverse it won't allow

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.280 
could get into reverse it won't allow
you<00:05:11.880> unless<00:05:12.450> you're<00:05:12.660> holding<00:05:12.750> this<00:05:13.050> button

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
you unless you're holding this button

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.140 
you unless you're holding this button
and<00:05:13.530> that's<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:14.070> safety<00:05:14.310> feature<00:05:14.460> so<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.000> you

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
and that's a safety feature so that you

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.340 
and that's a safety feature so that you
don't<00:05:15.300> accidentally<00:05:15.750> go<00:05:15.960> into<00:05:16.139> reverse

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.260 

alright<00:05:19.350> so<00:05:19.590> moving<00:05:20.100> over<00:05:20.550> we've<00:05:20.729> got<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.500 
rehydrate so that's a great thing for
the<00:05:38.910> drivers<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:41.430> right<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.789> that<00:05:42.030> we<00:05:42.330> have

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
the drivers to the right of that we have
