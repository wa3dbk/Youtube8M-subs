00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:04.779
 the DTM too 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.929
 were more dangerous few weeks before 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.099
 and I told her about it 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.969
 around the word here 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.409
 yes that whatever he chooses 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.500
 in the conflict around and Wolfsburg 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.430
 there is one 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.619
 if castle Klopp the XXI 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.960
 In any case, there are around 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.789
 just set the maximum lengths and heights you could change again 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 Revenue if you now in the all too big and that does not work 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.020
 Percent to very high offspring need to become a conflict 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.200
 the right-click noise levels on the money the money goes up 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.630
 unfortunately around now says 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.820
 Take a can of tenants tight 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.050
 finally it is true 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.970
 if the woman has to say 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.320
 it has said that several times 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.320
 yes I 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.690
 Dueck a scandal and women 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.130
 Donkey Kong India 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.650
 I am on the track of the matter 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.710
 um and that with the field contactor percent to data we think I poses one 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.170
 at that time in cases estimates that all signs are protected 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.500
 and around the quarter has shown every time that is OK but also around 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.290
 many times if puck display 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 Lustenberger lie 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.869
 so you would have to first live the stronger shaped hair samples guest 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 around 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.110
 Year is as it is and then someone comes across video fix 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.229
 Petra Fuchs Andersch Mavs either as said in a dock TXT is located 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.570
 also around 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.650
 So here's a list of materials for the bridge 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.760
 that sees us moving towards us 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.390
 p 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.750
 and that at the beginning of wood not to write thick upholstery can also 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.330
 write golden yellow 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.390
 definitely 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.700
 Würth at the beginning 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.990
 The mothers are not allowed to stand by the wood, that's not allowed to build from wood 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.280
 you're just into the conflict issues and there 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.260
 So write 5 percent in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.310
 where does Boxster just need 5 or now they would be blotting 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.889
 Yes 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.829
 It's really easy to get Massa's harvest lift 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.859
 I have not built that yet 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.389
 around dapd b 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.560
 so we will need for our small area here 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.739
 together 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.739
 DAPD-hes 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.889
 so the first sign to understand like up here 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.739
 The writing of the man should be Harald thumb 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.139
 when he should go down 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.979
 and it wants 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.869
 once up 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.229
 the second row of square brackets lives off 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.969
 Sar and that is wonderful as he will we are above 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.969
 under 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.459
 then you can still order, for example 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.209
 to replace it with a yell 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.589
 around 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.039
 I have to deal with so many first percent »write because you start there 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.979
 and that drives or something 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.570
 and then you can go around there 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.860
 that could also show miscellaneous javelin throw in a row the mined 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
 for milk fat 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.939
 so if now come up he will be so IFC Gey displayed and so could the 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.279
 without having to do it again 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.380
 that's really handy of even Eckart Würzner experimenting around 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.680
 that was five as a book on questions you know what you have to do and me 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.390
 then say goodbye
