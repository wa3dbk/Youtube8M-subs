00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
whole new focus on sustainability what's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
whole new focus on sustainability what's
really<00:00:22.109> special<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> brand<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
really special about the I brand is it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.570 
really special about the I brand is it
has<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> new<00:00:24.359> architecture<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:26.010> call<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> life

has a new architecture we call the life

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
has a new architecture we call the life
drive<00:00:26.820> architecture<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.570> divide<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.260> cars

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the same electric motor that we have in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.479 
the same electric motor that we have in
the<00:02:03.450> i3<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.049> drive<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.500> front<00:02:04.709> wheels<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
the i3 to drive the front wheels and a

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.190 
the i3 to drive the front wheels and a
three<00:02:05.700> cylinder<00:02:06.030> gasoline<00:02:06.329> motor<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:07.109> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
three cylinder gasoline motor over the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.050 
three cylinder gasoline motor over the
rear<00:02:07.349> wheel<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.739> in<00:02:07.890> essence<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.789> all

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
rear wheel so in essence you have all

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.390 
rear wheel so in essence you have all
wheel<00:02:09.479> drive<00:02:09.780> available<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> together<00:02:10.799> they

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
wheel drive available and together they

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.270 
wheel drive available and together they
provide<00:02:11.879> almost<00:02:12.060> 400<00:02:12.629> horsepower<00:02:12.870> zero<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:13.950> 60

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
provide almost 400 horsepower zero to 60

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.220 
provide almost 400 horsepower zero to 60

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
line work the servicing you can see very

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.449 
line work the servicing you can see very
clearly<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.139> if<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.920> wind<00:02:26.190> that

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
clearly that it's as if the wind that

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.580 
clearly that it's as if the wind that
the<00:02:26.489> aerodynamics<00:02:27.299> have<00:02:27.510> shaped<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.049> car<00:02:28.349> for

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the aerodynamics have shaped the car for

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.930 
the aerodynamics have shaped the car for
us<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.220> wanted<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.519> give<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
us and we wanted to give you that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.059 
us and we wanted to give you that
impression<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.630> extremely<00:02:31.079> dynamic<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.980> in

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
impression it's extremely dynamic and in

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.940 
impression it's extremely dynamic and in
that<00:02:32.220> way<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.579> still<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.180> much<00:02:33.419> BMW

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that way it's still very much BMW

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.170 
that way it's still very much BMW
what's<00:02:36.950> really<00:02:37.130> impressive<00:02:37.400> about<00:02:37.850> both<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
what's really impressive about both the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.760 
what's really impressive about both the
i3<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.570> i8<00:02:38.660> when<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.080> see<00:02:39.230> them<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.470> pictures

purpose built electric solutions this is

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.280 
purpose built electric solutions this is
going<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.290> BMW<00:02:51.890> I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290
