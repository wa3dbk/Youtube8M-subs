00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.590
 as I put 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.260
 yes to the pants open with mac less and less skirts I like best i 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.269
 pants because they are free to move 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.490
 you want to comment and therefore also my thoughts are freer because 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.089
 you're not me 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.630
 but the physicist recalls his thoughts 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.179
 speech magistrate ie 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.220
 when a female TV dress 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.029
 forces everyone to have a future 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.219
 because heel 12 because he thinks of mystery. or 76 silonite 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 and if so how not. here is a mask 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.340
 also passages do you know this very well 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.450
 we wear continuous masks even this mask there is a whole road 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.420
 secondary mask that you become 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 you too feeling your behavior 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 of the character that that mask makes you feel that the times in which you are 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 turns 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.540
 your feeling changes with a feeling that I miss you together then 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.660
 dressed like that 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 I am here 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.310
 more likely induced to think 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.640
 and key to feel a certain way if I put the heel 12 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.320
 institute code altogether 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.140
 hey mac os etcetera etc. I am led to have another feeling of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.540
 they say that a cd like milvus has rolled up 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.590
 then 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.859
 I like 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.340
 the most neutral clothing possible as comfortable as possible because this 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.170
 it makes you feel much more than you 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.020
 I did not think 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 while I was ironing 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.049
 because we women can put her clothes on 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.509
 the tires that the 10-man pants only lie pants pants 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.600
 knickerbockers 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.090
 shorts but always pants because not because it does not go 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 because they don't even wear clothes 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.950
 I once went to the Litta theater in Milan 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.790
 a winter maybe two winters ago 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.870
 I saw some bmi madness of the theater before impulses expect if yes 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.520
 waited for it to wait to enter the room 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.899
 a boy entered 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.279
 girl with evening dress 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.389

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:15.649

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.739
 cool summer sandals shoes although it was winter 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.349
 for women with high heels but not touched 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.889
 it's just that he had worn 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.649
 a feminine dress 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.689
 feeling 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.869
 he was beautiful, I swear 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 it gave me a sense - of 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.639
 one breathes when these divine things happen 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.739
 fantasy of freedom freedom even a form not so much exhibitionist 400 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.689

 the bows on the stairs 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.559
 but why the designers 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.749
 treat us like dolls oh like bitches 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.889
