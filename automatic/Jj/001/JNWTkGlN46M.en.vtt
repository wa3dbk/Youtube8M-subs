of solar panel at the top and that's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
of solar panel at the top and that's
designed<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> recharge<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> built-in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
designed to recharge the built-in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.810 
designed to recharge the built-in
battery<00:00:30.380> with<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.769> any<00:00:31.980> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> light

source that could be Sun a lamp anything
and<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.750> keep<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> battery<00:00:37.500> charged

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
different devices there are three

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
different devices there are three
buttons<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.649> top<00:00:55.739> they'll<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
buttons at the top they'll have that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.299

little bluetooth logo on them and you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.150 
little bluetooth logo on them and you
can<00:00:59.460> basically<00:00:59.640> pair<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:01.379> mac

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
can basically pair this with a mac

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.660 
can basically pair this with a mac
desktop<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> ipad<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.409> iphone<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
desktop and ipad and iphone this is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.630 
desktop and ipad and iphone this is
ostensibly<00:01:06.150> designed<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.380> Mac<00:01:07.740> products<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
ostensibly designed for Mac products it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.050 
ostensibly designed for Mac products it
does<00:01:09.150> also<00:01:09.450> pair<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.890> Windows<00:01:11.369> machines<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
does also pair with Windows machines and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
does also pair with Windows machines and
Android<00:01:12.479> devices<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> keyboard<00:01:13.380> layout

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
Android devices but the keyboard layout

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.660 
Android devices but the keyboard layout
is<00:01:14.100> Mac<00:01:14.790> centric<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.780> mostly<00:01:16.290> people<00:01:16.860> who<00:01:17.400> have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is Mac centric so mostly people who have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.749 
is Mac centric so mostly people who have
apple<00:01:18.600> products<00:01:19.049> will<00:01:19.350> buy<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.580> one

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
apple products will buy this the one

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
apple products will buy this the one
small<00:01:21.030> drawback<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
small drawback here is that because this

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
small drawback here is that because this
is<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> little<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:23.759> larger<00:01:24.030> keyboard<00:01:24.540> than<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
is a little bit larger keyboard than the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.230 
is a little bit larger keyboard than the
Apple<00:01:25.950> keyboard<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.460> isn't<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
Apple keyboard it isn't one that you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
Apple keyboard it isn't one that you
probably<00:01:27.540> carry<00:01:27.900> around<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.829> lot<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
probably carry around with you a lot of

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
probably carry around with you a lot of
people<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> carry<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
people do like to carry around that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
people do like to carry around that
Apple<00:01:30.930> keyboard<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.890> them<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.759> one's<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
Apple keyboard with them this one's just

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
Apple keyboard with them this one's just
a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.509> bit<00:01:33.630> bigger<00:01:33.810> doesn't<00:01:34.140> fit<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.619> your

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
a little bit bigger doesn't fit in your

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
a little bit bigger doesn't fit in your
bag<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.250> well<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.479> bit<00:01:36.570> heavier<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
bag as well it's a little bit heavier so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.990 
bag as well it's a little bit heavier so
this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.250> keyboard<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.820> most

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this is really a keyboard that's most

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.780 
this is really a keyboard that's most
likely<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.450> sit<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.869> home<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.560> office<00:01:40.790> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
likely to sit in a home or office and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
likely to sit in a home or office and
it's<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.060> nice<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.750> multiple

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it's really nice if you have multiple

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.980 
it's really nice if you have multiple
Apple<00:01:44.189> products<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.210> say<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.540> iMac

and a laptop you could switch seamlessly

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
and a laptop you could switch seamlessly
between<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.079> two<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.740> keyboard<00:01:49.979> you
