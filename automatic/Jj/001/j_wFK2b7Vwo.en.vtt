advanced GPU that's the I think it's the

we<00:01:22.350> should<00:01:22.530> expect<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.070> general<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we should expect in general a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
we should expect in general a
performance<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.570> close<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> an

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
performance that's very close to an

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
performance that's very close to an
NVIDIA<00:01:25.439> Tegra<00:01:25.500> 2<00:01:25.860> maybe<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.119> we're<00:01:27.240> looking

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
NVIDIA Tegra 2 maybe when we're looking

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
NVIDIA Tegra 2 maybe when we're looking
at<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> overall<00:01:27.869> graphic<00:01:28.290> performance

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
at the overall graphic performance

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
at the overall graphic performance
it<00:01:29.729> might<00:01:29.939> even<00:01:30.119> compete<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> Tegra<00:01:31.320> 2

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it might even compete with the Tegra 2

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.890 
it might even compete with the Tegra 2
system<00:01:32.130> can't<00:01:32.850> tell<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.119> anything<00:01:33.329> about<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
system can't tell you anything about the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.460 
system can't tell you anything about the
battery<00:01:34.170> life<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.770> far<00:01:35.900> let's<00:01:36.900> take<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> quick

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
battery life so far let's take a quick

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870 
battery life so far let's take a quick
look<00:01:37.619> around<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.040> system<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.759> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
look around the system so we have a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
look around the system so we have a
volume<00:01:39.119> control<00:01:39.240> over<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.320> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
volume control over here actually this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.649 
volume control over here actually this
is<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> unibody<00:01:41.430> aluminum<00:01:42.030> unibody<00:01:42.210> is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
is a unibody aluminum unibody is

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.219 
is a unibody aluminum unibody is
something<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.799> already<00:01:44.899> pretty<00:01:45.899> cool

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
something that was already pretty cool

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.190 
something that was already pretty cool
on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> HTC<00:01:47.040> legend<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.600> just

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
platform cortex a8 from arm so it's a

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.460 
platform cortex a8 from arm so it's a
little<00:02:18.370> bit<00:02:18.549> wider<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.629> it's<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.230> way

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
little bit wider but it's it's way

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.380 
little bit wider but it's it's way
smaller<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:21.099> kind<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.400> reminds<00:02:21.879> me<00:02:21.909> of<00:02:22.180> its

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
smaller it kind of reminds me of its

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.690 
smaller it kind of reminds me of its
shape<00:02:22.659> with<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.019> carved<00:02:23.409> sides<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:24.099> little<00:02:24.549> bit

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
shape with the carved sides a little bit

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.280 
shape with the carved sides a little bit
like<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.060> first<00:02:25.269> generation<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.079> Apple

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
like the first generation of the Apple

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.800 
like the first generation of the Apple
iPad<00:02:27.299> that's<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.599> very<00:02:28.840> light<00:02:30.569> let's<00:02:31.569> say<00:02:31.780> I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
iPad that's it's very light let's say I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470 
iPad that's it's very light let's say I
would<00:02:31.930> guess<00:02:32.140> around<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.159> same<00:02:33.400> weight<00:02:34.180> as

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
would guess around the same weight as

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.559 
would guess around the same weight as
the<00:02:34.720> Galaxy<00:02:35.140> Tab<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.799> 390<00:02:36.489> grams

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
the Galaxy Tab that is like 390 grams

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.800 
the Galaxy Tab that is like 390 grams
right<00:02:37.569> around<00:02:37.870> 400<00:02:38.409> grams<00:02:39.390> yeah<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.599> again

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
right around 400 grams yeah and again

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.080 
right around 400 grams yeah and again
Gingerbread<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:42.069> won't<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.370> any<00:02:42.549> updates

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
Gingerbread there won't be any updates

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.410

so<00:02:43.390> far<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.900> as<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.620> for<00:02:45.420> for

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
so far that I as I know for for

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.080 
so far that I as I know for for
honeycombed<00:02:46.930> but<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.739> also<00:02:47.920> comes<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.730> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
honeycombed but it also comes with a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.550 
honeycombed but it also comes with a
stylus<00:02:49.450> because<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.079> is<00:02:50.200> an<00:02:50.290> active

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
stylus because this is an active

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.580 
stylus because this is an active
digitizer<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.760> pressure-sensitive<00:02:52.590> display

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
digitizer a pressure-sensitive display

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.580 
digitizer a pressure-sensitive display
so<00:02:54.579> for<00:02:54.849> those<00:02:55.209> guys<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.840> want<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.109> do<00:02:56.230> some

so for those guys that I want to do some

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.770 
so for those guys that I want to do some
notes<00:02:56.829> so<00:02:57.159> you<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.519> see<00:02:57.790> as<00:02:58.000> soon<00:02:58.030> as<00:02:58.269> he<00:02:58.389> using

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
notes so you can see as soon as he using

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780 
notes so you can see as soon as he using
the<00:02:58.810> stylus<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.590> automatically<00:03:00.280> switches<00:03:00.489> all

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the stylus it automatically switches all

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.580 
the stylus it automatically switches all
word<00:03:00.940> into<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.450> scribble<00:03:01.810> application<00:03:02.409> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
word into the scribble application and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430 
word into the scribble application and
then<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.159> can<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.629> draw<00:03:04.629> on<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.079> screen

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
then you can just draw on the screen

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.500 
then you can just draw on the screen
let's<00:03:06.250> take<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.519> quick<00:03:06.819> look<00:03:07.000> if<00:03:07.180> there's<00:03:07.420> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
let's take a quick look if there's a

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.319 
let's take a quick look if there's a
palm<00:03:09.060> recognization<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.629> works<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.849> that's

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
palm recognization that works so that's

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.930 
palm recognization that works so that's
really<00:03:13.510> cool<00:03:13.870> for<00:03:14.019> taking<00:03:14.379> notes<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.940> should

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
really cool for taking notes and should

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.250 
really cool for taking notes and should
be<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.930> way<00:03:17.109> or<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:19.120> concept<00:03:19.510> turns<00:03:19.989> out

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
be in the way or this concept turns out

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.530 
be in the way or this concept turns out
more<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.709> competitor<00:03:21.400> for<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:21.669> SOC<00:03:22.150> Pat

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
more like a competitor for the SOC Pat

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.659 
more like a competitor for the SOC Pat
