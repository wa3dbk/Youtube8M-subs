hey guys welcome to the racing scene I'm
reading<00:00:06.029> I'm<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.600> samurai<00:00:07.230> cincy<00:00:07.859> we're<00:00:08.099> doing

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.160 
reading I'm a samurai cincy we're doing
a<00:00:08.370> mini<00:00:08.519> episode<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> hub<00:00:09.540> centric<00:00:09.870> rinse

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
a mini episode on the hub centric rinse

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:26.279 
a mini episode on the hub centric rinse
and<00:00:10.440> hop<00:00:10.650> centric<00:00:11.099> spaces

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.839 

but<00:00:27.289> today<00:00:27.590> in<00:00:27.740> this<00:00:27.830> mini<00:00:28.099> episode<00:00:28.550> we're

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
but today in this mini episode we're

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.429 
but today in this mini episode we're
going<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.090> put<00:00:29.240> on<00:00:29.359> some<00:00:29.390> hub<00:00:29.750> centric<00:00:30.109> rings

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
going to put on some hub centric rings

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.380 
going to put on some hub centric rings
so<00:00:30.949> our<00:00:31.130> wheels<00:00:31.369> are<00:00:31.669> centered<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.180> their

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
so our wheels are centered on their

00:00:32.390 --> 00:01:07.510 
so our wheels are centered on their
heart

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.800 

so<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.120> goes<00:01:09.270> around<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> hub

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so as you can see it goes around the hub

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.210 
so as you can see it goes around the hub
Center<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> fits<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.930> ring<00:01:13.800> already<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
Center it fits in to the ring already on

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030 
Center it fits in to the ring already on
the<00:01:14.340> hub<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.080> extend<00:01:16.080> sort<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.530> makes<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the hub and extend sort of makes it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.670 
the hub and extend sort of makes it
larger<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.760> fit<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> diameter<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.260> inside

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
larger to fit the diameter of the inside

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:50.580 
larger to fit the diameter of the inside
of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.369> rim<00:01:20.610> where<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.240> meets<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.720> hub

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.990 

bad<00:01:51.590> guys<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.220> there's<00:01:52.340> some<00:01:52.520> reasons<00:01:52.700> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
bad guys and there's some reasons you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.670 
bad guys and there's some reasons you
should<00:01:53.180> run<00:01:53.390> hub<00:01:53.750> centric<00:01:54.050> rings<00:01:54.350> on

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
should run hub centric rings on

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.140 
should run hub centric rings on
aftermarket<00:01:55.520> rims

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
aftermarket rims

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.290 
aftermarket rims
so<00:01:57.110> basically<00:01:57.560> aftermarket<00:01:58.430> rims<00:01:58.610> have<00:01:58.970> a

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
so basically aftermarket rims have a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.140 
so basically aftermarket rims have a
much<00:01:59.720> larger<00:01:59.990> center<00:02:00.560> bore<00:02:00.740> than<00:02:01.580> you<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
much larger center bore than you the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.730 
much larger center bore than you the
typical<00:02:02.480> hub<00:02:02.660> size<00:02:02.900> this<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:03.620> they

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
typical hub size this is so they

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.890 
typical hub size this is so they
correlate<00:02:04.100> all<00:02:04.310> various<00:02:04.700> makes<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.180> models

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
correlate all various makes and models

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.070 
correlate all various makes and models
which<00:02:06.500> have<00:02:06.530> different<00:02:06.770> size<00:02:07.100> homes<00:02:07.780> now<00:02:08.780> what

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
which have different size homes now what

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.200 
which have different size homes now what
a<00:02:09.320> hub<00:02:09.590> centric<00:02:09.950> ring<00:02:10.100> does<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.850> fills<00:02:11.090> the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
a hub centric ring does is it fills the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.070 
a hub centric ring does is it fills the
gap<00:02:11.420> between<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:13.400> hub<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.910> center<00:02:14.840> bore<00:02:14.990> of

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
gap between the hub and center bore of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.200 
gap between the hub and center bore of
the<00:02:15.110> rim<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.250> basically<00:02:16.610> when<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.850> install

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
the rim so basically when you install

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.340 
the rim so basically when you install
the<00:02:17.270> wheel<00:02:17.450> that's<00:02:17.600> guaranteed<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:18.320> a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
the wheel that's guaranteed to be a

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.610 
the wheel that's guaranteed to be a
hundred<00:02:18.560> percent<00:02:18.680> spot<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.570> yeah<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.260> that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
hundred percent spot on yeah and so that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.220 
hundred percent spot on yeah and so that
gets<00:02:21.800> speed<00:02:22.220> wobbles<00:02:22.730> which<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.720> cause<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
gets speed wobbles which can cause to

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.000 
gets speed wobbles which can cause to
hub<00:02:24.740> damage<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.700> know<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.500> rim<00:02:27.500> buckling

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
hub damage you know and rim buckling

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.040 
hub damage you know and rim buckling
that<00:02:28.280> sort<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.580> thing<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.630> make<00:02:29.810> sure

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
that sort of thing so just make sure

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.900 
that sort of thing so just make sure
when<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.380> when<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> put<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> rim<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.550> every

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
when you when you put the rim on every

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.210 
when you when you put the rim on every
single<00:02:32.210> time<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:33.020> centered<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> hub<00:02:33.890> so

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
single time it's centered on the hub so

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.650 
single time it's centered on the hub so
it<00:02:34.340> can't<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.610> unbalanced<00:02:35.210> or<00:02:35.300> anything<00:02:35.450> like

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
it can't be unbalanced or anything like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.000 
it can't be unbalanced or anything like
that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
that
there's<00:02:37.880> other<00:02:38.090> things<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.510> come<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.690> hub

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
there's other things that come with hub

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.150 
there's other things that come with hub
centric<00:02:39.770> rings<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:41.020> your<00:02:42.020> spacers<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.890> can

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
centric rings so your spacers you can

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.530 
centric rings so your spacers you can
get<00:02:43.280> them<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:43.580> hub<00:02:43.730> centric<00:02:44.030> rings<00:02:44.330> as<00:02:44.510> well

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
get them with hub centric rings as well

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.570 
get them with hub centric rings as well
pretty<00:02:45.470> much<00:02:45.590> anything<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.160> goes<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.430> your

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
pretty much anything that goes on your

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.070 
pretty much anything that goes on your
hub<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.030> important<00:02:47.480> for<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.720> be<00:02:47.780> hub

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
hub it's important for it to be hub

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.760 
hub it's important for it to be hub
centric<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.160> when<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.700> goes<00:02:49.850> on<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.300> doesn't

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
centric so when it goes on it doesn't

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.100 
centric so when it goes on it doesn't
wobble<00:02:51.770> or<00:02:52.220> anything<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.700> that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
wobble or anything like that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.440 
wobble or anything like that
I<00:02:54.110> was<00:02:54.590> your<00:02:54.950> course<00:02:55.190> damage<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.670> your<00:02:55.730> car<00:02:55.940> so

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
I was your course damage to your car so
