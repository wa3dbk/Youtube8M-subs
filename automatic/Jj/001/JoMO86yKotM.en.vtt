of it we analyzed the contents and the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.859 
of it we analyzed the contents and the
structure<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:04.500> seems<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.340> easy<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.720> do

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
structure it seems like it's easy to do

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.900 
structure it seems like it's easy to do
but<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.410> really<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.340> requires<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but it's really not and it requires a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.510 
but it's really not and it requires a
lot<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.240> this<00:02:09.840> complicated<00:02:10.440> instruments<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
lot of this complicated instruments and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.810 
lot of this complicated instruments and
equipment<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.780> do<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.980> essentially<00:02:14.490> we

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
equipment to do it so essentially we

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.400 
equipment to do it so essentially we
have<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> lot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.150> fun<00:02:15.450> playing<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.870> chemical

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
have a lot of fun playing with chemical

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.880

actually care about you for me what
makes<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.640> Hell<00:03:17.819> different<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.540> its<00:03:19.260> small

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
makes you in Hell different is its small

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.850 
makes you in Hell different is its small
size<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.970> said<00:03:21.540> before<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.500> gives

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
size like I said before like and gives

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.160 
size like I said before like and gives
you<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.160> sense<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.880> family<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.930> community

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and so it actually makes it easier for

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.820 
and so it actually makes it easier for
me<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:30.030> here<00:03:30.110> because<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.319> lot<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.680> people
