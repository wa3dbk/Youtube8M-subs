so<00:04:02.500> we<00:04:02.560> want<00:04:02.739> them<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.010> hang<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.430> correct

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
so we want them to hang in the correct

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.690 
so we want them to hang in the correct

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
way so we'll just punch that out now we

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.070 
way so we'll just punch that out now we
have<00:04:09.850> all<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> our<00:04:10.180> ribbon<00:04:10.540> cut<00:04:10.780> which<00:04:10.930> is

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
have all of our ribbon cut which is

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.740 
have all of our ribbon cut which is
great<00:04:11.380> but<00:04:11.560> first<00:04:12.070> let's<00:04:13.000> stuff<00:04:13.390> this<00:04:13.540> with

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
great but first let's stuff this with

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.170 
great but first let's stuff this with
our<00:04:13.870> little<00:04:14.080> notes<00:04:14.410> here<00:04:17.790> make<00:04:18.790> sure<00:04:18.820> it's

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
our little notes here make sure it's

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.460 
our little notes here make sure it's
nice<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.600> secure<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.470> kids<00:04:20.680> don't<00:04:20.890> peek

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
nice and secure so the kids don't peek

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.810 
nice and secure so the kids don't peek
and<00:04:23.470> then<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.890> helps<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.250> cut<00:04:24.400> these<00:04:24.550> on<00:04:24.669> an

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
and then it helps to cut these on an

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.010 
and then it helps to cut these on an
angle<00:04:25.120> too<00:04:25.300> especially<00:04:25.510> when<00:04:25.900> you're

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
angle too especially when you're

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.210 
angle too especially when you're
sticking<00:04:26.320> them<00:04:26.530> through<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> little<00:04:26.979> holes

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
sticking them through the little holes

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.969 
sticking them through the little holes
like<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.640> but<00:04:27.910> we're<00:04:28.690> just<00:04:28.840> gonna<00:04:28.990> thread<00:04:29.860> it

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
like this but we're just gonna thread it

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.890 
like this but we're just gonna thread it
through<00:04:30.160> there<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.610> can<00:04:34.330> paper<00:04:34.570> Mart<00:04:34.840> we

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
through there so I can paper Mart we

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.420 
through there so I can paper Mart we
have<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.229> many<00:04:35.350> different<00:04:35.530> kinds<00:04:35.950> of<00:04:36.010> ribbons

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
have so many different kinds of ribbons

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.760 
have so many different kinds of ribbons
colors<00:04:37.120> patterns<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.080> choose<00:04:38.470> from

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
colors patterns that you can choose from

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.740 
colors patterns that you can choose from
so<00:04:39.400> really<00:04:39.669> just<00:04:39.700> depends<00:04:40.180> on<00:04:40.240> what<00:04:40.540> you're<00:04:40.660> in

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
so really just depends on what you're in

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.420 
so really just depends on what you're in
the<00:04:40.780> mood<00:04:40.960> for<00:04:41.020> how<00:04:41.770> you're<00:04:41.950> decorating<00:04:42.070> for

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the mood for how you're decorating for

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.880

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
the holidays we're using them again the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.340 
the holidays we're using them again the
Holly<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.220> twig<00:04:45.520> for<00:04:45.760> these<00:04:45.940> purposes<00:04:46.479> okay

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
Holly and twig for these purposes okay

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.800 
Holly and twig for these purposes okay
let's<00:04:47.979> see<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.610> best<00:04:48.790> way<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.060> secure<00:04:49.600> these

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
let's see the best way to secure these

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.590 
let's see the best way to secure these
then<00:04:50.169> on<00:04:50.380> here<00:04:51.180> we're<00:04:52.180> gonna<00:04:52.270> put<00:04:52.510> another

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
then on here we're gonna put another

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.320 
then on here we're gonna put another
little<00:04:52.960> glue<00:04:53.290> dot<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.880> we<00:04:54.970> want<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.210> easy

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
little glue dot so we want it easy

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.940 
little glue dot so we want it easy
enough<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:56.380> pull<00:04:56.650> down<00:04:56.950> for<00:04:57.850> each<00:04:57.970> day<00:04:58.950> so

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
enough to to pull down for each day so

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.880 
enough to to pull down for each day so
shouldn't<00:05:00.669> be<00:05:00.880> too<00:05:01.240> tight<00:05:01.510> on<00:05:01.690> here<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.620> then

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
shouldn't be too tight on here and then

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.680 
shouldn't be too tight on here and then
we'll<00:05:03.100> start<00:05:03.460> on<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.640> far<00:05:03.880> side<00:05:04.180> over<00:05:04.210> here

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
we'll start on the far side over here

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.999 
we'll start on the far side over here
with<00:05:04.870> our<00:05:04.990> first<00:05:05.200> one<00:05:05.530> just<00:05:08.370> tape<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.520> over

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.529 

well<00:05:13.009> space<00:05:13.310> these<00:05:13.580> out<00:05:13.759> when<00:05:13.970> we<00:05:14.090> put<00:05:14.300> more<00:05:14.479> on

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
well space these out when we put more on

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.360 
well space these out when we put more on
here<00:05:14.960> but<00:05:15.199> I<00:05:15.440> think<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.860> get<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.130> general

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
here but I think you get the general

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.300 
here but I think you get the general
idea<00:05:16.729> so<00:05:17.539> we<00:05:17.630> have<00:05:17.720> our<00:05:17.840> first<00:05:18.050> first<00:05:18.860> day<00:05:19.160> of

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
idea so we have our first first day of

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.070 
idea so we have our first first day of
the<00:05:19.490> month<00:05:19.850> right<00:05:20.030> there<00:05:20.389> and<00:05:20.930> we'll<00:05:21.050> just
