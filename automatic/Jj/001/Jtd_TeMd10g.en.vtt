00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.090
 at 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.540
 but 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:34.190
 we're not going to turn around the pot I 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:36.350
 get on board this rocket you go 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.280
 stay here and protect the cortex up 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.570
 what the army is fully loaded 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 I'm sorry that ends like this 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.530
 I wish I had another solution 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.260
 but nobody else in the slightest 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.000
 chance facing the ancestors 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.859
 glad to see that you have chosen 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.480
 your camp doctor I'm going to open this 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.930
 door 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.930
 it's useless 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.350
 elio the guys epic breath i hope 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.540
 that you are well we end up 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.710
 today for the end of exodus everything 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.930
 just so it's a spoil video 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.700
 if you do not want to be spoiled well 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.020
 I invite you to go see others 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.760
 rather than I did on this map or 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 just go play on this card 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.750
 so do not watch the video 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.090
 so so frankly this map I 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.200
 found quite simple clearly except or to 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.060
 moments it's really a mess 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.070
 but at three it's easy to survive 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.940
 I found it quite simple where is this 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.890
 that they were the ones who had 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.380
 almost but almost all types 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.750
 of creepers except the plants vs. zombies 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.540
 as I call them field is 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.100
 that's it for those who throw in companion 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.259
 accompanied by superb here is a 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 idea of zecs and one of his super friends 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.560
 ninja so here we managed the map 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.610
 it was really very very simple I 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.130
 give you some tips 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.110
 well there succeed is that already the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.700
 players and still special tears that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.530
 can be very effective when it is 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 brothel or if you should not take it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.030
 not they take and grenade mx1 so 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.070
 when we started bagdad at the launched turn 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.989
 a grenade mx1 your feet that kills this 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.400
 that there is around 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.780
 so that's it then you're stuck in 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.459
 the spawn once you have activated 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.660
 the six generators it seems to me that 1 to 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.950
 6 must return to the spawn is activated 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.030
 I think it's not the vortex so 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.489
 something like that every day 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.019
 tap on it basically then you have 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.489
 ancestors who will arrive a tonnage 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.010
 which must fill up then the aliens do not 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.060
 can not destroy this this object that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.590
 you activate because I do not smoke anymore 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.360
 at all of the name that's what you have 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.850
 brought back to the end of hawking so wheels and 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.220
 so here are the allies does not inflict any 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.750
 damage to this brothel but against you 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.730
 have ancestors who revives you can 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.350
 to have as saic had two of us at 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.610
 the end we had a kia arises this is the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.200
 fourth did not even need the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.840
 kill 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.670
 so that's what it depends on your 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.940
 time you put to killing aliens 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.130
 that's how I think the vortex it 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.620
 seems to me to be filling up so to you 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.180
 give some tips to kill 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.380
 easily the years is simply to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.360
 you really get to know them 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.530
 body and remove it at their level 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.670
 head here if you put to body to 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.900
 body in their heads it can be 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.000
 really deadly it's their done 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.170
 damn police damage behind fo 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.170
 black hole and shield 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.340
 it can also be fatal to you 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.100
 sent a black hole in your mouth and you 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.890
 you move away you hide yourself next 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.660
 I recommend the vulture and not the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.920
 turret the little by little they get 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.650
 destroyed really easily given 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.760
 that there is a big big number of aliens 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.200
 especially that your towers can 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.180
 improve it since the update you 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.290
 even if it's literally scammed 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.459
 the points they put for the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 vulture that last longer 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.870
 secret 50 points it's expensive so voila 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.459
 what was it about all that I 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.810
 will tell you with amap so I will 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.570
 leave with a bit of gameplay and with 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.670
 hungry drivers so I have not too much 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.019
 honestly we understand that 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.250
 burst yourself on this map do not hesitate 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.420
 to subscribe if it's not already done 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.930
 I read to you recognition dedicated to the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.930
 next decade 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:13.849
 history repeats itself a species 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.529
 disappears 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.529
 and our just takes his place 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.120
 so many lives sacrificed for survival 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.920
 of a few privileged people that 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.410
 we could make the difference between 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.410
 survival and extensions
