00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
hours of RF what is the radio frequency
antennas<00:03:00.139> so<00:03:01.139> I<00:03:01.410> embed<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.549> chip<00:03:03.109> this<00:03:04.109> whole

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
antennas so I embed this chip this whole

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.430 
antennas so I embed this chip this whole
thing<00:03:04.560> into<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.280> card<00:03:06.060> when<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.840> embed<00:03:07.200> this

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
thing into the card when I embed this

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.910 
thing into the card when I embed this
this<00:03:08.130> looks<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.609> somewhat<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.329> this

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
this looks like somewhat like this

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.240 
this looks like somewhat like this
so<00:03:11.520> now<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.510> becomes<00:03:12.690> more<00:03:13.110> secure<00:03:13.500> now

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so now it becomes more secure now

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.420 
so now it becomes more secure now
whenever<00:03:14.490> we<00:03:14.730> go<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.209> an<00:03:15.510> ATM<00:03:15.840> machine<00:03:16.250> we<00:03:17.250> need

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
whenever we go to an ATM machine we need

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.270 
whenever we go to an ATM machine we need
to<00:03:17.580> just<00:03:17.760> show<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.270> card<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> tape<00:03:18.959> machine

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
to just show this card to a tape machine

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.449 
to just show this card to a tape machine
in<00:03:20.280> front<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.700> pin<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:22.980> more<00:03:23.130> secure

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
in front of pin and this is more secure

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.660 
in front of pin and this is more secure
now<00:03:23.610> why<00:03:23.940> does<00:03:24.150> secure<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:26.370> chip

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
now why does secure because this chip

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.790 
now why does secure because this chip
has<00:03:26.970> encrypted<00:03:27.750> data<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.140> yourself

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
has encrypted data of yourself

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.770 
has encrypted data of yourself

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
they can know from this is the validity

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.199 
they can know from this is the validity
