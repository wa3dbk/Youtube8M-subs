00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:19.050
 so welcome to the tests today 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.689
 with the giga byte m 6903 1500 gb the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.830
 optical sensor and seven buttons for 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 program and direct operating 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:34.050
 I have the version 2 appear that they 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 top of you v2 the packaging was the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.219
 small and big and out of the packaging 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 you wanted this plastic box over 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 I am a little surprised 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.020
 pretty cool that you get so 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.160
 pub came or by robert hoyzer one has 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.590
 machines are not always around 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 6,900 gigabytes 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.199
 here are still packing with the lid 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 and see the beautiful embedded here 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:12.960
 the mouse we we watch what they still so 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 nice and have a cable completely 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.509
 exactly 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.409
 more is not in this constitution 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.689
 know 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:30.659
 there is no registration no 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:33.509
 warranty no cd nothing but how 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.729
 a boss at the computer screen we go 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.070
 first on the cable one is normal 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.460
 but relatively normal is usb cable it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.470
 but already wasted for a long time 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.729
 but think if you gilded hardly 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.869
 then the transfer can be 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.590
 fast and point a high speed hdmi 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.130
 1.4 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.510
 100 euro has him cold on the we 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.570
 have a kind gumming and also here 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.700
 the side too and nothing special we 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.340
 have no weights at some can 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.670
 I very easily break the mouse 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.990
 have our lies very well in hand 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.810
 you have to say that thumb the thumb 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.380
 really nice even in this handle 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.150
 line 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.100
 that's really good and he is not 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.240
 index finger is really good in here 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.530
 and she's really good on me 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:38.090
 have the mouse the first unpack he 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.860
 marveled at and then of course at 22 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.820
 euro this is not a problem or you 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.280
 Do not do too much of that right now 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
 expect quality or has jochen maas 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.220
 I really need to get started with moss 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.720
 say 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.190
 but still I always have to say that 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.620
 action I hope you hear is 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.610
 is rattling in the mouse is not 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 really everything is really what I am 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.610
 have read many reviews and many 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.290
 have ever written 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.520
 even the key I'll have next 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.540
 What your products are not getting 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.680
 beautiful 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.780
 version 2 but you can see the button 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.180
 Klapphandy here too and it does not work 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.600
 very stable that really little joy 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.890
 you will not have a lot with it 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.070
 rating, of course, happy if you have time 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.560
 read 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.450
 how many reviews were viewed and 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.360
 opinions from users firmiert with good 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.660
 Of course I have free from 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.720
 This should be the mouse four weeks 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.280
 and then I have to find it from the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.770
 Men do not work as well as they do 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.459
 was often rated 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.600
 we have the area management here 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.800
 down kennedy was once a 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.160
 we also see that they have 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.510
 lights here can subsequently make 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.920
 could we down the one will 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.290
 Computer always recognized immediately 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.290
 That's why I have to say I like it better 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.890
 fixed many did not have to so much 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:13.970
 It's also nice when we see it 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:17.930
 here are optical sensor 3100 can 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:26.080
 Now look how it works 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:29.090
 also a premiere i can go to 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.070
 compare pack and a bit 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.900
 size compares to something bigger 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.270
 the gigabit nas 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.160
 you can tell that it is longer and 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.690
 also a bit higher but that higher 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.440
 minimal but you can tell it already 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.030
 also notice that here 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.260
 It's happening quickly 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.600
 at much used wear only mothers 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.070
 quickly realize that it arrives directly 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.200
 many do not even know that 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.640
 has one year and that will be here 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 be one hundred percent the case 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.070
 you can see the savior is already him 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.510
 informed surface and thus becomes 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.010
 you certainly have to follow longer costs 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.340
 but also a bit more then 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:13.000
 price is the days again the orca 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:15.890
 introduce cdu and the razer deathadder 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.710
 and then let's see and the 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.590
 to compare a bit 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.450
 for beginners price from 19 to 20 euros 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.860
 yes we do not try a lot of users 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.840
 you like to gamble on the evening 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.760
 But do not want twelve hours duration 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.310
 I would do gaming or something like that 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.500
 They do not necessarily recommend it but like that 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.890
 she has many people in between 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.390
 a beautiful plant when I saw the audience 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.370
 drinne my hand is not like that 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.900
 bombastic big and I have to say that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.300
 still get on very well and 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.270
 have led mode of war and for it 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.130
 I would recommend for less 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.169
 but it takes time to correct users 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.610
 because you as a gaming mouse too 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.130
 I would cut her out a bit 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.789
 absolutely recommend me and that was it 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.520
 better again 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:06.800
 tests if questions on him to mine 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.599
 evaluate head wear communicate 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.669
 I hope you could not go home 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:15.669
 win the gigabyte 6900
