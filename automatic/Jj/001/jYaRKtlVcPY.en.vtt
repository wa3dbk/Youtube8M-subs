00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:05.600
 So now you can do it all over again with special blood type tests 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.229
 look in detail 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.979
 and such tests earlier date and today is the May the test must be after 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.320
 the guidelines of the German Medical Association 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.880
 each directly before blood transfusions 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.980
 be performed with patient and donor material 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 to test again which blood type in the donor and the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.679
 Recipient is present 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.270
 that is so important 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.110
 because will be 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.860
 Antibodies come together with the corresponding antigen, it comes to a 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.380
 Blood clumping 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.280
 a blood clumping can then lead to blockages in blood vessels 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.659
 so-called embolisms 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.439
 and these embolisms then take care of certain areas of the body 

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.399
 can not be supplied with blood and that can 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.140
 of course life threatening 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 go out 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.280
 yes in the test you can see these clumping places here 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 where to have this little Weissenau 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.049
 Brightening comes here in contrast to the areas 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.049
 where it just stays all red and train a clumping 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.770
 yes, you can do that very well now 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 Alarm when we look at the Maidult for example 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.300
 then we have a test field here 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.909
 on the tree of different or all four blood groups 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.539
 just material is already applied and now you are more likely to ETR counted and 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.700
 Look at where it comes to clumping and where 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 let's assume 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.149
 we have the first field here 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.259
 that means evenings have material from blood group a 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.479
 on the test strip 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.080
 and now we're giving area-defiant ones 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.340
 are the Eric Strutz beware of a stand with the blood type a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.090
 that does not come to a clumping 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.220
 if they are from a stand with the blood group b then it comes to a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.149
 clumping 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.750
 because he has 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 in the place of honor Siri multiple units the anti go around like him and that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 there is now a reaction with the antibodies against b 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.809
 from serum of blood groups a 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.430
 Give as Retro Ziethen the blood group a Rapid to have so beside the 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:22.449
 Antigen Araya also the antigen b on the Aerox references and that's how it is here too 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.129
 to a clumping 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.119
 as we have already seen it is so 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.930
 if we 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.660
 Adding the blood of van de Rieth benefits of blood type 0 never happens 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.780
 to a clumping because on this her sorry year none 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.700
 Antigens on it so that it can never come to a reaction with antibodies 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.959
 yes, if the blood group b is present at the recipient then sees something 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.669
 different for now comes s 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.529
 Add to a clumping NWRI despite guarding with the Kita 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.849
 not to a clump if the retro aimed with the insight into the 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.479
 to give everyone 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.879
 GbR retrofit with suspicion b 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.879
 then, of course, it comes again to a clumping 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.409
 yes, we can see that here with the blood type Art b 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.469
 it does not give a clump NWRI despite fetters 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.269
 because the blood group a Day has no antibodies in the plasma 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.010
 So no matter which development steps do not exist 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.160
 regardless of what antigens they are 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.939
 carry 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.290
 it never comes to one 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.499
 clumping 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.539
 the blood group zero on the other hand 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.010
 have in the classification at Eder antibodies 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.540
 that does not matter which their criticism does not give if they 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.860
 Antigen also go brother antigen b or carry at the antigens 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.950
 it comes in each case a clumping 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.719
 and only if I end up with 0 despite sending the pop group 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
 da Nang there is no clumping 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.860
 The same can be done at Minor Test now 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.829
 with the very and Dave doing 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.150
 that is also here we have again a test field with blood of different 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.040
 blood Types 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.299
 thereon 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.709
 There is now "a lot to do and then look where it comes to clump 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.229
 here is just interesting 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.710
 if you have the blood type zero 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.100
 then test whatever given again 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.390
 because the blood group zero has no antibodies on the their reviews 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.450
 antigens 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.730
 that does not matter 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.390
 whether in serum to the Arand idea 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.850
 or Anti around and the Bee are present there is no clumping 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.760
 if we have the blood group from b 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.860
 then they test 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.569
 No matter what serum given if antibodies are present in the serum 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.349
 that comes in one place 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.090
 clumping 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.740
 yes there is still the so-called bed shows he is 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.710
 that is now 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.120
 Kurt Staska you can do 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.439
 there have the fields 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.150
 get up different antibodies 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.250
 available 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.800
 and now we're adding the blood from a patient and if we for example 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.080
 have a field to stand up antibodies against the antigen ORF are present and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.889
 it comes to a clumping 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.710
 with that the person has to 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.669
 at least have blood group a 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.120
 if it 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.120
 on the field where the antibodies are against b 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.960
 Train a clumping comes 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.520
 then that means 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.360
 on the blood cells sits the anti go but not the antigen de 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.030
 that means we actually have 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.419
 the blood group a 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.410
 and not the blood group a to b 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.780
 because then it would have so both the antibodies AR and the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.180
 Antibodies b come to a clumping 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.560
 In addition, the Resources topics are already being tested here, that is to say 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.010
 on 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.789
 a field 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.929
 with antibodies against the rhesus factor so-called 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.190
 Antic go 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.030
 and if it comes to a clumping then that means that the person 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.000
 antibody 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.349
 against the de 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.389
 that the person de antigens de 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.309
 Blood has carried on the wedding ring Ziethen has 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:08.419
 it comes here to a clumping that is this person is now rhesus 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.440
 positive she suffered despite the teaching 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.469
 the resource and i go 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.469
 rest 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.569
 That's just a quick look at the distribution of Marc's blood types 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.370
 Gianola system and in it we see this by two blood groups clearly 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.800
 Namely, on the one hand, the blood group Knoll exceeded 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.009
 with 42 percent 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.790
 and the other the blood group a with 44 percent the two together so 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.550
 the lion's share 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.350
 out 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.940
 if we then take the Resources topics with it 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.889
 then there is 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:48.860
 there again 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.680
 2 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.259
 because the blood type is the biggest part program 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.080
 with 34 percent 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.119
 but positive so with a band the area against 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.399
 when they go to her with the rhesus 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.449
 and the blood group zero 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.840
 also with the 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.349
 Rhesus monkeys they go 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.349
 with 38 percent also drive here 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.930
 and 0 make up the lion's share here with the positive response 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.350
 Set up an antigen he advises Rolf South
