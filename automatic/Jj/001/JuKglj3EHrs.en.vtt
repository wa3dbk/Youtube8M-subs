00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 highlight and welcome back 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.059
 on a canal 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.760
 today there is an update to mine 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.300
 routine because that is really requested 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.190
 has been 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.110
 I thought of course, I turn now 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.699
 also 1 and I think there's more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.170
 have nothing to say if you feel like it 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.120
 even such a video then stays on everyone 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 fall to the end and I would 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.409
 just so much fun so people 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.720
 before I take a shower , I would come 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.059
 of course my hair with it later 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.280
 not too knotted and in the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.129
 shower I use a number of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.190
 pantene pro-v here is the shampoo 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.770
 for colored hair then a rinse 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.640
 for protection and volume and then too 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.720
 a cure for color and protect and the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.670
 I do not have any shower for you now 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.240
 shown but after that I use up 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.330
 any case my oil from revlon or that 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.990
 oil from valea which I just fine 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.119
 find 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.649
 and here I took that from barea 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.539
 and that's what I 'm writing on now 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.659
 palms and then I distribute that 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.429
 with both hands evenly in mine 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.040
 hair tips and take care that I 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.840
 do not go too far up because of the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.049
 Otherwise maybe a bit hair 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.579
 look finished 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.579
 then the hair will of course first 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.560
 felt quite normal but I find them 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.469
 just upside down so I one 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.939
 a bit more volume at the beginning and have 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.740
 whatever I do is so individual 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.799
 hold them high and then just then 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.310
 also for more volume here too 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.869
 to get and that really works then 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.180
 I always try the hair 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.909
 fill bit upwards so that they 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.239
 just stay up and what I too 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.600
 sometimes my mom is doing such a thing 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:13.280
 to steal the brush and I use it 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.500
 then also and that's great because 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.239
 she just dries the other completely 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.920
 and the hair at the same time 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.739
 keeps up a bit and get it 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 they also have much more volume and if 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.930
 I'm finished then see my hair like that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 out 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.270
 I feel so up 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.850
 in between blue scene pure always have 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 decides again heavy snowfall 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.900
 will definitely be new to you 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.480
 tell a little bit like mine have 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.820
 Generally, that's me 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.110
 I do not have straight hair and I have 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.610
 do not lure but I have 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.040
 relatively frizzy hair that does not matter 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.480
 however you care for it always will 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.360
 be dry 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.680
 at least look like this because it just as 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.590
 listened to with grisly struck and it is 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.940
 so I do not think so good but me 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.490
 It can not be called, I have too 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.250
 in my last I have deeply done 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.350
 like my infobox something tells why 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.150
 I dyed my hair and it always is 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.310
 still so if you want to know how 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.710
 I do that then looks in any case 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.130
 over I can only say I a 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.850
 she'll break with waves and that 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.820
 it is the color 81 blond 8 and that 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.560
 is just a different and after all 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.030
 Lengths are just a few strands 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.020
 and also my dream of a hair 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.150
 then I also heard sometimes asked 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.830
 with which I wake up my curls and 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 I do that with a curling iron 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.600
 Remington, and I will do that for you 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.940
 exact model in the infobox once 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.450
 link but that's how it looks on everyone 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.200
 fall out and I am very happy 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.560
 in order to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 I 'm really great and I love it 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.489
 just shoutbox on the club if you like 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.770
 be interested in it 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.080
 and then I can show you with 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.330
 which smoothes always work 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.390
 if this is the setting here 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.290
 seven brown and I am really very 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.290
 satisfied with it 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.970
 it does not make it complete yet 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.880
 on straight hair but also one 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.790
 natural smoothness and I like it 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.830
 actually better than when complete 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.270
 flatten under but would have to 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.010
 I decide for everyone 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.870
 think for the whole excitement among you 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.200
 is that she is not strong enough for it 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.750
 the over-indebtedness grab or so however 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.430
 for my have it completely enough and 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.100
 I'm really happy with that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.720
 result and otherwise announce 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.000
 now arrived at the end of this 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.550
 any denigrate i have pretty 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.500
