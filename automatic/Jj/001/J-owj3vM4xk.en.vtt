00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:08.130
 Well now they have laid the eggs 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.390
 the becos can not be 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.390
 and we are going to accept them 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.430
 to put them 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.430
 a player 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.040
 as you will see the female in fact there is a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.970
 little mountain of earth to bury 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.970
 eggs we have to dig them up 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.970
 gently 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 to get them out but 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.210
 here is one 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.680
 previously he has already prepared to see 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.640
 niculite yes 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 to receive them 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.329
 only so that it does not suffer any damage 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.619
 now here we do in the role of the 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.619
 true written two holes 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.640
 two 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.640
 and other 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.310
 and we are currently 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.869
 let's try to keep them in the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.329
 same position where they were 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.650
 yes because blind you are stuck in the 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:54.200
 surface 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.200
 and you can take off and if I hope so 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.500
 we do not treat 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.350
 and the other one I'm harder to take out 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.350
 because it's fair 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.340
 this is simpler is forgiveness is more 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.340
 complex 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.540
 without squeezing because if it would not break very 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.660
 gently you have to catch it 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.770
 and here once he 's buried 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.770
 with this stage 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.370
 with the holes duly made here 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.569
 they have predetermined holes 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.569
 I really do not know anything 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.910
 temperature up to 28 degrees 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.480
 like us to come out 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.300
 females and males even though it is 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.850
 better that females come out because 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.700
 males then fight between 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.730
 and close tightly so that 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.450
 keep the temperature 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.420
 and that's it, that's how the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.030
 eggs, it is convenient to prepare a newspaper 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.050
 day when they have been put and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.240
 placed on it 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.500
 in the incubator so that we can 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.280
 know in how many days we hope to have 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.080
 Exactly cold days are expected by how much 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.750
 time 55 days from about 40 to 60 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.460
 so we make an average of 45 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.120
 and hopefully you liked the video 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.120
 and good bye
