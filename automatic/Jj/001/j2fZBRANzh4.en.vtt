00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
exactly like I imagined based on the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
exactly like I imagined based on the
description<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.480> listing<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> ingredients

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
description and listing of ingredients

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.229 
description and listing of ingredients
like<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.129> cool<00:00:44.340> that's<00:00:44.550> only<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> buck<00:00:45.059> i

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
guess but you'd be better off paying a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
guess but you'd be better off paying a
little<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.230> better<00:00:49.350> nachos<00:00:49.739> for

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
little more for some better nachos for

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
little more for some better nachos for
something<00:00:50.700> better<00:00:50.850> yeah<00:00:51.120> does<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.660> help<00:00:51.809> in

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
something better yeah does that help in
