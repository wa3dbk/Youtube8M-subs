00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.390
 awaited by it has already been prepared and the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.020
 capsule has already been installed near for 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.610
 acrylic 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.970
 you will still use two 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.279
 different colors if you apply 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.739
 pink powder on the white capsule 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.110
 or white it will be more clean 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.840
 shining then applied transparent 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.700
 on the white capsule then pink on 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.570
 the rest of long and you go when 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.100
 even do it by following the three zones 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.100
 take an average drop of transparency 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.150
 and drop it on the white capsule 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.880
 be sure to wipe clean your 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.579
 brush use the tip of the brush 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.369
 to direct it to one side then the tip 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.140
 brush for the other side and then 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.619
 the brush dish could pull towards 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.619
 the end 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.520
 do not worry if there is a shot 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:27.170
 which is better for Elie but that later 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:30.320
 the next road will be roses filed 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.600
 there and follow your brush with 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.490
 lapointe go one side then the other 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.170
 and then is pulled with the brush flat 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.760
 but do not worry if a little 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560
 hard to cover the transparent 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 once you die there and it does not happen 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.190
 will see more for the final tilted drop 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.690
 the finger of your client so that 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.690
 acrylic through cuticles 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.750
 use the tip of your brush to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.750
 to force it is stretched 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.180
 about 60 seconds to 5 in acrylic 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.180
 harden then I'll be able to put 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.920
 the peach tong and the waiting time 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.400
 depends on the room in which you 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.800
 you find 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.710
 this room is rather warm so 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.780
 not a lot of wrongs and if you are 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.300
 in a cooler room you'll have 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.040
 more time for example in competition 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.360
 you're in a big cool room 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.430
 so you have more time in a 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.700
 living room by cons where he does a little more 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.470
 hot 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.470
 you have a lot less time 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.490
 length and must now be fresh if 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.410
 you are unsure supported with 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.570
 fingers to check if it's still a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.720
 little sticky was waiting a little more 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.720
 long time 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.890
 this angle looks ready so let's put 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.780
 rabbits are place where you 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.030
 put the clamp depends on how you 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.560
 want to pinch if you want to spend a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.530
 little bit because it's for a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.480
 customer a living room this is perfect if 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.590
 you want to spend more class and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:32.239
 the nail inside the clip and get 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.070
 follow to do a lot tighter you 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.480
 must leave rabbits are place a few 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.010
 minutes 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.810
 so I recommend you first smart 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.850
 of course you can start the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.390
 next long then the third the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.150
 fourth 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.500
 and it's the clamp needs to stay in 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.959
 long enough place the acrylic in 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.190
 eight hours to fully harden and 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.580
 the first few billion are 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.340
 the most important 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.110
 if you remove the clip too early 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.220
 the nail will resume its shape and you 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.900
 will not have the skin for you wanted it 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.940
 there are valid reasons to use 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.800
 the peach clamp and is a technique 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.760
 to use properly without damaging 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.100
 the natural nail 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.050
 if you wait too much and you place the 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.850
 clip too late you can do 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.040
 a lot of damage by lifting the nail 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.049
 gilles a dude so assured come from the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.919
 do it early enough if it makes any marks 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.650
 in acrylic 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.180
 it does not matter it is better that its 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.930
 mark the acrylic rather than the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.789
 to be too late 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.039
 the second reason why the 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.440
 pinscher it's to support the acrylic 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.150
 on the sides against the English that there 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.030
 have less demarcation on these parts 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.039
 and the third reason and to give a 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.060
 much more natural effect 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.229
 of false nail extensions preventing 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.780
 the nail comes out of the nail bed 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.340
 exactly like a natural nail so 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.139
 it gives the impression that it is an angle 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:05:03.169
 real when long letter and remove the 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:08.240
 bunny pinscher clip that has been in place 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.919
 a few minutes the yard of the pretty and 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.759
 the walls are very straight what will 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.759
 help us image
