guess you know mix it mix it a little
bit<00:01:37.759> more<00:01:37.880> fun<00:01:38.090> i'd<00:01:38.299> say<00:01:38.479> area<00:01:38.810> crater<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.259> just

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
bit more fun i'd say area crater is just

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.410 
bit more fun i'd say area crater is just
like<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.460> have<00:01:40.610> no<00:01:40.759> risk<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:41.030> dying<00:01:41.240> at

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
like you just have no risk of dying at

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.760 
like you just have no risk of dying at
all<00:01:41.509> because<00:01:41.689> everything<00:01:42.049> dies<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.439> like<00:01:42.560> one

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
all because everything dies in like one

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.770 
all because everything dies in like one
it<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.729> still<00:01:43.939> this<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.090> really<00:01:44.360> quick<00:01:44.599> even

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it but still this is really quick even

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.809 
it but still this is really quick even
though<00:01:44.899> everything<00:01:45.140> doesn't<00:01:45.409> die<00:01:45.649> in<00:01:46.459> one<00:01:46.759> hit

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
though everything doesn't die in one hit

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.550 
though everything doesn't die in one hit
like<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.149> dozen<00:01:47.479> area<00:01:47.720> crater<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.869> blues<00:01:51.140> the

all really quick take as little time as
possible<00:02:24.410> because<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.040> don't<00:02:25.250> want<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.459> to

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
possible because you don't want it to

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.340 
possible because you don't want it to
slow<00:02:25.700> your<00:02:25.819> runs<00:02:26.030> down<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.780> will<00:02:27.019> give<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.260> an

slow your runs down it will give you an

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.650 
slow your runs down it will give you an
extra<00:02:27.530> supplemented<00:02:28.130> five<00:02:28.970> maybe<00:02:29.420> ten

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
extra supplemented five maybe ten

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.120 
extra supplemented five maybe ten
thousand<00:02:30.139> gold<00:02:30.230> depending<00:02:30.680> how<00:02:30.739> many<00:02:30.920> blues

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
thousand gold depending how many blues

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.059 
thousand gold depending how many blues
you<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.630> per<00:02:32.630> run<00:02:32.870> which<00:02:33.200> helps<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.889> only

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
you get per run which helps it only

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.520 
you get per run which helps it only
takes<00:02:34.310> an<00:02:34.459> addition<00:02:35.120> none<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.870> slow<00:02:36.440> down

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
takes an addition none of that slow down

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.140 
takes an addition none of that slow down
Scott<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.950> only<00:02:37.130> takes<00:02:37.370> an<00:02:37.489> additional<00:02:37.940> 30

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
Scott it only takes an additional 30

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.780 
Scott it only takes an additional 30
seconds<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.560> you're<00:02:39.920> quick<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.670> not

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
seconds so if you're quick it's not

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.680 
seconds so if you're quick it's not
really<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.120> big<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.329> a<00:02:41.420> deal<00:02:41.510> it's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
really that big of a deal it's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.920 
really that big of a deal it's
definitely<00:02:42.079> worth<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:43.480> don't<00:02:44.480> do<00:02:44.600> with<00:02:44.810> this

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
definitely worth it I don't do with this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.840 
definitely worth it I don't do with this
run<00:02:45.139> like<00:02:45.319> I<00:02:45.410> said<00:02:45.620> because<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
run like I said because just for the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.990 
run like I said because just for the
sake<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> being<00:02:47.750> lazy<00:02:49.060> no<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:51.850> didn't<00:02:52.850> really

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
sake of being lazy no I I didn't really

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.610 
sake of being lazy no I I didn't really
think<00:02:53.120> about<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.690> too<00:02:53.930> much<00:02:53.959> before<00:02:54.260> doing

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
think about it too much before doing

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.050 
think about it too much before doing
this<00:02:54.829> but<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.130> definitely<00:02:55.489> think<00:02:55.850> it's<00:02:56.000> worth

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this but I definitely think it's worth

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.789 
this but I definitely think it's worth
it<00:02:56.329> now<00:02:56.989> thinking<00:02:57.470> about<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.769> after<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> fact

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
it now thinking about it after the fact

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.960 
it now thinking about it after the fact
people<00:03:00.799> have<00:03:01.010> told<00:03:01.160> me<00:03:01.280> before<00:03:01.430> why<00:03:01.790> don't<00:03:01.910> you

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
people have told me before why don't you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.250 
people have told me before why don't you
pick<00:03:02.090> up<00:03:02.209> all<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.389> blues<00:03:02.569> but<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.900> never<00:03:03.019> really

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
pick up all the blues but I never really

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.500 
pick up all the blues but I never really
was<00:03:03.410> like<00:03:03.500> yeah<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.769> know<00:03:04.010> they<00:03:04.250> they<00:03:04.910> suck

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
was like yeah you know they they suck

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.330 
was like yeah you know they they suck
and<00:03:05.750> they<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:05.959> slows<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.319> down<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:06.739> if

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and they just slows you down but if

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
and they just slows you down but if
they're<00:03:07.519> worth<00:03:07.639> 250<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.599> worth<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.170> it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
they're worth 250 it's worth it and it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.050 
they're worth 250 it's worth it and it
only<00:03:09.500> takes<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.799> second<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.190> hold<00:03:10.519> down<00:03:10.639> control

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
only takes a second to hold down control

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.360 
only takes a second to hold down control
and<00:03:11.090> see<00:03:11.389> if<00:03:11.480> they're<00:03:11.690> worth<00:03:11.810> more<00:03:12.019> than<00:03:12.380> 250
