00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.220 
that are gray I didn't have those yet so
I'm<00:03:36.650> using<00:03:36.980> grateful<00:03:37.639> so<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.449> doesn't<00:03:38.810> no<00:03:38.870> turn

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
I'm using grateful so it doesn't no turn

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.539 
I'm using grateful so it doesn't no turn
it<00:03:39.260> if<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.799> don't<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.129> that

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
it if you don't like that

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.360 
it if you don't like that
I<00:03:41.299> know<00:03:41.480> as<00:03:41.720> well<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:42.799> then<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.160> don't<00:03:43.220> have

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
I know as well so then you don't have

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.949 
I know as well so then you don't have
something<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:47.150> one<00:03:47.449> has<00:03:47.750> an

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
something like this so this one has an

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.770 
something like this so this one has an
excess<00:03:48.379> for<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.889> but<00:03:49.609> now<00:03:49.879> for<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.359> gray<00:03:50.569> one

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
excess for that but now for the gray one

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.319 
excess for that but now for the gray one
measure<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.859> same<00:03:52.069> length<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:52.669> without<00:03:53.030> the

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
measure the same length but without the

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.409 
measure the same length but without the
excess<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:54.829> will<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.370> four<00:03:55.639> centimeters

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
excess so that will be four centimeters

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:04.230 
excess so that will be four centimeters
for<00:03:56.810> mine

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.199 

once<00:04:05.240> you've<00:04:05.690> got<00:04:06.500> those<00:04:06.800> trim<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.000> little

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
once you've got those trim it a little

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.570 
once you've got those trim it a little
bit<00:04:08.480> like<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> really<00:04:09.739> little<00:04:09.980> bit<00:04:10.370> like<00:04:10.550> a

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
bit like a really little bit like a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.640 
bit like a really little bit like a
millimeter<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.989> then<00:04:13.090> yeah<00:04:14.090> I'm<00:04:14.720> not<00:04:15.080> working

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
millimeter and then yeah I'm not working

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.120 
millimeter and then yeah I'm not working
kind<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:15.980> pencil<00:04:16.489> or<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:17.299> pen<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.709> start

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
poking it just do it very hard so it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.240 
poking it just do it very hard so it
makes<00:04:24.860> little<00:04:25.639> indents<00:04:26.800> once<00:04:27.800> you've<00:04:28.040> done

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250
