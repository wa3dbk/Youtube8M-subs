there it's able to read what kind of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600 
there it's able to read what kind of
monitor<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.309> color

monitor I have and what this color

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.040 
monitor I have and what this color
should<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.539> color<00:00:45.809> should<00:00:46.020> be

should be and what that color should be
etc<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.670> I'll<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.149> cut<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> clip<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.410> show

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
etc so I'll just cut to a clip that show

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
etc so I'll just cut to a clip that show
that's<00:00:49.920> showing<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.960> part<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that's showing you like that part of the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
that's showing you like that part of the
procedure<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:54.500> yeah<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.070> basically<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
procedure and then yeah it basically it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.180 
procedure and then yeah it basically it
really<00:00:56.940> does<00:00:57.090> make<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> difference<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
really does make a difference so this is

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.799 
really does make a difference so this is
after<00:00:59.190> I've<00:00:59.340> already<00:00:59.609> calibrated<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.539> it's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
after I've already calibrated it so it's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.990 
after I've already calibrated it so it's
all<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> does<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> made<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
all good and it does make it made a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
all good and it does make it made a
little<00:01:03.300> bit<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> difference<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.199> most<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
little bit of a difference but most of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
little bit of a difference but most of
the<00:01:05.309> time<00:01:05.549> nowadays<00:01:06.270> things<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> be

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the time nowadays things are going to be

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.340 
the time nowadays things are going to be

so in conclusion my opinion of the
spider<00:02:38.569> Pro<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.989> this<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:39.650> you're<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.280> graphic

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
spider Pro is this if you're a graphic

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.160 
spider Pro is this if you're a graphic
designer<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.269> want<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.569> best<00:02:41.810> color

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
designer and you want the best color

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.580 
designer and you want the best color
accuracy<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.670> best<00:02:44.200> contrast<00:02:45.200> and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
accuracy and the best contrast and

accuracy and the best contrast and
brightness<00:02:45.620> levels<00:02:46.310> etc<00:02:46.700> for<00:02:47.600> your<00:02:47.690> screen<00:02:48.110> I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
brightness levels etc for your screen I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.580 
brightness levels etc for your screen I
would<00:02:49.130> recommend<00:02:49.549> getting<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> spider<00:02:50.150> Pro

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
would recommend getting the spider Pro

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.630 
would recommend getting the spider Pro
although<00:02:51.590> if<00:02:51.830> you're<00:02:52.069> just<00:02:52.280> wanting<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.549> play

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
although if you're just wanting to play

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.180 
although if you're just wanting to play
a<00:02:52.790> game<00:02:53.090> or<00:02:53.420> do<00:02:54.140> some<00:02:54.349> video<00:02:54.560> editing<00:02:54.590> here<00:02:55.069> and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
a game or do some video editing here and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.259 
a game or do some video editing here and
there<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.519> think<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> colors<00:02:56.120> are

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
there and you think the colors are

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.340 
there and you think the colors are
pretty<00:02:56.660> well<00:02:57.489> correct<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.730> your<00:02:58.850> monitor<00:02:59.350> then

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
pretty well correct on your monitor then

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.229 
pretty well correct on your monitor then
I<00:03:00.970> wouldn't<00:03:01.970> necessarily<00:03:02.299> recommend<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:05.090> to

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.580 
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to
you<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.400> because<00:03:07.609> my<00:03:07.910> I'm<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:09.079> edit

photos<00:03:09.950> with<00:03:10.250> lots<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.850> video<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.920> things

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
photos with lots of video and things

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.099 
photos with lots of video and things
like<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.100> but<00:03:13.820> really<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.810> didn't<00:03:14.989> make<00:03:15.079> a

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
like that but really it didn't make a

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.130 
like that but really it didn't make a
huge<00:03:15.560> difference<00:03:16.280> but<00:03:16.609> on<00:03:17.329> other<00:03:17.600> sin<00:03:17.959> on

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
huge difference but on other sin on

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.560 
huge difference but on other sin on
other<00:03:18.410> screens<00:03:18.829> such<00:03:19.130> as<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.489> IMAX<00:03:19.850> glossy

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
other screens such as the IMAX glossy

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.949 
other screens such as the IMAX glossy
screen<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.980> really<00:03:22.010> does<00:03:22.540> make<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.600> bit<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.900> an

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
screen it really does make a bit of an

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.910 
screen it really does make a bit of an
impact<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.769> what<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.640> color<00:03:25.940> ratio<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.769> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
impact to what the color ratio is on the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.910 
impact to what the color ratio is on the
MacBooks<00:03:28.400> though<00:03:29.060> they<00:03:29.569> happen<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.470> some

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
MacBooks though they happen to have some

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.220 
MacBooks though they happen to have some

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
of the best color camera calibration

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.650 
of the best color camera calibration
ever<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:34.069> anyone<00:03:34.819> has<00:03:34.910> seen<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> monitor

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
ever that anyone has seen on a monitor
