00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
well the spark plug leads out of the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
well the spark plug leads out of the
coils<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.840> same<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.739> all<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> top<00:00:59.309> either

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
i've got from jet ski solutions in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
i've got from jet ski solutions in
America<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.840> mean<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.409> boots<00:01:10.680> anywhere

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
America I mean get these boots anywhere

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
America I mean get these boots anywhere
really<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> while<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> went<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.830> guys<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
really but while I went to these guys is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.719 
really but while I went to these guys is
they<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.670> their<00:01:14.850> own<00:01:16.189> coil<00:01:17.189> lids<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:18.060> are

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
they make their own coil lids these are

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.820 
they make their own coil lids these are
stainless<00:01:20.729> steel<00:01:22.549> stainless<00:01:23.549> steel<00:01:23.790> cause

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
stainless steel stainless steel cause

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.200 
stainless steel stainless steel cause
and<00:01:25.830> they're<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.280> quite<00:01:26.400> cheap<00:01:26.820> for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and they're actually quite cheap for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.340 
and they're actually quite cheap for
what<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.070> first<00:01:29.070> step<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.350> remove

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
what you get so first step is to remove

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.770 
what you get so first step is to remove
these<00:01:31.740> coils<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.540> then<00:01:33.540> we'll<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> into

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
these coils and then we'll get into

00:01:35.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
these coils and then we'll get into
changing<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> laser

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.919 

make<00:02:09.879> sure<00:02:09.910> when<00:02:10.360> you're<00:02:10.479> pulling<00:02:10.690> apart

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
make sure when you're pulling apart

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.520 
make sure when you're pulling apart
these<00:02:11.549> waterproof<00:02:12.549> sealed<00:02:13.500> connectors<00:02:14.500> that

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
these waterproof sealed connectors that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.100 
these waterproof sealed connectors that
you<00:02:14.739> get<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> good<00:02:15.010> grip<00:02:15.579> on<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.940> metal<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
you get a good grip on the metal and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.339 
you get a good grip on the metal and
update<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.680> pull<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.370> cable<00:02:19.140> or<00:02:20.140> you'll

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
update just pull on the cable or you'll

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.759 
update just pull on the cable or you'll
just<00:02:20.500> rip<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.130> right<00:02:21.489> up<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:23.470> you'll<00:02:23.650> be

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
just rip it right up and then you'll be

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.930 
just rip it right up and then you'll be
annoyed<00:02:24.010> because<00:02:24.370> they're<00:02:24.610> hard<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.849> find

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
annoyed because they're hard to find

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:34.130 
annoyed because they're hard to find
these<00:02:25.269> connectors<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:32.620> will<00:02:32.769> also<00:02:32.890> do<00:02:33.310> is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
these connectors what will also do is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.890 
these connectors what will also do is
change<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.310> earthing<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:37.269> earth<00:02:37.450> them<00:02:37.720> all

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
change the earthing to earth them all

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.010 
change the earthing to earth them all
back<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.349> same<00:02:38.590> spot
