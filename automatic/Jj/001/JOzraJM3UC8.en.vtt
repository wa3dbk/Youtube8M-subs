00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.619
 Hello, first we will use black construction paper and 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.738
 Host size table you like (legal) color 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.960
 Or glue, business card, plus 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.839
 Needle and thread, let's start 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.289
 We put our business card base 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.759
 We put the edge of our plate, where you are 

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:34.530
 Watching 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.560
 go away 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.719
 In the head space 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.969
 Then mark times or 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.710
 Publish sheet guide 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 We mark it as refernce 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.649
 And reference 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.659
 fold 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.109
 We put the plate (the first part) 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.619
 The idea is to make three pockets 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.729
 We are the ones we used to introduce cards, etc. 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.750
 Internal documents 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 Wallet, over time 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.280
 Business card is only used as a reference 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.290
 Mark each pocket 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.379
 I mentioned that we will develop three pockets. 

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.799
 3 per side 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.810
 Let our wallet 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.790
 We have our first pocket, let's talk now 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 The bottom looks like a wallet 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.379
 You can use your wallet as a reference and each 

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:30.439
 pocket 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.799
 card 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.479
 Look, we will card again 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.420
 Mark and fold 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.199
 It's not complicated, but you have to mark it 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.140
 for 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.439
 After doing this (equal to) 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.979
 By size 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.219
 We are doing 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.939
 Other pockets 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.519
 And, just like you see 

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:06.530
 You must repeat this process until three (3) pockets 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.538
 Continue the process and bring it back 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.729
 Much better 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.288
 Here, we commemorate this time 

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:23.238
 I remember you have to get a total of three pockets. 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.528
 we 

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:26.498
 Follow the steps 

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:30.438
 Your wallet 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.949
 Here we mark each pocket 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:20.159
 Repeat the same steps until you get three (3) pockets 

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:28.168
 We have finished the look in our pocket 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.278
 You should stay a bit like what you are looking at, not completely 

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:33.859
 image 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.959
 Just like you can use as a guide, already have a wallet to use 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.989
 Six (6) or similar pocket 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.878
 According to each pocket on the production card 

00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:48.079
 And in the last part, we make a small 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.139
 Folded toward the inside to prevent damage 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.288
 file 

00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:58.358
 Now we are half-folded, as seen in the video and single 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.308
 Please follow the steps below to get your wallet 

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:06.248
 Over time 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.528
 Now we are taking black construction paper and the above 

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:25.269
 The first piece is completed with all the folds 

00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:26.430
 focus 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.449
 And cut around the edges 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.259
 Refer to the first piece 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.550
 With folds 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.050
 After cutting cardboard, you should have something like this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.759
 They must be the same size to the first sheet, ie 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.649
 red 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:50.839
 We glued two pieces very well with glue 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.310
 Be careful not to destroy them because they have the same size 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.040
 Two 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.680
 In this way, you can get 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.588
 wallet 

00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:05.259
 Looks like and joins two pieces 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.629
 Now let's start with needlework 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.559
 Edge seam around the wallet 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.319
 For better results 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.949
 Better finish 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.699
 And the solidarity you see 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.418
 The edge of the wallet around 

00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:28.149
 Almost finished the wallet 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.579
 Ready to sew the complete wallet 

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:58.589
 We only need to complete the sewing center 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.519
 Our wallet 

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.038
 Prepare and complete our wallet 

00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:06.618
 We introduce the card, you see it done 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:10.668
 We have a better finish in the sewing center 

00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:11.859
 At last 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.309
