00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.050
 hi to all you are on planet gt and 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.420
 today we are going to talk about a game whose 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.950
 you have surely heard about cgt at 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.629
 5 or gta 5 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.860
 we will not do a test because it 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.660
 is not a race game properly 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.130
 talk who has a lot to say 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.130
 is that a lot of other sites in 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.109
 that's enough talk however you can 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.910
 talk about driving anyway because 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.699
 that it still represents a good 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.920
 part of the game and finally we could 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.660
 almost like a racing game 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.190
 arcade finally because we pass 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.770
 a lot of time by car or 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.469
 various vehicles so we thought 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.649
 it was rather a good idea of 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.570
 look at what it's worth so the first 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.690
 times when we take a car in gta 5 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.510
 especially if we played gta iv before 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.100
 it's very different 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.809
 very disappointing because in fact the voice 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.180
 driving is much more arcade 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.410
 certainly the cars I do not know if 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.899
 you remember gta iv but the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.920
 cars are were soft 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.300
 there were a lot of transfers of 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.239
 mass suspensions work 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.650
 a lot and a lot of peace and that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.810
 made driving a bit realistic 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.420
 even though on some sports cars 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.010
 it was a terrible step but in general 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.990
 on cars a little classic which one 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 really feels like milk from them 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.320
 put the mouths and they 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.610
 were at the limit each time which 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.740
 is a little different is that there is 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.950
 a lot less of all that we are no longer 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 sure of the arcade to those hardliners 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.120
 then the fact is done and who knows 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.600
 we get used to it and once we 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.160
 has the habit of driving arcade is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.530
 still quite effective we have fun 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.020
 Well, because we just roll fast 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.480
 can really attack make big 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.330
 pursuit sneak in the middle of 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.190
 traffic with quite a few years it's true that 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.610
 on that point I think we win 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.860
 even if it's good that the transfers of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.750
 mass on the big 4 4 and that was enough 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.370
 nice before we go back to 4.4 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 also it is that the fact that they have a 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.680
 big map 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.260
 it also opens something that 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.990
 personally I like it a lot 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.750
 to go for a walk off the trails 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.570
 beaten 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.910
 in the mountains go to 4 4 and 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.560
 frankly it is part of a 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.720
 good pleasure must love 4 4 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.480
 personally I really like that in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.160
 the games it's I spend my time at 4 4 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.380
 so on that point it's pretty successful 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.260
 we'll talk a little too quickly 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.760
 content 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.010
 about vehicles do when we 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.770
 has a lot a lot a lot of 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.690
 diversity and that's really appreciable 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.760
 so of course as usual with the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.150
 gt we do not have a license find you 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.760
 not official models brand 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
 that we know, however, as often 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.800
 also give up all the cars are 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.630
 inspired by real models so he 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.520
 Judge is not enough to be a huge 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.750
 connoisseur to recognize there is ad 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.950
 Rangers over porsche 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.450
 a little more common cars have as well 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.610
 dictate acacias from old 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.489
 american the species of mustang is a 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.459
 kind of challenger we even have a 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.660
 bugatti veyron species which is enough 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.030
 quite rare so we see it pretty little 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.739
 but she's in the game we also 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.799
 some old cars as a 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.860
 old yahia stone martin or ne 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.840
 lamborghini miura 1 cc quite frankly 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.519
 successful we also have less of course we have 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.220
 we have motorcycles quads 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.440
 so if aircraft helicopters 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.980
 dive boats skis bikes a 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.049
 frankly it's pretty good if we 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.350
 talk a bit about bike bikes all that stuff 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:40.570
 we can regret sometimes that this 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.340
 be very very responsive earth that we're going 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.709
 to be quite progressive that we can 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.160
 not necessarily be very precise about the 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.299
 conduct 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.720
 but again it's a question 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.180
 so usually 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.500
 it's going after the planes it's a bit 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.780
 complicated for the moment I had not 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.600
 still flown a lot but I had 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.340
 some worries to be to be everything 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.350
 to be honest mostly composed after 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.880
 but good point too that was 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.760
 added in gta 5 this is the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.080
 customization of vehicles I hope that 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.350
 now we really have a 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.019
 a customization workshop and that is 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.150
 pushed enough for a gta of course and we 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.680
 has visual update we can 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.380
 change the painting we have a choice 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.720
 of chromed maths paintings etc 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.070
 we can really do what we want 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.800
 can also change the nice ones ya not 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.210
 a lot of different people are rather 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.120
 successful we can do enough stuff 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.540
 nice we have according to the models we have 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.310
 small body kits we have two things 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.000
 like that that makes it possible to make a 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.620
 nice car and also we also 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.520
 technical customization serves as one 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.820
 can add a turbo one can edit 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.310
 braking the suspensions even the 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.070
 shielding the car so all that stuff 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.150
 we can really do cool things 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.340
 it's nice enough 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.660
 remains the concern after keeping these 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.980
 cars long enough in 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.500
 enjoy what is not necessarily 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.540
 obvious in a gta one breaks enough 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.160
 often cars 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.800
 incidentally the damage is rather not 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.100
 wrong it's not transcendent with respect to 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.530
 gta iv we do not have a huge evolution 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.060
 but hey it's still nice, according to the 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.250
 cars we really feel that we 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.690
 break quite quickly or not can not 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.580
 to afford anything and everything but 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.790
 good it's still it's still very 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.840
 permissive in a general way one breaks 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.460
 not enough cars at first crash 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.460
 so here we did about the trick 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.310
 of that part which is only a 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.110
 that an aspect of gta 5 of course and everything 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.820
 the rest with the fighting the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.070
 gunfights history etc 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.140
 but that we will not talk about it we you 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.500
 not interested finally sisters that we 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.960
 interest but that's not the point 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.610
 so here you are in the end we are rather 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.890
 seduced by the game even if at first it's 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.170
 true that it's confusing and in the end we 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.970
 even thinks it's better than some 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.530
 arcade racing games 1 frankly one 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.110
 can really spent a lot of time 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.350
 can have fun walking around 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.240
 races end is frankly nice what 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.630
 and then suddenly bah we will return 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.350
 pretty quickly we'll leave you here 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.480
 do not hesitate to tell us what you 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.010
 do you think of your side while waiting 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.960
 you can find us on the site 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.360
 the ngp point as on twitter in plagne 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.890
 I was on facebook is also on 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.350
 youtube so we're going to have a season 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.140
 who will go back with a lot of 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.230
 games releases we will have the next 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.270
 game of f1 or wrc we will see fortassin 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.100
 gran turismo 6 in the coming months

 for sure will tell you about us 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.800
 make gameplay 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.020
 in the meantime you can also go on
