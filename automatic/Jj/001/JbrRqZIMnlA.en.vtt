00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
nourished and that make sense because

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
nourished and that make sense because
health<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:53.969> important<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.600> comes

kind of weigh it down a little bit so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.399 
kind of weigh it down a little bit so
that<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.299> won't<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.080> around

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
tones it so it stops her from being

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.060 
tones it so it stops her from being
yellow<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.350> kind<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.590> lines<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.010> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
little bit and also it goes in the roots

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.030 
little bit and also it goes in the roots
so<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:57.110> sticks<00:01:57.290> out<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.560> makes<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.799> very

keep<00:03:02.390> telling<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.810> cut<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.019> but<00:03:03.230> then<00:03:03.320> use

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
keep telling you to cut it but then use

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.590 
keep telling you to cut it but then use
like<00:03:03.590> no<00:03:03.769> keep<00:03:04.250> go<00:03:04.400> away<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.640> persevere<00:03:05.360> and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
like no keep go away to persevere and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.240 
like no keep go away to persevere and
nobody<00:03:06.079> gets<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.350> bit<00:03:06.560> messy<00:03:06.799> at<00:03:07.010> times

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
nobody gets a little bit messy at times

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.590 
nobody gets a little bit messy at times
they<00:03:07.610> can<00:03:07.640> get<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> star<00:03:08.269> where<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.480> feel

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
they can get to a star where you feel

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.569 
they can get to a star where you feel
like<00:03:08.630> oh<00:03:08.840> my<00:03:08.870> god<00:03:09.200> what<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.829> this<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.100> look<00:03:10.459> like

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
like oh my god what is this I look like

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.580 
like oh my god what is this I look like
a<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:11.030> know<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.720> looks<00:03:11.900> shaggy<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.410> looks

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
a you know it looks shaggy it looks

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.229 
a you know it looks shaggy it looks
stupid<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.579> can<00:03:13.700> do<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.150> can

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
stupid but what you can do is you can

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.420 
stupid but what you can do is you can
get<00:03:14.360> some<00:03:14.420> grass<00:03:15.019> don't<00:03:15.709> get<00:03:15.860> Jeff<00:03:16.130> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
get some grass don't get Jeff the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.280 
get some grass don't get Jeff the
difference<00:03:16.730> between<00:03:16.850> wax<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.600> gel<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:18.079> that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
difference between wax and gel is that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.680 
difference between wax and gel is that
wax<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.709> oil<00:03:18.920> based<00:03:19.250> gel<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.880> water-based<00:03:20.390> gel

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
wax is oil based gel is water-based gel

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.090 
wax is oil based gel is water-based gel
this<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.200> something<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.650> use<00:03:21.680> when<00:03:21.980> you're

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
this is something you use when you're

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.349 
this is something you use when you're
like<00:03:22.280> 10<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.790> when<00:03:22.880> you're<00:03:23.000> in<00:03:23.090> primary

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
school used to like rub it in and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.930 
school used to like rub it in and
they're<00:03:24.500> like<00:03:24.620> do<00:03:24.859> like<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.100> like<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
they're like do like this like the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.120 
they're like do like this like the
flicky<00:03:26.269> fringe<00:03:26.570> thing<00:03:26.959> or<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.680> lick<00:03:28.100> it

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
flicky fringe thing or like just lick it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.130 
flicky fringe thing or like just lick it
back<00:03:28.400> or<00:03:28.640> like<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:28.910> bus<00:03:29.090> drivers<00:03:29.540> use<00:03:29.810> you

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
back or like what bus drivers use you

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.650 
back or like what bus drivers use you
know<00:03:30.200> that's<00:03:30.560> not<00:03:31.070> stereotyping<00:03:31.880> it's<00:03:32.450> just

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
know that's not stereotyping it's just

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.110 
know that's not stereotyping it's just
what<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.840> know<00:03:33.190> basically<00:03:34.190> like<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.459> wax<00:03:34.760> isn't

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
what I know basically like a wax isn't

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.810 
what I know basically like a wax isn't
always<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.959> stops<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.440> from<00:03:36.470> being<00:03:36.620> wet<00:03:37.519> it

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
always so it stops it from being wet it

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.539 
always so it stops it from being wet it
makes<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.239> look<00:03:38.859> dry<00:03:39.859> but<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.250> gives<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.430> that

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
makes it look dry but it gives you that

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.490 
makes it look dry but it gives you that
texture<00:03:41.000> I'm<00:03:41.359> also<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.989> way<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.200> get<00:03:42.350> more

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
texture I'm also a way to get more

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.870 
texture I'm also a way to get more
volume<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:43.130> blow<00:03:44.000> drying<00:03:44.299> and

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
volume is blow drying and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.480 
volume is blow drying and
as<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.210> said<00:03:45.390> earlier<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.250> when<00:03:47.400> you're

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
as I said earlier this so when you're

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.640 
as I said earlier this so when you're
growing<00:03:47.550> outta<00:03:47.820> here<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.630> can't<00:03:48.870> diet<00:03:49.140> like

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
growing outta here you can't diet like

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.620 
growing outta here you can't diet like
you<00:03:49.770> can<00:03:49.920> diet<00:03:50.160> but<00:03:50.460> it<00:03:50.580> also<00:03:50.760> has<00:03:51.090> ammonia<00:03:51.450> in

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
you can diet but it also has ammonia in

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.760 
you can diet but it also has ammonia in
it<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:51.840> moany<00:03:52.020> is<00:03:52.110> not<00:03:52.260> very<00:03:52.410> good<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.710> the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
it so moany is not very good for the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.260 
it so moany is not very good for the
health<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.190> hair<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.090> really

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
health of the hair but it's not really

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.090 
health of the hair but it's not really
going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.570> do<00:03:55.020> too<00:03:55.170> much<00:03:55.290> what's<00:03:55.770> gonna<00:03:55.860> do<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
going to do too much what's gonna do is

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.520 
going to do too much what's gonna do is
is<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.310> gonna<00:03:56.520> coat<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> hair<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.380> can
