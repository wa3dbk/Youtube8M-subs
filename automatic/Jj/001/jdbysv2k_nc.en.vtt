 Hello i am entertaining i have a cell phone it is not great one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.850
 real handicap that I took for granted so it is 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.969
 that was not it 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.369
 at least until the mid-90s young people are explaining food 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.529
 There were times when you could not call everywhere or SMS 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.240
 write or just start on the density 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.630
 The man was sitting in a bar at the time 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.619
 Money you face and you talked that means you talked 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.380
 mid 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.430
 each other 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.260
 In other words, there was partial communication without electricity analog 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.220
 Young people often died of being completely stunned by the stock market 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.239
 added WÃ¤lti 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.550
 SID you did not have a helmet 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.760

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.050
 Sir, we agreed on a specific time at a certain time 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.820
 place 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 yes places already existed before Google Maps and this place is spellbound usually only briefly 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.070
 since one only arranged with people who also had watches 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.840
 missed with it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.340
 then it was shit Â» 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.430
 more and what that stood for as ordered and not picked it up 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.340
 were bad times, yes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.910
 You had to call in a so-called telephone booth tests were like that 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.190
 Count the glass the child the today that there are still consumers 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.470
 but the longing for the mobile phone calls was already so big 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.080
 that many listeners in the middle of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 there one stood in the cell one could still not telephone 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.930
 So in a sense how mean 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.380

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.130

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 Battery is empty as it used to be 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460
 smoking in the phone booth 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.740
 the listener way was doing it too, especially the twelve year old they were in 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.630

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.720

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.270
 Incidentally, the phone numbers were earlier 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:20.799

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.199
 Now my new phone should be affectionate and it should not be tender 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.319

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.759
