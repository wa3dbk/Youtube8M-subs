00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.240
 hi everyone knows gallix and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.589
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.960
 new video a video test of weapons 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.910
 on a sniper I particularly 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.889
 appreciated who just came out 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.269
 and came out today on the 25th 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.830
 January 2013 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.170
 well i will test it forward 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 first here so I'm accompanied 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.859
 of a lot of people I am accompanied by 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 drago locks of toman alexis 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.289
 swift sir and wallpaper and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
 dad bastonne 75 this is this sniper he 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 has a particularity we will say he has not 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.300
 viewfinder we could see we are aiming at 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 the small point actually is exactly 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.070
 like the warfighter but in commando 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 can expect now that we 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.820
 go out a gunner warfighter then 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.890
 it will surely be the next this puts 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.120
 that's pretty sure but we do not know 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.550
 at all what will it look like so we 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 will test all of this closely 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 personally what we feel 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.559
 it's still a sniper 1 on the bass and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 by far it's extremely powerful you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 will see all that wait I repeat 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 I'm filming here and so we'll start 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.520
 on toan here we will start closely 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.780
 and without the blood the worst singh shoot so 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 we still see it's the 35th of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 fifteen of the here it is very very badly 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.750
 you will see bah you imagine I 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.979
 am I am normally sniper 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.080
 release did not do any damage at all 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.119
 when it's more accurate 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.439
 because we are getting closer and here we are 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.670
 that's still a sniper 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 still does 1 million damage from 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.240
 near and you'll see that if I 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.130
 away from me he's doing even more damage 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 that's a nice little shock 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.900
 excuse me my child but he is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.700
 really not bad this sector I want 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.700
 to let off steam we will test with the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.210
 I'm sorry, I told them to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.530
 stay there 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.110
 so here we will test from afar with the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.009
 person shooter ah yes against this 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.479
 weapon a slight recoil 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.700
 so the damage is huge I do not know 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 if you had 118 of the 80 da roughly 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.509
 it's like a basic sniper but 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.040
 but but we did not bother to 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.630
 have the big miller who takes everything 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 the screen in fact we have the lot the trick of the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.540
 wharf felt and one has one highly to say 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.399
 well on this game the viewfinder so I can 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.259
 still tell you the name of the sniper in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.490
 national so in national English 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.290
 of course if it's called the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 electro slingers do not know what that wants 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.790
 to say it's still one of the translations 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.899
 queer ez eo royal we have a 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.840
 translation even more ugly 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.610
 it's called the hyperdrive iphone or 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.260
 take it depends on your action me 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.519
 perso mine it is rotten 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.870
 and so here it is a shame that I 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.530
 you strongly advise she is at 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.579
 price currently 2,999 for one day 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.530
 and two 5999 ould for infinity knowing 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.090
 that these prices are there who say that they 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.000
 maybe change I do not know it was 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.629
 written in the in the ram file 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.519
 after all, I do not know if it's a 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.930
 picture where I do not know we'll see all 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.280
 way but the price we know it's up to 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.269
 about that because right now they 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.579
 are all at this price there weapons 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.640
 it's been Christmas since that's it and we're going 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.390
 for pleasure still remained this tree 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.519
 we will do 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.870
 it's been a month since it hurts 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.159
 really very very badly I show it to you 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.470
 again on canvas 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:56.310
 we take twice that accurate 1 it's a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.569
 little teaser it's not great and that's it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.530
 can not have everything anyway it's a 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.690
 excellent sanitary me me you 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.859

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.420
