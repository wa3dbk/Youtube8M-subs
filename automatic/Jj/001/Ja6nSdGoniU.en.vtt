00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.060
 Good evening everyone figure is Yes this Galant is here 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:12.770
 Open the Guardians of the Galaxy Star Road of Wacky Wobbler 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.280
 For those who have never seen it, I think that the impression of this mask is that it is an absolute villain. 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.240
 but 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.039
 After seeing the gravel and the It is hero movie of Guardians Of The Galaxy and louver 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:36.500
 The impression has changed and the mask looks like a hero only 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:37.670
 I'm going to open the black soon Uedo c Buber Yes here is Peter Ku 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.480
 Do 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.280
 Well I hope parentheses 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 Here it is unlucky to about blaster'm not struck the person by mistake eh 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.190
 It also'm this mask First anything 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.090
 I think quite a high degree of reproducibility 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.390
 I feel called Naa are making stuck I There is only a hero 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.160
 In fact, I think this mask is the insanely cool way of mounting 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.550
 It's more like a mask coming out than wearing a mask, but I 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.030
 When I first saw the gimmick , this mask became a gokey lover 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.900
 The place where this mask is not full face is attractive again 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 Hair of hair comes out and little chestnut around this is good 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 To the is very 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.220
 A little heavy is too high reproducibility of the mask if there is I'm cool just kore one one drawback 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 I think it's too much 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:35.539
 I think this about is I fell but those who are floating is I think a good parentheses in the wo of the day 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.539
 It might be a little bit, and then it was impressive even in this play . 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:51.910
 Booboo star n 4 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.920
 Well, I have properly included the fine molding of that place 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:01.540
 This refers to the part a was or this kind of effect of the belt where the drink will yo Toka properly shoulder 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:06.990
 The area is also shaped and it's made really finely, but when I see Haka, I feel like this 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.490
 It I had been a bag to say this but is this in fact if there here real thing now 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.800
 This is it 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:19.170
 My back, which of course are using sleeves this many years because it was happens to be the same shape 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.610
 When I noticed this, I worked a little bit and the boots were also shaped quite finely 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.860
 Ne 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.370
 It looks like this when lined up with rockets If you are quite smart compared to rockets after all 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.049
 It is small 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.129
 I think it's a thought I think it 's well balanced and lined up 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.760
 It may be interesting to arrange in this way, I think that I told you before 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.810
 but 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.810
