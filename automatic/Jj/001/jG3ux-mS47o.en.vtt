so we go to a different phase there but
when<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> have<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.000> like<00:03:01.180> club<00:03:01.480> music<00:03:01.870> going

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
when you have this like club music going

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.140 
when you have this like club music going
on<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:05.709> was<00:03:05.920> actually<00:03:06.069> lady<00:03:06.490> sing<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.000> that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
on it was actually lady sing to that

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.199 
on it was actually lady sing to that
melody<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.720> it's<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:07.990> isn't<00:03:08.860> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.940> c

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
melody so it's just isn't going to c

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.140 
melody so it's just isn't going to c
minor<00:03:10.620> chord<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.740> C<00:03:11.800> minor<00:03:12.069> 7<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.030> have

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
minor chord of C minor 7 so you have

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.490 
minor chord of C minor 7 so you have
like

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.470 

yep<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.550> can<00:03:22.670> kind<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.000> keep<00:03:23.210> this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
yep and then you can kind of keep this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:35.790 
yep and then you can kind of keep this
going<00:03:23.870> here<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.740> be<00:03:24.950> flat<00:03:28.180> down<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.510> flat

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.280 

grab<00:03:36.800> somebody<00:03:37.280> sexy<00:03:37.370> time<00:03:38.090> hey<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.960> then<00:03:39.170> it

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
grab somebody sexy time hey and then it

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.200 
grab somebody sexy time hey and then it
goes<00:03:39.460> like<00:03:41.110> flat<00:03:42.130> flat<00:03:43.130> B<00:03:43.490> flat<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.180> is

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
goes like flat flat B flat so this is

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.380 
goes like flat flat B flat so this is
the<00:03:44.330> next<00:03:44.510> phase<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.160> happens<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:47.030> little

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
the next phase and this happens a little

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:59.710 
the next phase and this happens a little
quicker<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:53.560> B<00:03:54.560> flat<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.240> like

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.000 

so<00:04:00.720> if<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> want<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.110> follow<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.500> melody<00:04:01.860> what

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
so if you want to follow the melody what

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.130 
so if you want to follow the melody what
we<00:04:02.069> can<00:04:02.220> do<00:04:08.330> is<00:04:09.330> we're<00:04:09.510> gonna<00:04:09.599> play<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> chords

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
we can do is we're gonna play the chords

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.650 
we can do is we're gonna play the chords
this<00:04:10.230> way<00:04:10.379> so<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> be<00:04:10.860> slider

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
this way so it's going to be slider

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.909 
this way so it's going to be slider
which<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.810> G<00:04:13.080> C<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.620> E<00:04:13.739> flat<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.440> flat

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
which is G C and E flat to the a flat

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:25.550 
which is G C and E flat to the a flat
chord<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.639> flat<00:04:18.479> C<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.930> D<00:04:19.500> flat<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:25.380> that's

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
chord a flat C and D flat so that's

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.800 
chord a flat C and D flat so that's
going<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> be<00:04:25.910> everything<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.060> boo<00:04:27.300> flat<00:04:27.540> D

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
going to be everything is boo flat D

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.030 
going to be everything is boo flat D
flat<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.229> G<00:04:28.470> up<00:04:28.620> here<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:31.530> then<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:31.889> go<00:04:32.010> to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
flat and G up here and then we go to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.100 
flat and G up here and then we go to
that<00:04:32.250> B<00:04:32.430> flat<00:04:32.700> for<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.330> quick<00:04:33.540> minute<00:04:33.780> when<00:04:33.990> we

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
that B flat for a quick minute when we

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.100 
that B flat for a quick minute when we
be<00:04:34.470> flats<00:04:34.770> gonna<00:04:35.040> be<00:04:35.220> like<00:04:35.370> if<00:04:35.700> B<00:04:36.450> flat<00:04:36.720> addy

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
be flats gonna be like if B flat addy

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.840 
be flats gonna be like if B flat addy
but<00:04:37.440> first<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.919> start<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.340> Melody's<00:04:38.700> gonna

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:05:02.360 

c<00:04:49.340> minor

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:19.470 

so<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.460> rapport<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:15.099> then<00:05:15.340> like
