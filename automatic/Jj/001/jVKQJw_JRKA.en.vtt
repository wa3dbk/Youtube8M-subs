think<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.820> i<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
think about it i think it's a it's a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.220 
think about it i think it's a it's a
beautiful<00:00:28.830> course<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.849> view<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.480> training<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
beautiful course the view in training is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.960 
beautiful course the view in training is
nice<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.800> i<00:00:31.919> guess<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.309> race<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.760> won't

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
nice but i guess in the race we won't

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.420 
nice but i guess in the race we won't
see<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.470> it's<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.860> hard<00:00:35.070> course

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
see that but it's a it's a hard course

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
see that but it's a it's a hard course
but<00:00:35.760> i<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.330> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.629> good<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.710> good

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
but i think it's a good one for the good

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520 
but i think it's a good one for the good
strong<00:00:38.280> climbers<00:00:39.019> what<00:00:40.019> was<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> hardest

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
strong climbers what was the hardest

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.670 
strong climbers what was the hardest
part<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> curse<00:00:41.489> today<00:00:42.230> yeah<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.290> think

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
part of the curse today yeah I think

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.299 
part of the curse today yeah I think
obviously<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.629> last<00:00:46.110> four<00:00:46.500> kilometres<00:00:46.800> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
obviously the last four kilometres with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.289 
obviously the last four kilometres with
it's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.790> steep<00:00:48.120> climb<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:50.059> haven't<00:00:51.059> seen

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
it's a steep climb I haven't seen

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's a steep climb I haven't seen
anything<00:00:51.600> quite<00:00:51.900> so<00:00:52.019> hard<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.159> world

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
anything quite so hard in a world

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.359 
anything quite so hard in a world
championship<00:00:53.879> course<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.900> think<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.559> will

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
championship course so I think that will

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.670 
championship course so I think that will
be<00:00:56.400> crucial<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.989> distance<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
be crucial but also the distance is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.979 
be crucial but also the distance is
going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.040> make<00:00:59.190> everything<00:00:59.510> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.629> every

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to make everything you know every

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.119 
going to make everything you know every
climb<00:01:01.260> much<00:01:01.589> much<00:01:01.860> harder<00:01:02.150> you're<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.390> third

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
climb much much harder you're the third

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.560 
climb much much harder you're the third
nowaday<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.790> UCI<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> ranking<00:01:07.260> word<00:01:07.979> tour

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
do you feel the responsibility to be the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.240 
do you feel the responsibility to be the
next<00:01:11.850> championship<00:01:12.650> yeah<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.100> mean

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
obviously this year I've had a good year

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.880 
obviously this year I've had a good year
winning<00:01:16.590> Perry<00:01:16.950> nice<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:18.409> it's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.530> long<00:01:19.680> way

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
winning Perry nice but it's a long way

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.560 
winning Perry nice but it's a long way
you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.610> another<00:01:20.820> five<00:01:21.149> more<00:01:21.390> months

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you know it's another five more months

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
you know it's another five more months
until<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.229> world<00:01:22.469> championship<00:01:23.219> so<00:01:23.520> yeah<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
until the world championship so yeah I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
until the world championship so yeah I
think<00:01:24.840> there's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.530> responsibility

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
think there's a lot of responsibility

think there's a lot of responsibility
that<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.329> interesting<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:27.929> see<00:01:28.200> how
