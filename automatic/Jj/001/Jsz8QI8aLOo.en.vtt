00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
their oil is separated from the peanut

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.250 
their oil is separated from the peanut
now<00:00:16.980> usually<00:00:17.980> this<00:00:18.340> is<00:00:18.490> besides<00:00:18.880> I<00:00:19.060> body<00:00:19.300> so

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
now usually this is besides I body so

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.710 
now usually this is besides I body so
this<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.619> not<00:00:20.859> the<00:00:21.070> size<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.390> there<00:00:22.600> were

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
this is not the size and there were

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.769 
this is not the size and there were
mixed<00:00:22.990> peanut<00:00:23.830> butter<00:00:24.010> this<00:00:24.250> way<00:00:24.490> before<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
mixed peanut butter this way before so

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.040 
mixed peanut butter this way before so
this<00:00:26.050> may<00:00:26.410> or<00:00:26.619> may<00:00:26.800> not<00:00:26.830> work<00:00:27.189> too<00:00:27.430> good

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this may or may not work too good

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.070 
this may or may not work too good
anyway<00:00:29.050> that's<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.769> size<00:00:29.980> when<00:00:30.279> we<00:00:30.429> use<00:00:30.580> so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
anyway that's the size when we use so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.299 
anyway that's the size when we use so
let's<00:00:32.080> go<00:00:32.259> ahead<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.500> try<00:00:32.590> this<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:33.040> see<00:00:33.070> if<00:00:33.219> it

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
let's go ahead and try this to see if it

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
let's go ahead and try this to see if it
works

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:50.280 

brand<00:00:38.590> new<00:00:38.770> onion<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.329> child<00:00:43.660> can

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.750 

I<00:00:51.300> buy<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.360> at<00:00:52.660> Walmart

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.670 

I<00:00:59.980> see<00:01:01.690> never<00:01:02.690> be<00:01:02.870> mixed<00:01:03.110> before<00:01:04.990> and<00:01:05.990> if<00:01:06.560> you

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
I see never be mixed before and if you

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.280

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
it just spills into where it makes a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.690 
it just spills into where it makes a
huge<00:01:11.090> mess<00:01:11.500> it's<00:01:12.500> very<00:01:12.800> hard<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.159> do<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:13.580> this

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
huge mess it's very hard to do but this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.690 
huge mess it's very hard to do but this
is<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.030> peanut<00:01:14.300> butter<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:14.720> should<00:01:15.020> use
