00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.599
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490
 new video to destiny the inferno mode 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 has been since tuesday since yesterday 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.500
 active again and that means we can 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.439
 go into the pvp mode and people 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 smack away without radar to the left that is 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.369
 definitely a very good game experience 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 but of course you realize many have 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.210
 do not bother on pvp and then just there 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.070
 where most people think that you are there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.830
 Continue with shotguns so pumpguns 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 runs around and sits in the corners and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 Unrat because you do not see the people that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 that can be very annoying 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 that's why bungie wants to go there 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 Bit against stone and make a new one 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.210
 event and you can the guardians 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.899

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.469

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.149

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.660
 37 in the evening take place in Germany 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.290
 that would be the second april at 4 o'clock 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.150
 30 in the morning so 4 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.950
 The whole thing starts then two 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 hours now some wonder how 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 I recognize these people because of that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 we show you the four people here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.869
 be on the pvp from this time on the road 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 and you have to defeat them 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 for example, to get special excavators 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 My name is Fink you know 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 maybe he has about 100,000 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 subscribers on youtube in america so 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.479
 pretty interesting guy and yes there 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.610
 Some will think now or that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 you do not meet anyway I have 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.630
 do not mind it a general pvp it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.840
 boring then you should ever do that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 Check-in because exactly two weeks ago 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.770
 I have them at exactly the same time 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.570
 met together the railroader 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.329
 a little grip definitely has 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770
 pretty fun and yes here 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.670
 you definitely that you are these people 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.990
 can meet 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.549
 and I would probably be in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.140
 been an opposing team and it would be 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 I would have had this time now 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.909
 fucking exclusive banner ok should not 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.640
 and that's why we are from 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.020
 ctv participate in this event if you 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.629
 then you are also online 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.069
 maybe we can six to six 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.560
 So teams still do 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.870
 Four people can join our team 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.849
 then we look for this group around us 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.889
 exclusive to Amazon if you like it 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.170
