 How do you sell a car today? 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.339
 of 50 thousand because whenever we go 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:16.019

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.019

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.129

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:44.769

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:52.449
 online choose characters and press x 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:59.199

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:02.289

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:07.230
 create the character or 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:11.740
 have then that is what they do 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:19.020
 I'm going to buy a car either. 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.020
 Look, it's an excuse the resolution of the video 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.670

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.780
 catch 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.799
 So the tank I already bought I'll call a 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.640
 mechanic who does not expect the car and 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.640

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.030
 You guys really do it right. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:28.310

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:57.820
