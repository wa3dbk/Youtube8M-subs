 gathered at home dozens of species of choristers 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.769
 and birds of prey alone feathered delight him 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 his singing while others help science 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.080
 maybe soon in science city 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 bird of prey will protect 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 agricultural crops from birds 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.960
 pests looked at feathered 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.560
 collection of Michurin scientist Olga 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560
 Sergeyeva 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 by no broadcast other corvids around about 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 that the predator is detected from the tape 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 power to kick 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.440
 so we can distract the crow 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 some objects despite the fact that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.399
 Vladimir Lamanov Head of Laboratory 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 floriculture in high school he is also good

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 now with my michurinsk my 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.739
 colleagues he is working on a project 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.530
 creating an ornithological service in 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.199
 Science City in Germany in a number of other 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.809
 European countries have long been used 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.230
 the theological protection system viz 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.359
 use bird of prey fear that 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 small birds and laid genetically then 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.229
 there is enough one lapping predatory 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.630
 birds such as falcon and black hawk and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.790
 from allowing poultry to be diverted 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.799
 the garden for two or three weeks in Russia too 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.689
 there are ornithological services for example 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 on the territory of major airports and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.900
 cuttings and scientists will first hold 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.979
 experiment on green space 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.200
 the institute itself 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.820
 if the result is good then you can 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.799
 will spread this experience and in 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.290
 the area, however, the birds is a hobby 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.970
 Vladimir since childhood childhood owl lives 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.460

 Vladimir picked it up on the road near the bird 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.850
 the wing and paw were broken but in the end 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.329
 the birds had to live in captivity that is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.970
 I cannot return nature now 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.630
 spells his life revive owls to 30 40 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 years in captivity 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.759
 that is, she is still young about two or three 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.530
 years no more in the thirteenth year 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.780
 Vladimir spoke in Saratov on 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.430
 interregional with people falconers where 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.430
 with his falcon won first place 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.170
 in the winter in an unheated room 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.720
 only have to keep those birds 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 which tolerates frosts therefore 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.210
 Nightingales for the winter lets go that is 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.420
 in the spring of birds caught she otpel season was 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.570
 Zemana released somewhere in the south 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.950
 Africa or depending on which species in the countries 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.530
 Mediterranean rule 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.050
 and then candles in the spring go catch on 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.430
 hunt you catch and you already know the birds that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.560
 You have already lived that is on again 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.870
 returns another season opens and 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.610
 back to freedom now 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.070
 besides birds of prey live in Vladimir 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.320
 Bunting Linnet Oleuphonus Greenfinch Rea 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.090
 Goldfinch by the way caught 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.130
 the only bird that can crawl 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.380
 head down the tree about 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.580
 small tit per day eats 3 times 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.950
 more than your weight 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.940
 often feathered behave like people love 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.940
 sort things out 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.840
 This is the most common tackle for 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.700
 catching birds 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 bait trap 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.329
 use a decoy bird which its 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.040
 voice attract sick birds and 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:12.469
 it works very simply there 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.430
 opinion that the bird in captivity does not sing however 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.739
 says Vladimir 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.879
 This is not at all the case and although our cell is not 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.920
 succeeded from these pennies 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:24.469
 frame from the personal archive of Vladimir this 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:28.239
