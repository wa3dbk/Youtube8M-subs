00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.169 

right<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.309> partway<00:00:14.820> through

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
right so we're just partway through

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.080 
right so we're just partway through
building<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.379> diff<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.279> transmission

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
building the diff and transmission

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.550 
building the diff and transmission
actually<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.690> completely<00:00:19.020> finished<00:00:19.380> building

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
actually we completely finished building

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.400 
actually we completely finished building
the<00:00:19.740> diff<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.000> halfway<00:00:21.779> through<00:00:21.930> building

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the diff and halfway through building

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.130 
the diff and halfway through building
transmission<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:24.000> want<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> show<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.420> how

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
transmission I just want to show you how

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.070 
transmission I just want to show you how
associated<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.660> set<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> diff

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
associated have you set the diff

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.330 
associated have you set the diff
initially<00:00:29.240> basically<00:00:30.949> if<00:00:31.949> you're<00:00:32.160> familiar

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
initially basically if you're familiar

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.130 
initially basically if you're familiar
with<00:00:32.550> Baal<00:00:32.940> Tiff's<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.329> all

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
with Baal Tiff's at all

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220 
with Baal Tiff's at all
you've<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.360> thrust<00:00:36.660> bearing

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you've got the thrust bearing

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.560 
you've got the thrust bearing
that's<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:38.190> side<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that's on one side here it's on this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
that's on one side here it's on this
side<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.800> spring<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> very

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
side and then the spring which is a very

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.450 
side and then the spring which is a very
stiff<00:00:42.510> spring<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.129> locking<00:00:45.000> nut

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
stiff spring and then a locking nut

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.010 
stiff spring and then a locking nut
t-nut<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.480> call<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.870> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
t-nut was what they call it but it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.979 
t-nut was what they call it but it's
encased<00:00:49.920> around<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:52.620> lock<00:00:53.430> nut<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
encased around a lock nut there and so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
encased around a lock nut there and so
what<00:00:55.469> we're<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:57.149> just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
what we're going to do is you just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
what we're going to do is you just
tighten<00:00:57.719> everything<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.789> when<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
tighten everything down and when you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.709 
tighten everything down and when you
feel<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:01.350> tight<00:01:02.239> don't<00:01:03.239> tighten<00:01:03.480> any

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
feel it get tight don't tighten any

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.200 
feel it get tight don't tighten any
further<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> loosen<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
further and then you loosen it by a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.230 
further and then you loosen it by a
quarter<00:01:06.810> turn<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:08.520> should<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.060> you're

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
quarter turn so you should if you're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.460 
quarter turn so you should if you're
holding<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
holding one side of the of the of the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.219 
holding one side of the of the of the
diff<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:14.100> different<00:01:14.460> drive<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:15.299> give<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
diff one different drive just give it a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
diff one different drive just give it a
spin<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.890> should<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.490> should<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.729> nice<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
spin and it should it should be nice and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.570 
spin and it should it should be nice and
smooth<00:01:18.860> with<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.820> bit<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> resistance

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
smooth with a little bit of resistance

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.109 
smooth with a little bit of resistance
and<00:01:24.409> then<00:01:25.409> after<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> drive<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> car<00:01:26.460> once<00:01:26.939> or

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
and then after you drive the car once or

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.219 
and then after you drive the car once or
twice<00:01:27.500> just<00:01:28.500> check<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> diff<00:01:29.310> setting<00:01:29.610> again

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
twice just check the diff setting again

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.490 
twice just check the diff setting again
just<00:01:31.369> just<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> wheels<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:34.200> spin

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
just just with the wheels you just spin

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
just just with the wheels you just spin
the<00:01:34.619> wheels

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the wheels

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
the wheels
before<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> first<00:01:36.329> run<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> get<00:01:37.409> an

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
before you first run just so you get an

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
before you first run just so you get an
idea<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> how<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.790> they're<00:01:38.970> meant<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> feel

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
idea of how what they're meant to feel

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.530 
idea of how what they're meant to feel
like<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.970> after<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.299> first

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
like and then after you do your first

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270 
like and then after you do your first
run<00:01:42.810> obviously<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> differs<00:01:43.829> starting<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
run obviously the differs starting to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
run obviously the differs starting to
wear<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.210> difference<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> everything

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
wear in on the difference and everything

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.010 
wear in on the difference and everything
inside<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.909> just

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
inside there and then so you just

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
inside there and then so you just
tighten<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.619> check<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
tighten it a little bit and check it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.280 
tighten it a little bit and check it
again<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.420> make<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.810> feels<00:01:51.990> about

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
again and just make sure it feels about

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740 
again and just make sure it feels about
the<00:01:52.470> same<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.979> did<00:01:53.340> before<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.659> an

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the same as I did before so it's an

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.020 
the same as I did before so it's an
important<00:01:55.110> setting<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.340> steering<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
important setting for your steering and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.810 
important setting for your steering and
your<00:01:57.540> traction<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.200> stuff<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
your traction and stuff like that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.719 
your traction and stuff like that
in<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> turns<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
in and out of the turns so it's just

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
in and out of the turns so it's just
something<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.649> associated<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.890> do

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
something that associated have you do

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.110 
something that associated have you do
it's<00:02:05.399> very<00:02:05.490> simple<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
it's very simple and so that's it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.839 
it's very simple and so that's it
we'll<00:02:11.900> carry<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.319> with<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.860> rest<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
we'll carry on with the rest of the

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.899 
we'll carry on with the rest of the
build

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.949 

all<00:02:20.909> right<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.239> are<00:02:21.330> we've<00:02:21.690> just

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
all right here we are we've just

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.380 
all right here we are we've just
finished<00:02:22.489> back<00:02:23.489> C<00:02:24.330> &amp;<00:02:24.769> CC<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.209> RC<00:02:27.209> 10

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
finished back C &amp; CC of the RC 10

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.190 
finished back C &amp; CC of the RC 10
world's<00:02:27.900> car<00:02:28.620> build<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:30.330> has<00:02:30.629> been<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
world's car build and this has been the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
world's car build and this has been the
transmission<00:02:31.909> so<00:02:34.129> having<00:02:35.150> recently

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
transmission so having recently

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.170 
transmission so having recently
assembled<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.200> RC<00:02:38.010> 10<00:02:38.190> gold<00:02:38.430> chassis<00:02:38.879> can

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
assembled the RC 10 gold chassis can

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.710 
assembled the RC 10 gold chassis can
tell<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:40.440> transmission<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
tell you that this transmission is so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.420 
tell you that this transmission is so
much<00:02:42.900> smaller<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:44.599> much<00:02:45.860> much<00:02:46.860> easier<00:02:46.890> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
much smaller and much much easier to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.670 
much smaller and much much easier to
build<00:02:47.659> then<00:02:48.659> then<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.560> original<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.049> quite

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
build then then the original it is quite

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.250 
build then then the original it is quite
a<00:02:52.709> revelation<00:02:53.099> really<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.629> for<00:02:55.079> just

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
a revelation really and just for just

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.240 
a revelation really and just for just
for<00:02:55.379> comparison<00:02:55.680> sake<00:02:57.920> we've<00:02:58.920> got<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
for comparison sake we've got the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.800 
for comparison sake we've got the
original<00:02:59.609> one<00:02:59.730> here<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.650> see<00:03:02.720> if<00:03:03.720> we

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
original one here and you can see if we

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.300 
original one here and you can see if we
just<00:03:04.019> hold<00:03:04.230> them<00:03:04.379> up<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> motor<00:03:04.829> plates<00:03:05.099> are

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
just hold them up the motor plates are

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.990 
just hold them up the motor plates are
pretty<00:03:05.489> much<00:03:05.579> identical<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:08.069> know<00:03:08.159> in<00:03:09.680> size

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
pretty much identical you know in size

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.740 
pretty much identical you know in size
obviously<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.390> how<00:03:15.599> much

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
obviously and you can see how much

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.500 
obviously and you can see how much
thinner<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:18.420> see<00:03:18.629> that<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:20.329> how<00:03:21.329> much

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
thinner it is you see that and how much

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.370 
thinner it is you see that and how much
just<00:03:22.049> more<00:03:22.290> compact<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:24.169> now<00:03:25.169> it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
just more compact it is now it's

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.170 
just more compact it is now it's
obviously<00:03:25.680> thinner<00:03:26.160> because<00:03:26.489> it's<00:03:26.639> got<00:03:26.819> only

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
obviously thinner because it's got only

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.330 
obviously thinner because it's got only
three<00:03:27.599> gears<00:03:27.840> inside<00:03:28.200> instead<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.680> six<00:03:29.040> like

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
three gears inside instead of six like

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.190 
three gears inside instead of six like
like<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.060> does<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:33.599> can<00:03:33.690> see<00:03:33.959> it's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
like this one does and you can see it's

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.569 
like this one does and you can see it's
just<00:03:34.440> it's<00:03:35.129> just<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.459> much<00:03:35.639> more<00:03:36.319> compact<00:03:37.579> and

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
just it's just a much more compact and

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.259 
just it's just a much more compact and
therefore<00:03:39.030> more<00:03:39.209> efficient<00:03:39.810> unit<00:03:40.519> than<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.250 

than<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.480> original<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.109> from<00:03:46.910> 1983<00:03:48.049> this<00:03:49.049> is

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
than the original one from 1983 this is

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.010 
than the original one from 1983 this is
from<00:03:49.410> 1993<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.750> gives<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.079> an<00:03:52.169> idea

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.370 

and<00:03:59.680> well<00:04:00.940> we<00:04:01.940> showed<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.270> how<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.450> how<00:04:03.320> to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
and well we showed you how the how to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.400 
and well we showed you how the how to
adjust<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:04.100> diff<00:04:05.110> everything<00:04:06.110> goes<00:04:06.230> together

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
adjust the diff everything goes together

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.080 
adjust the diff everything goes together
pretty<00:04:06.830> easily<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.310> you've<00:04:07.460> built<00:04:07.670> ball<00:04:07.880> dips

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
pretty easily if you've built ball dips

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.190 
pretty easily if you've built ball dips

well really it's a standard bolt if

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
there's large diff bearings and then

there's large diff bearings and then
there's<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.940> smaller<00:04:38.240> thrust<00:04:38.660> bearing<00:04:39.080> balls
