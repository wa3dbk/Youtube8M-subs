00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.250
 so friends and welcome back to 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.570
 a new fashion review and this time 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 meticulous yes that has me 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.370
 Subscriber proposed and the job 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 I just right now and before 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.359
 Although we can get a computer here 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.910
 Forces how to do that, there I do it 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.039
 Of course here are three iron redstone 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.109
 diamond redstone and another three iron 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 but do you have the computer that is one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 Computer will do with right click 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.380
 on it and puts in the paper purely and how 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.450
 you see, there are these procedures and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.980
 then when the whole is done then 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 you get a script the pasta akf and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.899
 Although the smile there you get random 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.980
 any of i happen to believe it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.000
 nine pieces so would be nine 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.230
 and each of these stories is calling, so to speak 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.110
 another monster and we have then 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:08.610
 once jeff the killer jigsaw killer 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.020
 Strider with whirlpools Landy Hoffmann 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.020
 and a jack 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.140
 Let's call here direct jeff the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.640
 killer as we see everything is dark 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.400
 and he teleports too us there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 starts to rain 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.790
 That's a bit I do not know 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:39.540
 why I 'm just wondering how often 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:41.700
 I can attack I go for a short time 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.850
 out and in again 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.610
 maybe he will work now 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.320
 it's all over again 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.140
 we can attack him yes he would 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 we attack as well, I think or 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 Neither do I have any idea how 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 but usually attacks forces 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.509
 a relaxed 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.399
 and there goes the thumb and that was already 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.810
 times the first manger fits there then 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.420
 Let's turn it on again I can 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.130
 unfortunately not in creative mode then 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.530
 somehow the game with me I say 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.870
 I have no idea why 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 next we have yes if we have the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.130
 Here could call such a small one 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.090
 motors the fishers can us straight 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.940
 somehow not attack 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.049
 Well, that's better, we do not get that way 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.209
 useless the iec came indeed fact yes because we 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.410
 the hunks pressure the meat what 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.420
 a bit disgusting is he good at you 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.670
 do nothing 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.940
 In any case, we'll have a look here 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.820
 next the smile but the shit yes 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.350
 from that one gets a proper damage 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.959
 and we almost become blind like here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.350
 alliance and still that this is the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.650
 everything is so wobbly has already fist thick 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.260
 I would like to say behind the ears 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.620
 why pull to talk a little bit about 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.970
 The two of us want to down here so 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.650
 well let's wait until the blinking 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.940
 gone is i could also drink milk 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.940
 but unfortunately I do not feel like it 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.690
 soja next we want to go here 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.230
 yes thick the power somehow nothing 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.590
 we can just kill them like that and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.920
 she has doped a flower jaja that will 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.980
 so hardly ever need so way off with it 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.910
 next we will kick it 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.790
 is also friendly to us though 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.990
 I have a big problem with it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.190
 those of you can go to the 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.990
 actually ride 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.060
 Of course I could show that now 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.280
 but then I come from next to fish 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 no longer down I have no idea 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.310
 how to get down then you can 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.570
 can one with right click easily 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.740
 like a pig, you can get it 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.000
 ride but then you do not come anymore 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.070
 I had to go down here already 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.600
 when new world which make the world new 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.550
 load and something does not help 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.770
 you just do not come from the fish 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.930
 more down well in any case can the 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.520
 ride and the thing is there 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.940
 that was why you were undefeated 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.950
 never again from the well down well 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.400
 Let's get the next run here 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.170
 and that 's good so it's that's close 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 how is he of spongebob her ? 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.070
 thaddaeus but that is exactly what is with 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.140
 right click it will be like this 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.250
 bit yes gray misplaced the color and 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.160
 then sometime the hands in the air 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.020
 and you just crazy yamaga as 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.990
 next country we do the sport 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.370
 First everything was dark and we were 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.310
 so fucking get fucking effect yes and 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.300
 we are getting slow 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.300
 I hope we get it here now 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.400
 last because oh you shit yes if I do 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.740
 when I push that we go backwards 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.240
 then he runs forward when i run 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.400
 press that he runs forward 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.370
 rather backwards is funny I hope 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.350
 we'll get killed so easily if 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.090
 I'm shit on everyone then 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.650
 Then everything will be dark 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.100
 effect occurs as we have just seen 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.840
 to have 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.220
 I could also talk about that 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.889
 let beat and want to show 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.349
 but that is that 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:20.580
 okay i forgot us 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:23.659
 recognizes with soy well dies countries 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.159
 yes there is nothing countries mentalist countries yes 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.629
 just seems like a little homage ans 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.629
 to be countries 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.710
 well i do not know if dates 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.759
 I'm not invincible now 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.379
 just read 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.379
 but he only goes for the nuts 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:45.600
 as a fix we have to have one and yes 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.510
 this is a guy that floats here 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.190
 now it's about age countries here 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:57.050
 andy I mean one of the 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:02.190
 Of course crisis fits what he nor 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.870
 yes the body would have yes that's it 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.460
 is just im without christoph muth is 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.460
 to know it almost undefeated at the 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.420
 So maybe with a bow and arrow though 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.080
 I actually ask myself visually 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.810
 disappear 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.900
 i was so full oh i was peaceful 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.900
 that's why they know who they are with yes 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.140
 that explains some things he can do well 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.060
 I did not do anything a bit 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.740
 In any case, you just do it with it 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.510
 nothing great doing that 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:36.420
 that is simply against it for young 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:40.170
 just back in the gravel of mut yes 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.040
 because there is another and everything 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.410
 quickly 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.110
 He comes when you are normal 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.450
 with a lid like pasta and just play 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.320
 when you go to sleep then it is there 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.270
 almost in front of you and then applies to you why 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.100
 do not you go last 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:06.240
 the air returns so well have the 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:09.480
 we healed the one yes and the one 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.420
 checks the sport also random so in the 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.920
 forests yes it we have again the 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.510
 sbornaja I do not know if you have the 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.370
 but can definitely use it 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.920
 a few more items that jeff smith 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.870

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.990
 cellars normal live that we can then 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.210
 probably from the killer lady gap 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.740
 Risks like forces with three leaves 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.450
 then we have pasta which we can too 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:35.250
 the forces that measure and stefano who 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.610
 knows who will know what to do with 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:42.060
 stefano has her friends on me 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.890
 Hope you liked the pasta with 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.289
