disappointment to me but I is I think

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.390 
disappointment to me but I is I think
it's<00:02:43.799> because<00:02:43.980> i<00:02:44.430> use<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.120> NYX<00:02:45.510> jumbo<00:02:45.810> pencil

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's because i use the NYX jumbo pencil

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.309 
it's because i use the NYX jumbo pencil
instead<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.640> using<00:02:47.939> an<00:02:48.209> actual<00:02:48.420> eye<00:02:48.870> shadow
