the crackle app
my<00:04:22.150> basic<00:04:22.449> thing<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.350> just<00:04:23.979> make<00:04:24.280> sure<00:04:24.490> that

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
my basic thing is just make sure that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.430 
my basic thing is just make sure that
you're<00:04:24.970> in<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.210> good<00:04:25.389> Wi-Fi<00:04:25.780> connection<00:04:26.259> at<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
you're in a good Wi-Fi connection at the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.409 
you're in a good Wi-Fi connection at the
time<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.370> Wi-Fi<00:04:27.699> connection<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:28.210> stable

time that the Wi-Fi connection is stable

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.510 
time that the Wi-Fi connection is stable
