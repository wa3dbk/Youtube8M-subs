00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 hey here is norman i want you guys 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.220
 show how much water I drink 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 always start the day with a liter 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.849
 distilled water mostly with something 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.639
 own powder and then I drink during the day 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 maybe another half liter 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.070
 and then another big sprout 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.710
 salad that is refreshed and therefore too 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.930
 much water still contains the ranges 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.890
 completely out 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 it is important that the water has 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.359
 Pollutant-free is why I drink 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.000
 only distilled water most 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.910
 water filter that is not everything 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.469
 It is important that the water only in one 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.890
 glass container also caught again 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.940
 will put me in harm's way 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.710
 plastic container from ppa or here the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.550
 drinking bottle is made of titanium it also has 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.870
 pretty light and not as heavy as 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 glass and contains no harmful 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 dpa most people are simple 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.410
 Constantly dehydrated by too 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.799
 many finished products mainly on salt 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:11.130
 and sugar or on the whole 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:15.240
 drinks from coffee or alcohol 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 whole sugar drinks dehydrate us 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 they drain more water than we do 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 give us 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.640
 also who has too many sweet fruits the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.409
 lots of sugar with a lot of water 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 dilute 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.380
 because the body then demands formally 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.909
 So it's water for digestion 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.970
 it really important enough too 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.150
 drink and you can too much 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 drink 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.860
 who only fast now pure water 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.689
 also plays essential 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.869
 Nutrients from his body therefore 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.130
 I recommend only green juice fast where 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.009
 all of us at the same time 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.409
 absorb essential nutrients and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.020
 at the same time relieve our digestion 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.330
 Most are so much raw food at the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.420
 still not used to at the beginning and 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.190
 fast with green juices and let 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 our digestion is enormous, and so are we 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.370
 Need low fiber, of course 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.880
 with raw food we take enough 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.980
 fiber on then ours too 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.720
 Build muscle then everything 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.670
 to digest properly 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.910
 Also good for digesting that's why enough 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 to drink fiber rich to eat 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.960
 It does it with raw food automatically and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.450
 even before some vip move so without 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.720
 We can not move properly either 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.120
 digest and just eat relaxed 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.030
 that is very important in mine 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.790
 For example, I had an early start 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.459
 extremely drunk but extremely little 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 nutrients I had then 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.060
 maybe an iceberg lettuce as one 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.250
 whole meal 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.760
 it is far too little is mainly 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.300
 only what is good but we can 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.220
 do not live on it or live in it 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 supermarket or health food stores is 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.050
 fresh that very crucial than ever 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.209
 earlier the more nutrient-rich therefore 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.470
 I usually need a big one 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.040
 sprouted meal 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.320
 because that even grows in the mouth far 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.989
 or who should gather wild herbs the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.060
 then immediately in the mouth stuck and me 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.980
 leave it lying around for days and days 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.760
 As a result, they lose again extremely 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.760
 many nutrients
