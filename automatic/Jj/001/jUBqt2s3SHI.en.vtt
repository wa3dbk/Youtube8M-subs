for<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.100> last<00:03:18.310> step<00:03:18.580> we're<00:03:18.790> going<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:18.970> make

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
for the last step we're going to make

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.970 
for the last step we're going to make
holes<00:03:19.450> for<00:03:19.540> ventilation<00:03:19.660> we're<00:03:20.650> gonna<00:03:20.739> put

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
holes for ventilation we're gonna put

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.370 
holes for ventilation we're gonna put
three<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> bottom<00:03:21.760> here<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.239> then<00:03:22.989> one<00:03:23.230> up

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
three in the bottom here and then one up

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.740 
three in the bottom here and then one up

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
here and another over here

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.420 
here and another over here
so<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.830> end<00:03:26.950> up<00:03:27.010> looking<00:03:27.400> like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
so it's going to end up looking like
