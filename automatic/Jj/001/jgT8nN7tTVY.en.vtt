guys<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:32.700> it's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
guys think about this I think it's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
guys think about this I think it's
notable<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.900> said<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
notable because like I said it's the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.200 
notable because like I said it's the
only<00:01:34.829> ranked<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.579> requires<00:01:35.909> two

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
only ranked one that requires two

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
only ranked one that requires two
monsters<00:01:36.659> instead<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.079> three<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.770> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
monsters instead of three you know so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.830 
monsters instead of three you know so
that<00:01:38.220> does<00:01:38.850> make<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.240> lot<00:01:39.390> easier<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.659> bring

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that does make it a lot easier to bring

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240 
that does make it a lot easier to bring
out<00:01:39.960> than<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> other<00:01:40.409> rincones<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.159> out

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
out than the other rincones that are out

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.520 
out than the other rincones that are out
there<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:42.329> does<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:43.079> nice<00:01:43.259> like

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
