00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.219
 Now kisser canoe another drain 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.339
 that brings problems and that sometimes and they do not fear 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.679
 the beauty of these riverside populations and in the state of Jalisco and 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.329
 in other states we have the famous legends 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.749
 here in the background we are seeing the boats of the fishermen 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.220
 they no longer fish 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.340
 but let's go back a few years ago 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.210
 when this lake was not so polluted 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.720
 when I saw many species of fish because here there were quite a few species 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.590
 as it happened in chapala 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.030
 now at that time 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.290
 that was the shining here in cajititlan 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.260
 that the fishermen left 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.670
 in good seasons even to bring their products because there was not a legend missing 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.300
 Legend of the witch 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.070
 the legend of the witch tell 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.520
 one day they made this witch mad 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.380
 and they try to make it run to such a degree that it ran and has been done 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.850
 flattery 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.180
 but as a witch she managed to survive under the waters of the lake 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.880
 turning the courage that the target and has moved from here to cajititlan and that 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.960
 nobody wanted her 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.710
 his revenge 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.830
 according to the legend that when fishermen in good times came out and 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.340
 they took trust arraya full of fish in many occasions these felt very 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.500
 heavy and started excited to pull the face to the calahorra 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.240
 and what was his surprise 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.860
 that instead of being weighed by the amount of fish that would have caught 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.899
 they were quantities of stones that the witch threw at them and sometimes they were so many that 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.610
 when they clogged that mayan blood truth or those networks were broken by everything 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.070
 This product of the witch of Lake CajititlÃ¡n 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.430
 what a beautiful legend pity that now I believe that the witch can not stand 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.490
 in the waters and less when in the presidency as he was tremendous 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.640
 at this moment and believe me I wanted to finish quickly to relate this 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.700
 story because I did not set it aside anymore let's continue 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.349
 then root that the project was implemented 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.359
 the population remains a new physiognomy 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.409
 cease 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.279
 building a boardwalk 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.869
 but nevertheless 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.999
 how much is normal 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.029
 this water plan 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.499
 that street vito surrounding baskets 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.889
 the water comes from road points 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.889
 a large flow so much I do not see a catchment system 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.620
 that makes it possible to be quiet and street a few pictures flood us because it springs 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.649
 the drains 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.329
 including the houses 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.119
 solid waste 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:02.839
 here there was 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.799
 a natural decline 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.999
 and the water went out without any problem but good stacks of euros corp 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.819
 one 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 once again we have reached the end of another program 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.519
 from to lagoon 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.589
 and I hope you liked it 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.590
 There are some critics but that before these critics 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.879
 they are constructive because because we must see keeping everything for the good of the 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.660
 humanity 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.520
 and more in each population 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.179
 where we have a lacustrine glass of this nature 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.819
 I do not want to retire without first inviting you to once again 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.040
 suggestion 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.300
 that they have percent either destructive constructive criticism again 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.430
 appears here in our email was going to look like a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.230

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.880

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.610

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.590

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.390
 delicious of which 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.370
 Well, I can not stop 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.580
 I confess that I am very weak and I liked it 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:28.629
 after taking two picon sitos but one of them wolf and is divided into 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:34.539
 two parts in order to whom the cameraman today in our producer
