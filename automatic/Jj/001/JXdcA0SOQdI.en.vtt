the blade that comes out of this handle
is<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.970> surprising<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> blade

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is kind of surprising you know the blade

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.820 
is kind of surprising you know the blade
looks<00:02:17.849> as<00:02:18.269> long<00:02:19.050> as<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> handle<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.680> not

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
looks as long as the handle if not

longer you're somehow which it's not but
you<00:02:22.800> know<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.160> appears<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.879> be<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.680> one

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
you know it appears to be and that's one

of<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> things<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.670> drew<00:02:27.060> me<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
of the things that really drew me in the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.009 
of the things that really drew me in the
blade<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.920> handle<00:02:29.250> ratio<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.660> really<00:02:30.900> got

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
blade to handle ratio is what really got

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.750 
blade to handle ratio is what really got
me<00:02:31.080> interested<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.620> knife<00:02:31.830> plus<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.640> was

shape<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.489> reverse<00:02:42.209> tanto<00:02:43.940> definitely<00:02:44.940> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
shape the reverse tanto definitely a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.740 
shape the reverse tanto definitely a
great<00:02:45.180> blade<00:02:45.450> shape<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:47.569> figure<00:02:48.569> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
great blade shape it is I figure it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.300 
great blade shape it is I figure it's
called<00:02:48.959> what's<00:02:49.170> flat<00:02:49.410> ground<00:02:49.739> from<00:02:50.069> pretty

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
called what's flat ground from pretty

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.960 
called what's flat ground from pretty
much<00:02:50.400> three<00:02:50.670> quarters<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> knife<00:02:51.329> down

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
much three quarters of the knife down

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.880 
much three quarters of the knife down
the<00:02:53.970> grind<00:02:54.299> pretty<00:02:54.989> much<00:02:55.170> splits<00:02:55.650> that

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the grind pretty much splits that

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.589 
the grind pretty much splits that
benchmade<00:02:56.519> butterfly<00:02:56.910> which<00:02:57.180> you've<00:02:57.329> seen

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
benchmade butterfly which you've seen

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.259 
benchmade butterfly which you've seen
its<00:02:58.290> kind<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.620> got<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.769> switch<00:02:59.160> up<00:02:59.519> top<00:02:59.790> or<00:03:00.090> I

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
its kind of got a switch up top or I

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.509 
its kind of got a switch up top or I
guess<00:03:01.110> that's<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.530> call<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.829> with

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
guess that's what you can call it with

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.990 
guess that's what you can call it with
