00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.170
 Now we will demonstrate the replacement racks 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.900
 stabilizer on the Renault Logan and the front 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.240
 rear there is not to unscrew 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.420
 be sure to clean the threaded 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.420
 part 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.200
 otherwise there will be problems 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.650
 The idea is to keep 40 on top 40 and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.600
 but most often it looks like this 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:01:04.269
 holding the gas key and unscrew 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:01:08.990
 nuts extract began not we see that 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.630
 stabilizer struts already in the first she 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.360
 snuggles the second wears off 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.450
 rubber part here and the bolt starts 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.190
 beat and wharf we see poverty 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.990
 we use stabilizer firms 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.820
 sasic 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.730
 they more or less fit the category 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.500
 price-quality should also be noted when 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.260
 strong from my stabilizer 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.860
 happens break the landing part in 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.420
 lever 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 if you have holes uneven circle a 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.010
 already acquired an oval-shaped lever better 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 replace as stabilizer struts 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.540
 very often will come out 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.040
 what are good sasic stabilizers 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.740
 all that they have the length of the threaded part 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:21.770
 can be baited without any other 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:24.380
 tools by the time enough to 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.650
 appeal the stabilizer struts with both 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 become
