00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.920
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.760
 greet you with me in the channel to a 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.160
 new review this time the book of magic 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.160
 drink a new hiking book game 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.269
 with book of books of potions 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.780
 we put our education in hogwarts 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.070
 school of witchcraft and magic fort the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.430
 travel leads us over one 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.059
 mysterious magical garden in the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.559
 we dangerous obstacles exciting 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.199
 to overcome challenges 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 in the fight to find the golden kettle 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.699
 Let's see if we drank a true one 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.699
 be a champion 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.119
 the graphic is very successful the 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.549
 animation effects environment and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.500
 backgrounds really do that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.289
 Feeling like a true potion brewer 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.390
 will be in the respective tasks 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.469
 always different scenes and tunes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 to see figures 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.170
 always new ingredients new ways 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.170
 then make this potion 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.390
 everything changes sometimes 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.189
 Repeat on things but not 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.189
 so it gets boring 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.080
 The voice of Siegmund Butch explains 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.360
 us all in a very pleasant 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:56.090
 she is cheerful and funny as well 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.159
 the sound effects and sounds are very 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.920
 realistic and put us well in that 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.710
 no matter whether the kettle blood samples 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.119
 really nice and then we come out 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.830
 just in the video looks behind me 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.989
 use when the scissors has been making 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.830
 also this typical cerny slide 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.150
 or if we use the bellows around 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.550
 to cheer the boiler 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.830
 because time makes this bellows 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.660
 made as real as a leather 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.730
 noises so if you really and everyone 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.739
 used a bellows and the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.230
 Optimized the air a bit 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.410
 you go down there and flowers 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.150
 from the boiler we say and the fire 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.799
 everything is very realistic is really good 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.799
 made and great fun 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.180
 the gameplay is very easy and will 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.790
 also very great explained 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.769
 different tools not just one 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.250
 magic wand, for example, in a stirring spoon 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.130
 Magnifying glass or scissors the magic wand 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.410
 we do not just need to be at the end of one 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.360
 a certain magic movement 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.000
 which always changes so 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.430
 Every potion is different to carry out no 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.440
 we also need it for the ingredients in 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.690
 to make the potion then we still have 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.180
 a rebuke 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.769
 you have to go slow with that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.650
 stir the potion 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.049
 It's different from drinking to drink 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.079
 and Siegmund explains it very well to us 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.140
 then we have a magnifying glass around things 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.660
 to investigate zoom in and the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.269
 partly from a particular ingredient to 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.239
 example, better to investigate more closely 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.720
 for example, the leaves my 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.360
 come or sometimes so small hook or 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.799
 or barb that spikes on 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.870
 certain things are tuned 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.670
 it always depends and if we 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.920
 then have studied enough and all 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.900
 details of this ingredient found out 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.670
 have and what we need 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.569
 Let's just take the scissors 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:02.190
 Example and cutting of the ingredients 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.989
 for example leaves or walls 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.060
 to need the crown or the clean 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.720
 you can sting with scissors because 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.720
 cut off 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.670
 the atmosphere in the book of magic potions 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.060
 is like in the first part of the book 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.920
 magic spells successfully implemented 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.100
 you sit tied up in front of it and feel 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.310
 like a real brew brewer apprentice 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.770
 Ingredients search examine in cutting 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.260
 cheer the kettle and cheer 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.590
 in the end, drink the potion with a spell 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.710
 Movement of his staff activate this 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.920
 It is easy to use them 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.310
 Huge fun and time flies like in the 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.310
 fluge 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.789
 the book of magic potions is a 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.439
 captivating experience for young and old 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.589
 It's not just for Harry Potter fans 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.369
 everyone thinks of the game 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.580
 have fun 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:06.679
 It has succeeded in captivating and 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.779
 exciting by the beautiful and 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:11.419
 Arousing atmosphere makes you feel 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:14.059
 as in hogwarts, it's a real trend 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.089
 brewer apprentice going through everything 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:19.580
 just needs to get wonderful from me 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:23.749
 It's a buy recommendation and a lot 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:28.099
 Good 3 so that was it with the review 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:29.599
 to book the magic drink I hope I 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.159
 could help you something you could 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.849
 a little insight into the game 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.919
 betray 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.319
 I really just tried to give it away 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.269
 to take the things initially not to 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.239
 much to betray you still 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:43.159
 could have fun at the game 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:45.579
 This is where micha houses say goodbye 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.579
