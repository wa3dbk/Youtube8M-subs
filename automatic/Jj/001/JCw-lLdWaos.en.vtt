00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello to all and good day to everything here 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 a new pc presentation video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.830
 gamer so this time we leave for a pc 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.370
 entry-level gamer of first price 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.100
 to be able to play video games on pc 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.260
 without necessarily breaking the bank 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020
 regards the components like processor 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 I chose a processor from amd 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.300
 so the amd phenom ii x4 965 black 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.760
 edition 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 so it's a processor that does not cost 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.930
 not very expensive and at 80.3 euros you 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.700
 can find it cheaper it's a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.850
 processor that has four hearts 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.180
 clocked at 3 4 giguere this compatible 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.760
 socket am2 plus m3 and m4 plus which 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 gives us the choice of a large number of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.579
 motherboards for the motherboard i 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 took a motherboard asrock 970 proulx 3 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.340
 so with a more compatible am3 socket 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.590
 with our processor in tea format xx 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.350
 she has four ram slots in 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.170
 ddr3 an audio output hd in 7.1 so 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 useful for listening to good music 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.799
 quality and for games also she 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.920
 has two USB ports 3 at output 6 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.930
 sata 3 2 pci express in 2.0 x 16 and the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 card is crossfire compatible 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.720
 regarding ram I chose 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.259
 two memory sticks of 2 gigabytes 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.570
 ddr3 from corsair so privateers 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.570
 revenge you are wrong on the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.450
 reference are the pc12800 caste 9 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 you will find the picture easily 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.049
 not deceive it's this one that I have 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.060
 so choose are two memory sticks 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.960
 2 gigas each for a total of 4 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.649
 gigas of ram clocked at 1600 megahertz and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.270
 on the site where I found them 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.430
 are guaranteed for life so what is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.670
 not negligible as a hard drive I 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.939
 chose the seagate barracuda in 7200 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.700
 laps for a total of 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.590
 storage so a small hard drive that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.000
 more than enough for 60 euros 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.520
 it's the bare minimum 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.670
 to you to see and so again 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.070
 I make you wait patiently so 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.930
 graphic card i chose an asus 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.840
 radeon hd 6790 overclocked so from home 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.890
 asus under direct cu2 so their own 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.150
 cooling system which according to 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.340
 what they say cooled very well 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.310
 personally I have not tested so 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.410
 a small graphic card that is enough 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 amply 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.270
 this configuration me I wait 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.440
 frankly to see the ps4 and the xbox 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.750
 one to action but for the total price 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.230
 of the configuration I prefer to have that 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.630
 rather than a ps4 xbox one after debate 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.520
 we do not care the graphics card 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.510
 she and a PCI Express 3.0 that's good 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:11.100
 the gpu of the card is clocked at 1075 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.780
 megahertz the oar as for it is to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.600
 1640 megahertz so a gig of ram 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.090
 she has two exits dvi a 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.390
 hdmi output and a mini output 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.970
 displayport and so to power everything 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 I chose a big diet 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.480
 430 watts pure power l8 wiotte 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.850
 certified 80plus bronze which is 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.090
 modular is so-called ultra 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.420
 silent is essential or not the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.680
 dvd player so from samsung first 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.890
 price at 14 euros 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.130
 and finally to contain all his 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.829
 components I chose the zalman z11 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.140
 more so a box of first prices 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.739
 which is still of good quality 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.170
 good bill because I have them myself 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.600
 does not make a lot of noise 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.130
 some I see comments that 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.980
 say 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.040
 who is not tip top but I am 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.250
 I am very satisfied with this case 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:16.650
 so in front before it has 2 usb 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.720
 3.0 what is a plus anyway and at 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.450
 maximum there can be seven 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.240
 basic fans provided there are some 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.520
 five or six I do not remember too much and 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.830
 you can add some years 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.110
 in total of an ascetic that ventilates very 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.990
 well and so little recap of the 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.170
 price so for processors 83 euros the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.390
 ram 43 euros the motherboard 63 euros that 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.420
 does a lot of 3 graphics card 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:46.740
 117 euros the food 65 euros the 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:51.210
 hard drive 60 euros the case 56 euros 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.080
 and the player dvd burner 14 euros this 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.370
 which makes us a total of 51 euros and 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.050
 I could have added as the last 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.860
 fans but that's at 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.410
 you to see 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.290
 saw that there are only 2 added 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.330
 normally and so I intervene in the end 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.120
 of video to tell you also that the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.330
 folds are not quite accurate because 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.630
 following the time the promotions all that 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.150
 prices may vary from some 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.730
 components like the graphics card 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.950
 two weeks ago i did i 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.690
 chose the pictures the components all that 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.480
 she was 117 euros 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.640
 and there she is at 140 euros on 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.180
 materiel.net where 144 euros 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.040
 because there is the game bioshock infinite 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.410
 offered it is not so offered that it's seen 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.700
 that he adds 30 euros in the price I 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.430
 do not know why they did that but 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.560
 good wait a little bit you go 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.060
 see it goes quickly down if we do 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.370
 like me, do not hesitate to buy 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.110
 used components personally to 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.090
 every time it works very well I have not 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.740
 full 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.690
 if you watch this video really 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.200
 really really later than the xbox 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.940
 one and the ps4 and already came out I think 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.800
 that prices will have dropped again 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.910
 so do not hesitate do some 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 changes for that price there in the east 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.510
 between 500 and 600 euros 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.940
 it's really worth it even if there is 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.680
 maybe things to edit 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.990
 I know you'll tell me in 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.510
 the comments I'm always 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.840
 taker to give me ideas all that 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.420
 tell me where I should go 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.250
 maybe component level so that's it 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.470
 everything come on the farm for you 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.420
 say that too do not hesitate to go see 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.040
 my other videos so I tell you 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.040
 shock everyone and see you next time
