of 29 my freezer so i think that looks
pretty<00:03:39.690> looks<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.870> nectarine<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.590> honey

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
pretty looks like nectarine and honey

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.740 
pretty looks like nectarine and honey
but<00:03:44.730> anyway<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:45.880> getting<00:03:45.970> back<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.359> soaping
