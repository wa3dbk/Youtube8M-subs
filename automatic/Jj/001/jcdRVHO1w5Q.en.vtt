00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.360
 hey I'm sacchi and in this rubric 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.309
 i would like to ask the answer to me 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 been put by my audience 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.929
 and this time it's about that again 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.570
 theme campfire because the Christian has 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.060
 I asked for your video answer 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 which firewood is suitable I have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.590
 there is still a deeper question 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 also types of wood one for a fire 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 I should avoid thinking, for example 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 mangled wood or poisonous wood like 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.570
 by eibe robinie golden rain or 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.079
 holly yes christian you speak 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.390
 Your question yes my video on the subject of how 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.590
 real firewood can be found at the information 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.090
 Of course, if I do not do that now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 repeat who cares 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 Just below in the video 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 I'll look at that description 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 post link then you have already 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.309
 so the most common woods enumerated there 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.609
 was there roubini holly and holly 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.149
 laburnum 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.450
 you could still count to that 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.150
 grape-cherry lazy-skinned 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.299
 and most importantly the tree of life 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 also a very poisonous but I own 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.840
 can give a total warning so 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 In my opinion, it does not matter 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 this wood to be burned arise 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.700
 no no special toxic fumes 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 which is not recommended 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 would it be the wood ash then too 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.689
 use or the coal around any 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 bush makes techniques to make like 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.540
 eg brushing your teeth or something like that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.270
 I would then let it be because you me 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 personally do not know how many of the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 toxins there maybe or 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.450
 then still be contained 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 could be worthy of that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.439
 otherwise there are some woods of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.320
 which the duh have enumerated even 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.500
 really good burn times very short 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.899
 So, what are you talking about so halfway for 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.610
 by the way, it does not apply to herbs 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.180
 There are quite a few herbs that will be out 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.100
 fire puts there are already special 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.950
 a special smoke with ingredients 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.020
 that can be toxic to us 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 that became even earlier in some 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.590
 rituals of certain people great 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.390
 then they have herbs 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.739
 burned for example 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.739
 intoxicate or something like that then should 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.010
 you still know that the smoke is one 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.810
 Fire is always poisonous 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.150
 no matter what wood is mainly used for 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.190
 For example, when the beech wood when you 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.500
 sitting in a fire or at a barbecue 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.659
 or something you should never do 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.560
 inhale much of this smoke that is 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.060
 not good for your lungs 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.760
 Everyone knows that, for example 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.900
 so a small fire training course at the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.690
 has made firefighters or something like that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.940
 Overall, the smoke is a fire 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.560
 always poisonous but of the listed 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.510
 he is not that toxic now 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.819
 somehow especially poisonous that me 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.829
 that you are particularly worried about that 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.480
 would have to do or something like the danger 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.299
 a poisoning exists in something like that 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.599
 only if you have plant parts to yourself 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.450
 takes then you still had to ask 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.069
 fungus the wood and it is just as you 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.750
 ver can mushroom wood just 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.109
 there is nothing burning as well 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.980
 special though if that's too 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:24.230
 rotten to soft wood is then worthwhile 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.579
 This does not really burn 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.230
 because it's just very bad 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.370
 burns and is also the energy value 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.980
 pretty bad you have to be pretty 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.030
 a lot in the campfire in his yard or 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.190
 whatever packing 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.209
 until finally the desired 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.160
 result comes out 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.129
 that does not burn so well that best 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.840
 leave out completely and if you are so right 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.579
 Pissed the wood has where white thus 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.410
 mold then something like that is 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.660
 rather a sign that the wood 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.250
 is still pretty wet and then suitable 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.579
 it does not burn to death anyway 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.879
 ok, I hope that helped 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.780
 Well 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.780
 Until next time
