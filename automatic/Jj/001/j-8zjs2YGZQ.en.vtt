00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.520
 around the new physics of the movement of tanks 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.370
 already a huge amount 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.090
 different opinions both positive and 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.940
 negative assumptions and the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.160
 things like that but all this one 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.199
 swoop take and abolish wargaming 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.449
 just took and opened the test server 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.249
 on which everyone could enter 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.800
 downloaded for starters download clients 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.840
 then come in and try it yourself 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.840
 This is the very physics of motion. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.150
 tanks and immediately start with a bad t-62 and 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.880
 50100 there are moving well, to put it mildly, not 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.070
 very good but immediately follows 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.170
 good news because wargaming 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.420
 officially said that so 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.430
 they will not move, and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.110
 specific tanks will be before 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.140
 tune up therefore in advance 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.060
 you shouldn't get upset but now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.150
 let's get to the bottom line 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.250
 This physics represents the very first thing 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.530
 felt on the plus or minus heavy tanks 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.799
 which weigh but more than 20 tons 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.229
 This is what they have in management appeared 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.840
 inertia mass that is when you 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.579
 you start a tank IS-3 apt-1 you 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.249
 You feel that you do not ride on 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.259
 bolide on some cars now 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.460
 the engine needs some time to 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.280
 to push 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.469
 this whole huge mass is the same with 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.049
 braking is the same with turns about 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.759
 whom we talk a bit longer all 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.469
 This means that such maneuvers as 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.289
 rocker will become well a little bit less 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.719
 fast at the same time well for example 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.329
 my feelings too when you drive through 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.639
 some obstacles such as fences 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.289
 such as trees you are most likely 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.270
 will not lose speed and by extremely 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.960
 As it is my feeling maybe I 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.889
 I am mistaken 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.049
 about turns what i said now 

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:56.719
 droplet recycled by themselves in 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.369
 turn and imagine the situation in by 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.950
 the old fashioned way when you need to log in 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.189
 as fast as you turn 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.959
 key w and a or d depending on 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.270
 the direction to turn well 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.700
 I have yes on the keyboard keys now 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.290
 the same trick 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.970
 implemented a little bit differently if you 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 will rotate like the old fashioned way 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.590
 i mean for compressed gas and turn keys 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.840
 almost no speed will be lost with 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.469
 those mean your actual speed 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.329
 if you pinch before entering 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.730
 w and travels at a speed of 35 kilometers per hour 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.200
 at the exit you will go almost with 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.439
 same speed plus minus there 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.909
 a couple of Komi per hour however the trajectory 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.400
 on which you will pass this turn 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.370
 will be as wide as possible and for 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.870
 urban conditions this is unacceptable because 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.750
 now in order to do 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.909
 quickest turn with 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.669
 as fast as possible angular speed 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.370
 you need to at least lower the key 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:56.519
 gas in this case the speed will be 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.590
 lose more but at the same time and speed 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.349
 which you turn will also be more 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.439
 in order to maximize the corner 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.129
 speed and minimize your 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.989
 real 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.150
 you will need to press now 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.530
 space key which is now 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.889
 hand brake 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.439
 I want to note for themselves that 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.359
 as needed go to 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.709
 On an ongoing basis, you will need to use it. 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.889
 only on heavy tanks 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.889
 on tanks like 1390 and even more so on 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.500
 just enough to let the Christmas tree gas itself 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.750
 then the tank rotates very briskly 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.720
 but at the same time it is practically not demolished 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.970
 clamping a space is already more about 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.519
 extreme but i think you will feel it already 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.620
 yourself when you ride this physics 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.989
 not to mention that now with 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.239
 entering this very hand brake 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.590
 you have the opportunity to make such feints 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.659
 like a police turn 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.060
 such as yours goes any where 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.370
 tank you need to turn on it sharply 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.970
 and make him a shot for example you on 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.919
 Christmas tree 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.109
 for example someone is chasing you 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.479
 make a turn and and your opponent when 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.609
 this being shot you give it to you 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.829
 generally well done now can do 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.229
 in its own turn in general movie well yes 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.790
 okay another chip has become more 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:11.519
 smooth suspension operation 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.509
 most clearly seen for example on 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.400
 rails that is if earlier we went for a drive 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:19.680
 driving rails for example on ensk on 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.690
 Himmelsdorf our tank after all 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.300
 shook it now even on such 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.240
 tanks like 1390 virtually no 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.849
 there is a swing of swinging and sight that 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.429
 to speak about such monsters as of 3 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.949
 now driving on rails it is very 

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:36.689
 small event while even on 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.649
 border and yet your tank will 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.459
 wiggle 

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:44.909
 but it is not as global as that 

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:47.879
 that now such tanks are kind of like a needle 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.919
 can pass well almost everywhere on 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.959
 such maps as mines robin for 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.169
 players open previously unseen 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:58.439
 heats positions and it's all about 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.119
 now the tank has expanded its range 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.129
 places where he can, in principle, be himself 

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:04.769
 pick up for example in mines 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.869
 even now, at such a tank as the tree does not 

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:09.089
 be sure to drive through the center with 

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:11.819
 one of the risks where the balcony is 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.749
 for trash can you just by 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.849
 their bases 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:18.179
 directly almost through the wall 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.519
 drive to the central hill or to 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:22.379
 island where the lighthouse is located on tanks with 

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.569
 solid towers can take one 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.550
 interesting position where you can 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.169
 shoot off not too experienced players 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.539
 at the word what's natural against you is not 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.209
 plays art which is not difficult 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.219
 you shoot what is true now the question 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:37.589
 is the following in my opinion 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:40.169
 some positions some races 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.699
 well frankly imbalance on and 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.249
 now before entering 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.619
 on the basis of this physics to developers 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.649
 will have to reconsider but almost all 

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:52.649
 card in this game inside and out in order to 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:55.499
 up to balance all those very races 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:58.050
 all those same passages that some more 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.759
 here's the physics but i hope that everything 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.159
 will be done at the highest level 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.619
 one more thing that was finally 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.709
 introduced is the ability to turn 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:10.110
 a tank when one of its tracks is shot down 

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:12.179
 The question is that this chip for some reason 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.029
 implemented only in the tank then 44 

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:17.729
 maybe some more but I noticed 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.610
 only on it that is t-54 when shot down 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.679
 this sky is all 2 was not but what 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.449
 it finally appeared it to my 

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:27.029
 look good very plus now at least 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.039
 it will be possible to tuck the body under the pain 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:31.379
 more favorable angle then when your 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.809
 tank repaired and another problem 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.669
 which I noticed in this physics is 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.719
 that under water for some reason, the tank would generally 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.449
 does not lose speed 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.370
 Well, well, do not lose at all, that is, and at least 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.420
 under water at a speed of 60 kilometers an hour 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.700
 yes easily 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.240
 drive on a robin across an island 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.430
 which is from the cowsheds t-54 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.810
 easier than ever and still somehow 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.570
 cruise control has also been implemented 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.950
 pretty weird maybe just 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.740
 some parameter so far 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.870
 set up oh well all the firm is 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.620
 the very first test to talk about something 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.740
 Seriously 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.350
 in my opinion it's pretty stupid so what 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.870
 we have in the bottom line if you omit 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.090
 all the problems that are inherent 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.220
 the very first test in my opinion 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.770
 new movement physics of tanks and this 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.050
 really something new because but 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.290
 I increasingly hear these types of reviews 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.870
 as a long-patch 80 is not horrified by this 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.510
 Serious not to seriously 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.730
 would change the game on the topics you know what 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.180
 there will be quite a lot of war but now 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.400
 just the game will be another bit 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.380
 now a little more skill will be needed 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.410
 attach to manage your 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.960
 but now quite significantly 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:45.780
 expanded the range of possibilities that 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.840
 can make your tank moving along 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:52.290
 ground and not only in my opinion it 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.540
 Well, if you fix up some moments 

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:57.240
 then in my opinion this is innovation 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.070
 is very good personally i am now 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.860
 I will wait for new iterations of this test 

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.270
 Physics in order to see how much 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.070
 is progressing worked on this chip 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.780
 because to me she really 

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.780
 interesting coffee itself all good luck for now
