00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
momentum off of the floor you're really

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.090 
momentum off of the floor you're really
not<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.260> able<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> plus

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
not going to be able to do it plus

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.849 
not going to be able to do it plus
you're<00:00:59.670> unstable<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.079> could<00:01:01.260> also<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.680> them

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you're unstable you could also do them

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310 
you're unstable you could also do them
with<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.460> leg<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.930> lots<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.049> different

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
with one leg out lots of different

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
with one leg out lots of different
variations<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.460> bring<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> knee<00:01:05.939> in

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
variations here you can bring in knee in

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
variations here you can bring in knee in
it<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.080> depends<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.740> how<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.760> with

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it just depends on how good you get with

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
it just depends on how good you get with
your<00:01:09.060> stability<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> something

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
your stability and that is something

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
your stability and that is something
when<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:10.950> working<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> really

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
when you're working out that you really

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
when you're working out that you really
want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> focus<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.920> talking

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
front in the back it's all about the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.010

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to go to the floor I can put this piece

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
to go to the floor I can put this piece
of<00:01:26.040> equipment<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:27.060> underneath<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.900> legs

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and that's going to add a little bit of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.020 
and that's going to add a little bit of
weight<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.500> doing<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.009> simply<00:01:32.700> grip

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
in here is for some hamstring and maybe
combine<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.390> core<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.439> wanted<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
combine it with core so if I wanted to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.450 
combine it with core so if I wanted to
come<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.829> down<00:01:55.950> I'm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
come up and down and up and down I'm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.160 
come up and down and up and down I'm
going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> fire<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> glutes<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
going to fire up the glutes and the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
going to fire up the glutes and the
hamstrings<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.640> simply<00:02:00.030> roll<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
hamstrings and then I can simply roll it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.289 
hamstrings and then I can simply roll it
in<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> activate<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.890> core<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.909> wanted<00:02:03.210> to
