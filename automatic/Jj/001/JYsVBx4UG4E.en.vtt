00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and I can get most of it just by lifting

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.710 
and I can get most of it just by lifting
it<00:02:22.440> straight<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.860> now<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> take<00:02:23.910> my<00:02:23.970> wiggle<00:02:24.570> wire

now<00:02:29.850> then<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> lift<00:02:30.570> straight<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
now then I lift straight up like so and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.700
