00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
art changes over the course of the level

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.170 
art changes over the course of the level
right<00:01:11.620> now<00:01:11.770> it's<00:01:11.950> very<00:01:12.010> clean<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.790> well<00:01:12.940> lit

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
right now it's very clean and well lit

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.030 
right now it's very clean and well lit
and<00:01:13.240> pristine<00:01:13.870> but<00:01:14.110> as<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.380> battle<00:01:14.650> rages<00:01:14.830> on

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
and pristine but as the battle rages on

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.800 
and pristine but as the battle rages on
and<00:01:15.250> on<00:01:15.370> it's<00:01:16.090> going<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.300> get<00:01:16.390> more<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.780> more

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
and on it's going to get more and more

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.580 
and on it's going to get more and more
damaged<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.990> example<00:01:20.320> we<00:01:20.440> have

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
damaged so in for example we have

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.290 
damaged so in for example we have
integrated<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.460> lot<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.730> choreograph<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
integrated a lot of choreograph the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.240 
integrated a lot of choreograph the
winds<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.960> sandbox<00:01:23.200> experience<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.160> you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
winds in the sandbox experience so you

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.400 
winds in the sandbox experience so you
have<00:01:24.610> here<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.000> example<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.660> getting<00:01:26.290> your

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
have here for example the getting your

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.440 
have here for example the getting your
opinion<00:01:26.890> coming<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.370> which<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.300> the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
opinion coming in which is the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.470 
opinion coming in which is the
choreography<00:01:28.960> itself<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.060> important

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
choreography itself but the important

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.240 
choreography itself but the important
thing<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.720> like<00:01:32.080> unlike<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.680> typical<00:01:33.040> games

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
thing is like unlike in typical games

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.680 
thing is like unlike in typical games
where<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.670> will<00:01:33.820> be<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.000> completely<00:01:34.480> linear

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
where this will be a completely linear

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.050 
where this will be a completely linear
experience<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:36.190> player<00:01:36.490> has<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> choice<00:01:37.000> to

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
experience the player has a choice to

Nanosuit in order to survive one thing
that's<00:01:56.530> going<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.770> happen<00:01:56.830> here<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.400> we're

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
that's going to happen here is we're

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.950 
that's going to happen here is we're
going<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.030> look<00:01:58.180> around<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.510> corner<00:01:58.840> and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
going to look around the corner and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.660 
going to look around the corner and
figure<00:01:59.380> out<00:01:59.440> what<00:01:59.680> weapons<00:02:00.040> are<00:02:00.220> around<00:02:00.550> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
figure out what weapons are around the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.160 
figure out what weapons are around the
sandbox<00:02:01.120> that<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:01.360> can<00:02:01.510> use<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.659> take<00:02:01.930> out<00:02:02.050> the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
sandbox that we can use to take out the

sandbox that we can use to take out the
pinger<00:02:02.440> because<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.980> shotgun<00:02:03.370> isn't<00:02:03.640> going

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
pinger because the shotgun isn't going

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.920 
pinger because the shotgun isn't going
to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
to
on<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.680> we're<00:02:04.830> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> jump<00:02:05.190> over<00:02:05.400> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on it so we're going to jump over the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.950 
on it so we're going to jump over the
balcony<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.120> use<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> power<00:02:06.480> jump<00:02:06.870> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
balcony here and use the power jump of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.840 
balcony here and use the power jump of
the<00:02:06.990> nanosuit<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> get<00:02:07.950> across<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.399> space<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
the nanosuit to get across the space and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.680 
the nanosuit to get across the space and
survive<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.600> better<00:02:09.780> weaponry<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:12.570> I'm

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
survive and get better weaponry and I'm

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.970 
survive and get better weaponry and I'm
taking<00:02:12.840> quite<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> beating<00:02:13.500> here<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> mean

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
taking quite a beating here so I mean

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.380 
taking quite a beating here so I mean
what<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.210> use<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
what I really have to do is use the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.150 
what I really have to do is use the
powers<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.990> suit<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.410> stealth<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.950> order

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
powers of the suit like stealth in order

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.650 
powers of the suit like stealth in order
to<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.400> around<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.820> side<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> finger<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
to get around the side of the finger and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
to get around the side of the finger and
get<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> good<00:02:19.410> firing<00:02:19.680> position<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.310> order<00:02:20.520> to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
get a good firing position in order to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.800 
get a good firing position in order to
flank<00:02:20.850> him<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.240> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> hit<00:02:21.540> him<00:02:21.660> here

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
flank him so I'm going to hit him here

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
flank him so I'm going to hit him here
