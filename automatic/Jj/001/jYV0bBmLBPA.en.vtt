marshal Minnesota where those people
that<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.619> interested<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:32.399> involved<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.940> this

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that are interested or involved in this

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900 
that are interested or involved in this
were<00:00:33.870> there<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:35.219> were<00:00:35.399> sharing<00:00:35.579> some

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
were there and we were sharing some

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
were there and we were sharing some
ideas<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.989> general<00:00:37.290> consensus<00:00:37.440> back

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
ideas and the general consensus back

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.170 
ideas and the general consensus back
then<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.460> thought<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
then was we thought it was going to be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.670 
then was we thought it was going to be
very<00:00:39.329> difficult<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.110> farmers<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
very difficult to get farmers to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
very difficult to get farmers to
increase<00:00:41.129> corn<00:00:41.489> acres<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:41.940> much<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.360> everybody

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
increase corn acres as much as everybody

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.650 
increase corn acres as much as everybody
thought<00:00:44.000> since<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.510> those

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
thought since we know all those

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.240 
thought since we know all those
unplanted<00:00:46.320> wheat<00:00:46.559> acres<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> go

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
unplanted wheat acres are going to go

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
unplanted wheat acres are going to go
someplace<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> appears<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
someplace but it appears now that's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100 
someplace but it appears now that's
coming<00:00:50.160> true<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.850> mean<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.660> may<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.960> just

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
coming true so I mean this may be just

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.229 
coming true so I mean this may be just
intentions<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> farmers<00:00:53.520> obviously<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
intentions of farmers obviously and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
intentions of farmers obviously and
weather<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:55.020> certainly<00:00:55.410> play<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> role<00:00:56.010> as

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
weather will certainly play the role as

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.910 
weather will certainly play the role as
to<00:00:56.399> whether<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.570> price<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.260> into<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to whether and price going into the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
to whether and price going into the
after<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> crop<00:01:00.059> report<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> 31st<00:01:01.170> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
after that crop report on the 31st but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
after that crop report on the 31st but
at<00:01:01.890> any<00:01:02.039> rate<00:01:02.160> today<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> former<00:01:03.989> came<00:01:04.170> out

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
at any rate today and former came out

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.100 
at any rate today and former came out
with<00:01:04.589> eighty<00:01:05.010> eight<00:01:05.250> point<00:01:05.549> four<00:01:06.110> million

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
with eighty eight point four million

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.580 
with eighty eight point four million
acres<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.619> corn<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.670> compares<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.590> last

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
acres of corn and that compares to last

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
acres of corn and that compares to last
year<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> eighty<00:01:11.040> six<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> half<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.850> believe

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
year of eighty six and a half I believe

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
year of eighty six and a half I believe
but<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.510> importantly<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> compares<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but more importantly it compares to the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
but more importantly it compares to the
USDA's<00:01:14.549> februari<00:01:15.150> outlook<00:01:15.570> where<00:01:15.780> they

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
USDA's februari outlook where they

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200 
USDA's februari outlook where they
thought<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.799> would<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:16.979> 89<00:01:17.400> million<00:01:17.790> acres

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
thought there would be 89 million acres

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
thought there would be 89 million acres
and<00:01:18.420> again<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.900> februari<00:01:19.350> outlook<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> USDA

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and again the februari outlook the USDA

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.640 
and again the februari outlook the USDA
ad<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.650> USDA

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
ad was the first time there USDA

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
ad was the first time there USDA
economist<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.810> people<00:01:24.810> could<00:01:24.960> look<00:01:25.080> at

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
economist and people could look at

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
economist and people could look at
things<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> say<00:01:25.799> based<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.820> out

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
things and say based on what we see out

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.649 
things and say based on what we see out
there<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.189> trends<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.340> prices<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> selling

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
there and trends in prices and selling

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
there and trends in prices and selling
prices<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.350> forth<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.850> we

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
prices and so forth this is what we

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
prices and so forth this is what we
think<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:34.079> close<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.619> USDA<00:01:34.950> said

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
think so very close to what USDA said

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
think so very close to what USDA said
but<00:01:35.759> certainly<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.360> 90<00:01:36.720> million<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.140> 91<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.590> 92

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
but certainly not 90 million or 91 or 92

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.210 
but certainly not 90 million or 91 or 92
million<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.790> something<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:40.220> personally

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
million like some something I personally

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.450 
million like some something I personally
we're<00:01:41.640> finishing<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.180> our<00:01:42.360> our<00:01:42.780> our<00:01:43.310> survey<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
we're finishing up our our our survey of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
we're finishing up our our our survey of
appliance<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> taken<00:01:45.659> longer<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.079> year

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
appliance and taken longer this year

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
appliance and taken longer this year
because<00:01:46.560> there's<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.890> much<00:01:47.040> uncertainty<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
because there's so much uncertainty in

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
because there's so much uncertainty in
this<00:01:48.509> whole<00:01:48.689> thing<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.890> going

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
this whole thing with what are you going

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.530 
this whole thing with what are you going
to<00:01:50.070> plan<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> wheat<00:01:50.579> acres<00:01:50.909> trying<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> get

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to plan on the wheat acres trying to get

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.300 
to plan on the wheat acres trying to get
an<00:01:51.600> answer<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> can't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
an answer out of that so but I can't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090 
an answer out of that so but I can't
argue<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:54.450> they're<00:01:54.570> saying<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.439> think

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
argue with what they're saying I think

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
argue with what they're saying I think
for<00:01:56.520> us<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.149> seeing<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.659> same<00:01:57.840> thing

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
for us we're also seeing the same thing

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.340 
for us we're also seeing the same thing
where<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.740> we're<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.579> finding<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.350> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
where it's we're just finding that that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.490 
where it's we're just finding that that
acres<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> farmers<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.780> planting

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
acres a lot of farmers are not planting

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.679 
acres a lot of farmers are not planting
more<00:02:05.250> corn<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.119> think<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> thing<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
more corn and I think the thing that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
more corn and I think the thing that
impresses<00:02:07.110> me<00:02:07.409> about<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.069> whole<00:02:08.250> thing<00:02:08.280> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
impresses me about the whole thing is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.820 
impresses me about the whole thing is
the<00:02:08.729> consistency<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the consistency of it and we see a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.550 
the consistency of it and we see a
consistent<00:02:11.540> area<00:02:12.540> where<00:02:12.810> farm

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
consistent area where farm

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
consistent area where farm
are<00:02:13.800> concerned<00:02:14.190> about<00:02:14.400> planning<00:02:15.270> getting<00:02:15.780> at

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
are concerned about planning getting at

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.630 
are concerned about planning getting at
harvested<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> us<00:02:17.069> out<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.280> still

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
harvested as one of us out there still

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.790 
harvested as one of us out there still
have<00:02:17.760> corn<00:02:17.970> harvest<00:02:18.420> let<00:02:19.050> alone<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
have corn harvest let alone get that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.280 
have corn harvest let alone get that
ground<00:02:20.069> ready<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.580> plant<00:02:20.849> again<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.630> think

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
ground ready to plant again so I think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.710 
ground ready to plant again so I think
as<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:23.069> look<00:02:23.099> at<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.520> individually<00:02:24.390> we<00:02:24.420> say

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
as we look at this individually we say

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.300 
as we look at this individually we say
to<00:02:24.780> ourselves<00:02:24.959> when<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.650> got<00:02:25.830> done<00:02:26.010> planting

ready for corn and salt and we know last

fall<00:02:41.700> out<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> acres<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.599> didn't<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.349> planted

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
fall out of acres I didn't get planted

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.550 
fall out of acres I didn't get planted
wheat<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.220> maybe<00:02:45.209> they<00:02:45.450> planted<00:02:45.840> 25<00:02:46.350> beans

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
wheat so maybe they planted 25 beans

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.250 
wheat so maybe they planted 25 beans
again<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:48.120> corn<00:02:48.360> acres<00:02:48.630> are<00:02:48.810> implanted

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
again and the corn acres are implanted

again and the corn acres are implanted
corn<00:02:49.500> andando<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.459> those<00:02:50.760> soybean<00:02:51.330> acres<00:02:51.630> but

corn andando on those soybean acres but

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.840 
corn andando on those soybean acres but
nevertheless<00:02:52.049> pretty<00:02:53.040> much<00:02:53.220> ready<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.549> plant

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
nevertheless pretty much ready to plant

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.630 
nevertheless pretty much ready to plant
corn<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.360> it's<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> difference<00:02:54.930> between<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640

million acres of well we would deal as

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.520 
million acres of well we would deal as

corn on weeding Kurds are corn and

corn on weeding Kurds are corn and

neighborhood you've got it you've got to

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.630 
neighborhood you've got it you've got to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
ask yourself how much of that corn

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.850 
ask yourself how much of that corn
didn't<00:03:15.120> get<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.299> getting<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.989> till<00:03:16.230> last<00:03:16.560> year

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
didn't get it getting it till last year

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.550 
didn't get it getting it till last year
and<00:03:17.220> what's<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.790> likelihood<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.870> not

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
and what's the likelihood of that not

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.990 
and what's the likelihood of that not
going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.070> corn<00:03:20.310> again<00:03:20.459> because<00:03:20.850> they

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
going to corn again because they

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.580 
going to corn again because they
couldn't<00:03:21.209> get<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.170> we're<00:03:22.320> seeing

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
couldn't get it in and that we're seeing

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.229 
couldn't get it in and that we're seeing
that<00:03:22.799> farmers<00:03:23.519> are<00:03:23.640> believing<00:03:24.060> themselves
