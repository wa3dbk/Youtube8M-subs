00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.099 
kitchen making some fun goodies which i
am<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> make<00:00:30.109> pistachio

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
am actually going to make pistachio

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.799 
am actually going to make pistachio
bread<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:33.000> only<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.809> i'm<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> use

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
bread but not only and i'm going to use

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.610 
bread but not only and i'm going to use
raw<00:00:37.399> perception<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:39.120> decided<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> get

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
raw perception i actually decided to get

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520 
raw perception i actually decided to get
them<00:00:41.040> RT<00:00:41.910> shelling<00:00:42.360> their<00:00:42.600> raw<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.230> their

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
them RT shelling their raw and their

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
them RT shelling their raw and their
unsalted<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.460> i<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.789> regulate<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.300> salt<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
unsalted so i can regulate the salt a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.400 
unsalted so i can regulate the salt a
little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.890> i'm<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.309> i<00:00:48.200> created<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
little bit but i'm also i created a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.549 
little bit but i'm also i created a
recipe<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.670> hopefully<00:00:51.030> work<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
recipe that will hopefully work and it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
recipe that will hopefully work and it
involves<00:00:53.250> me<00:00:54.120> dying<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.140> better<00:00:55.879> hopefully

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
involves me dying the better hopefully

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
involves me dying the better hopefully
this<00:00:57.210> works<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.750> always<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.379> theory<00:00:58.590> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this works it's always a good theory but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
this works it's always a good theory but
for<00:00:59.129> st.<00:00:59.550> Patty's<00:00:59.969> Day<00:01:00.020> this<00:01:01.020> Kashia<00:01:01.469> Brad

number<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> good<00:01:02.670> any<00:01:03.270> time<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.350> it's

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
number one is good any time up here it's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
number one is good any time up here it's
delicious<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> nuts<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
delicious because in the nuts are a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.679 
delicious because in the nuts are a
little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.560> less<00:01:07.740> fat<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> are<00:01:08.760> probably<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
little bit less fat and are probably the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.510 
little bit less fat and are probably the
healthiest<00:01:10.260> net<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.710> possibly<00:01:11.250> find

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
healthiest net you can possibly find

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.859

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
worked if it's just green than you know

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.800 
worked if it's just green than you know
it<00:01:24.330> didn't<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> how<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.490> works

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
will be fun because i like to make food

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.889 
will be fun because i like to make food
fun<00:01:42.890> not<00:01:43.890> only<00:01:44.100> because<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:45.000> kind<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.540> cool

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
fun not only because it's kind of cool

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
fun not only because it's kind of cool
to<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.670> actually

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to look at but this one I'm actually

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.010 
to look at but this one I'm actually
going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.369> with<00:01:50.509> salad<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.630> sugar

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
going to make it with salad all sugar

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
going to make it with salad all sugar
salad<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.829> which<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.659> more

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
salad all which is a little bit more

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.240 
salad all which is a little bit more
natural

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.600 

nine<00:01:57.580> percent<00:01:58.000> natural<00:01:58.740> base<00:01:59.740> but<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.370> a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
nine percent natural base but it is a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.960 
nine percent natural base but it is a
processed<00:02:01.300> sugar<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.070> has<00:02:03.340> no<00:02:03.670> calories

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
processed sugar but it has no calories

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.120 
processed sugar but it has no calories
in<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:04.990> just<00:02:05.170> pretty<00:02:05.350> much<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.830> step

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
in it and it's just pretty much one step

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.310 
in it and it's just pretty much one step
away<00:02:06.280> from<00:02:06.400> being<00:02:06.900> natural<00:02:07.900> if<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> want<00:02:08.289> a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
away from being natural if you want a

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.000 
away from being natural if you want a
research<00:02:08.679> boat<00:02:08.890> zone<00:02:09.250> I'll<00:02:09.550> go<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.479> but

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
research boat zone I'll go for it but

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.130 
research boat zone I'll go for it but
it's<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.940> I'm<00:02:13.120> transitioning<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
it's just I like it I'm transitioning to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.370 
it's just I like it I'm transitioning to
