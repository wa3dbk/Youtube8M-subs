00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
on Halloween start out over on this side

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
on Halloween start out over on this side
of<00:00:16.139> your<00:00:16.440> paper<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:19.140> draw<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.680> big<00:00:19.920> curved<00:00:20.609> line

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
of your paper and draw a big curved line

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.210 
of your paper and draw a big curved line
that<00:00:21.510> goes<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.920> then<00:00:25.920> draw

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that goes around like that and then draw

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.620 
that goes around like that and then draw
another<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.779> other<00:00:27.810> side<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.630> they

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
another one on the other side and they

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
another one on the other side and they
connect<00:00:31.109> somewhere<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.219> middle<00:00:33.980> then

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
connect somewhere in the middle then

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
connect somewhere in the middle then
we'll<00:00:35.250> draw<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> eyes<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
we'll draw the eyes on the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
we'll draw the eyes on the
jack-o'-lantern<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:39.090> eyes<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.629> curved<00:00:39.989> just

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
jack-o'-lantern the eyes are curved just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.000 
jack-o'-lantern the eyes are curved just
like<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> side<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> pumpkin<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.420> curved

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
like the side of the pumpkin is curved

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.569 
like the side of the pumpkin is curved
so<00:00:44.010> curved<00:00:44.539> out<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.140> curve<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so curved out and then a curve on the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.720 
so curved out and then a curve on the
inside<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> eye<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.219> then<00:00:53.219> even<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
inside of the eye and then even the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.099 
inside of the eye and then even the
bottom<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.270> has<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> slight<00:00:55.020> curve<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
bottom it has a slight curve to it and

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
bottom it has a slight curve to it and
then<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> eye<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> carve<00:00:59.489> curved

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
then this eye is going to carve curved

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
then this eye is going to carve curved
out<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.840> inside<00:01:04.229> line<00:01:04.530> will

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
out this way and the inside line will

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.600 
out this way and the inside line will
curve<00:01:05.159> slightly<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> bottom<00:01:08.400> line

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
curve slightly and then the bottom line

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.200 
curve slightly and then the bottom line
has<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.299> slight<00:01:09.689> curve<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.930> show<00:01:12.960> how

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
has a slight curve to it to show how

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
has a slight curve to it to show how
thick<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> pumpkin<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.080> we're<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> draw

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
thick the pumpkin is we're going to draw

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.480 
thick the pumpkin is we're going to draw
a<00:01:17.100> line<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.460> down<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.360> side<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:19.490> line

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a line right down the side of this line

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.429 
a line right down the side of this line
just<00:01:21.180> following<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> same<00:01:22.049> curve<00:01:23.119> and

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
just following the same curve and

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
just following the same curve and
another<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.220> side<00:01:28.880> between<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
another one on this side between the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.920 
another one on this side between the
eyes<00:01:30.329> we'll<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.380> make<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> simple<00:01:32.250> triangle

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
eyes we'll just make a simple triangle

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.190 
eyes we'll just make a simple triangle
for<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> nose

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.510 

and<00:01:38.470> then<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.430> mouth<00:01:39.610> starts<00:01:40.210> here<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.369> it

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and then the mouth starts here and it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then the mouth starts here and it
comes<00:01:42.700> across<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:44.710> here<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.720> draw<00:01:46.930> a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
comes across right here and draw a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.990 
comes across right here and draw a
straight<00:01:47.140> line<00:01:47.530> down<00:01:47.830> this<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.700> tooth

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
straight line down this is the tooth

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.260 
straight line down this is the tooth
straight<00:01:49.899> line<00:01:50.110> over<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.430> then<00:01:51.610> this<00:01:51.759> goes<00:01:52.030> up

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
straight line over and then this goes up

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.980 
straight line over and then this goes up
past<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.439> other<00:01:53.560> one<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.860> little<00:01:54.100> bit<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.990> then

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
past the other one a little bit and then

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.960 
past the other one a little bit and then
you<00:01:56.229> continue<00:01:56.440> on<00:01:56.799> with<00:01:57.220> his<00:01:57.430> smile<00:01:59.310> now<00:02:00.310> bring

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
you continue on with his smile now bring

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.789 
you continue on with his smile now bring
this<00:02:01.180> line<00:02:01.479> down<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:04.570> some<00:02:04.869> space<00:02:05.259> below<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
this line down with some space below the

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.229 
this line down with some space below the
tooth<00:02:07.860> follow<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.220> here<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.280> then<00:02:12.580> add

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
tooth follow it to here and then add

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.120 
tooth follow it to here and then add
another<00:02:15.330> square<00:02:16.330> shape<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.620> tooth<00:02:17.920> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
another square shape for this tooth and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.620 
another square shape for this tooth and
then<00:02:21.720> connect<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.680> mouth<00:02:27.030> right<00:02:28.030> along<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
then connect the mouth right along the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.229 
then connect the mouth right along the
bottom<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.350> mouth<00:02:29.590> draw<00:02:30.519> a<00:02:30.760> line<00:02:31.000> that

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
bottom of the mouth draw a line that

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.850 
bottom of the mouth draw a line that
follows<00:02:31.500> along<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:34.269> same<00:02:34.569> curve

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.330 

this<00:02:38.860> shows<00:02:39.220> how<00:02:39.580> thick<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.690> pumpkin<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:44.340> up

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
this shows how thick the pumpkin is up

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.530 
this shows how thick the pumpkin is up
here<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> stem

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
here for the stem

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.240 
here for the stem
we'll<00:02:47.290> make<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.950> line<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.400> curves<00:02:48.609> up<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
we'll make a line that curves up and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.759 
we'll make a line that curves up and
then<00:02:51.250> we're<00:02:51.519> gonna<00:02:51.670> make<00:02:51.970> an<00:02:52.120> oval<00:02:52.660> shape<00:02:53.019> on

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
then we're gonna make an oval shape on

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.410 
then we're gonna make an oval shape on
top<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:56.590> line<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.130> curves<00:02:57.340> back<00:02:57.790> down<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
top and a line that curves back down and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.259 
top and a line that curves back down and
that's<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.750> stem<00:02:59.489> with<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.519> couple<00:03:01.000> little

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
that's the stem with a couple little

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:08.640 
that's the stem with a couple little
curly<00:03:01.859> twig<00:03:02.859> sticking<00:03:03.100> out<00:03:07.109> next<00:03:08.109> we're<00:03:08.530> going

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
curly twig sticking out next we're going

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.050 
curly twig sticking out next we're going
to<00:03:08.739> add<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.670> creases<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.600> pumpkin<00:03:12.060> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
to add the creases on the pumpkin and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.000 
to add the creases on the pumpkin and
they<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.170> follow<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.769> same<00:03:15.040> curve<00:03:15.670> as<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
they just follow the same curve as the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.199 
they just follow the same curve as the
outside<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.760> pumpkin<00:03:19.180> there's<00:03:19.630> one<00:03:19.840> there

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
outside of the pumpkin there's one there

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.690 
outside of the pumpkin there's one there
when<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.510> comes<00:03:22.540> down<00:03:23.290> here<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.519> to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
when it comes down here and you have to

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.340 
when it comes down here and you have to
imagine<00:03:24.970> where<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.600> going<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.870> come<00:03:25.930> out<00:03:26.200> on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
imagine where it's going to come out on

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.150 
imagine where it's going to come out on

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
the other side it's not always perfect

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.630 
the other side it's not always perfect
and<00:03:31.470> then<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.799> side<00:03:33.100> curves<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.670> other<00:03:33.880> way

it's the horizon where the sky meets the
ground<00:07:25.070> so<00:07:25.910> draw<00:07:26.630> a<00:07:26.660> straight<00:07:26.990> line<00:07:27.020> behind

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
ground so draw a straight line behind

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.790 
ground so draw a straight line behind
the<00:07:27.980> kitty<00:07:28.510> behind<00:07:29.510> the<00:07:29.660> pumpkin<00:07:30.110> imagine

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
the kitty behind the pumpkin imagine

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.230 
the kitty behind the pumpkin imagine
where<00:07:31.070> it<00:07:31.280> would<00:07:31.400> come<00:07:31.430> out<00:07:31.610> on<00:07:32.000> the<00:07:32.210> other

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
where it would come out on the other

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.030 
where it would come out on the other
side<00:07:32.690> and<00:07:33.440> draw<00:07:33.650> a<00:07:33.680> line<00:07:34.690> and<00:07:35.690> the<00:07:36.500> last<00:07:36.740> thing

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
side and draw a line and the last thing

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.000 
side and draw a line and the last thing
is<00:07:37.280> there's<00:07:37.850> a<00:07:37.910> huge<00:07:38.180> moon<00:07:38.780> full<00:07:39.440> moon<00:07:39.650> in<00:07:39.920> the

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
is there's a huge moon full moon in the

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.490 
is there's a huge moon full moon in the
background<00:07:40.690> so<00:07:41.690> you<00:07:41.720> have<00:07:41.990> to<00:07:42.170> use<00:07:42.320> your

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500 
background so you have to use your

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.360 
background so you have to use your
imagination<00:07:42.560> on<00:07:43.250> this<00:07:43.430> one<00:07:43.900> just<00:07:44.900> a<00:07:45.050> big

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370 
imagination on this one just a big

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.170 
imagination on this one just a big
circle<00:07:46.370> and<00:07:47.110> imagine<00:07:48.430> where<00:07:49.430> it<00:07:49.790> would<00:07:49.970> come

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:50.180 
circle and imagine where it would come

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:57.630 
circle and imagine where it would come
across<00:07:51.610> and<00:07:52.610> down<00:07:54.580> and<00:07:55.580> so<00:07:55.850> there<00:07:56.120> you<00:07:56.240> have<00:07:56.390> it

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640 
across and down and so there you have it

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.050 
across and down and so there you have it
and<00:07:58.640> here's<00:07:59.120> what<00:07:59.300> it<00:07:59.420> looks<00:07:59.600> like<00:07:59.780> colored

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060 
and here's what it looks like colored

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.570 
and here's what it looks like colored
I've<00:08:02.060> drawn<00:08:02.390> this<00:08:02.570> picture<00:08:02.630> with<00:08:03.580> second

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.580 
I've drawn this picture with second

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.190 
I've drawn this picture with second
