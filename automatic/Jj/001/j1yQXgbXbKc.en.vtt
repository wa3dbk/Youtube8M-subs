00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.910 

brackets<00:02:16.680> themselves<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.560> basically

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
brackets themselves so you basically

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
brackets themselves so you basically
need<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.130> buy<00:02:20.310> two<00:02:20.370> things<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.600> combine<00:02:21.990> they

were<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.530> 120<00:02:23.160> dollars<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:24.690> post<00:02:25.110> mounting

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
were about 120 dollars the post mounting

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.900 
were about 120 dollars the post mounting
set<00:02:26.160> was<00:02:26.340> about<00:02:26.550> $85<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.160> good<00:02:29.310> $50

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
set was about $85 so it's a good $50

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.330 
set was about $85 so it's a good $50
less<00:02:30.120> than<00:02:30.150> goats<00:02:30.570> brackets<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.130> get

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
less than goats brackets and you can get

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.790 
less than goats brackets and you can get
it<00:02:32.460> set<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.700> pretty<00:02:33.030> darn<00:02:33.270> close<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.960> measured

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it set up pretty darn close I measured

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.490 
it set up pretty darn close I measured
this<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.730> distance<00:02:36.090> from<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.570> grommet<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
this the distance from this grommet to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.520 
this the distance from this grommet to
the<00:02:37.740> actual<00:02:38.330> interior<00:02:39.330> side<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.959> rear

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the actual interior side of the rear

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.740 
the actual interior side of the rear
brace<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.580> exactly<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.450> 1/16<00:02:43.050> inch<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
brace it's exactly one in 1/16 inch and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.320 
brace it's exactly one in 1/16 inch and
that's<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:45.930> darn<00:02:46.170> close<00:02:46.410> compared<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:48.060> the

that's pretty darn close compared to the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's pretty darn close compared to the
only<00:02:48.510> thing<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:48.870> would<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.709> would<00:02:49.860> fit

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
only thing I think would that would fit

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.510 
only thing I think would that would fit
better<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.989> custom<00:02:51.989> fabricated<00:02:52.500> setup<00:02:52.950> so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
better is a custom fabricated setup so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.750 
better is a custom fabricated setup so
anyways<00:02:53.880> onto<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.510> bags<00:02:54.800> very<00:02:55.800> very<00:02:56.520> good

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
anyways onto the bags very very good

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.760 
anyways onto the bags very very good
build<00:02:56.970> quality<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:58.170> exception<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
build quality with the exception of the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.470 
build quality with the exception of the
fact<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.220> got<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> unfinished<00:03:00.180> version

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
fact that I got the unfinished version

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.180 
fact that I got the unfinished version
so<00:03:01.020> they<00:03:01.200> tend<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> take<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> little<00:03:01.980> bit<00:03:02.070> of

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
so they tend to take a little bit of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.290 
so they tend to take a little bit of
Liberty<00:03:02.610> with<00:03:02.880> how<00:03:03.570> they<00:03:05.060> don't<00:03:06.060> finish

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
Liberty with how they don't finish

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.410 
Liberty with how they don't finish
things<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.140> seen<00:03:08.000> right<00:03:09.000> I'll<00:03:09.150> have<00:03:09.270> to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
things like that seen right I'll have to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.850 
things like that seen right I'll have to
rough<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.200> sand<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.739> get<00:03:10.830> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
rough this in and sand it out and get it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.050 
rough this in and sand it out and get it
all<00:03:10.980> nice<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.130> smooth<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.610> get<00:03:11.760> ready<00:03:11.880> for

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
all nice and smooth and get ready for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060 
all nice and smooth and get ready for
paint<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:13.020> say<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:13.350> paint<00:03:13.590> ready<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:13.950> it's

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
paint they say it's paint ready but it's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.510 
paint they say it's paint ready but it's
really<00:03:14.220> not<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.489> wouldn't<00:03:14.880> paint<00:03:15.060> that

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
really not I wouldn't paint that

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.699 
really not I wouldn't paint that
obviously<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.760> gaskets<00:03:18.239> are<00:03:19.050> not<00:03:19.290> fitted

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
obviously the gaskets are not fitted

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.190 
obviously the gaskets are not fitted
because<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.610> need<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.820> paint<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.989> cut

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
because you need to paint it so I cut

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.010 
because you need to paint it so I cut
these<00:03:22.320> two<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.940> know<00:03:24.060> close<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> length

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
these two you know close to the length

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.900 
these two you know close to the length
of<00:03:25.470> where<00:03:25.770> they<00:03:25.860> need<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.100> be<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.790> then

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
of where they need to be and then

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.070 
of where they need to be and then
there's<00:03:27.090> wrinkles<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.570> I'm<00:03:27.630> but<00:03:27.810> when<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
there's wrinkles and I'm but when you

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.510 
there's wrinkles and I'm but when you
when<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.560> mount<00:03:28.739> these<00:03:28.920> you'll<00:03:29.160> put<00:03:29.340> glue

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
when you mount these you'll put glue

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.740 
when you mount these you'll put glue
inside<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.970> them<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.239> they'll<00:03:30.330> all<00:03:30.480> glue

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
inside of them and they'll all glue

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.930 
inside of them and they'll all glue
flush<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.320> be<00:03:32.100> nice<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.550> neat<00:03:32.610> after<00:03:32.880> you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
flush and be nice and neat after you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.610 
flush and be nice and neat after you
tape<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.239> up<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.540> then<00:03:33.630> let<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.870> dry<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.380> take

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
tape it up and then let it dry and take

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.490 
tape it up and then let it dry and take
the<00:03:34.709> tape<00:03:34.890> off<00:03:35.360> interior<00:03:36.360> is<00:03:36.540> pre<00:03:37.020> carpeted

the tape off interior is pre carpeted
very<00:03:37.830> nice<00:03:38.480> carpeting

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
very nice carpeting

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.069 
very nice carpeting
they<00:03:40.920> are<00:03:41.070> fiberglass<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:41.940> there's<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.780> bit<00:03:42.989> of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
they are fiberglass so there's a bit of

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.110 
they are fiberglass so there's a bit of
a<00:03:43.170> fiberglass<00:03:43.709> smell<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.730> not<00:03:44.880> overbearing

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
a fiberglass smell it's not overbearing

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.540 
a fiberglass smell it's not overbearing
though

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
though

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.880 
though
and<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:48.580> have<00:03:49.580> these<00:03:49.730> two<00:03:49.790> holes<00:03:50.240> here<00:03:50.890> because

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
and I have these two holes here because

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.560 
and I have these two holes here because
their<00:03:54.070> hinges<00:03:55.070> don't<00:03:55.550> have<00:03:55.730> any<00:03:55.910> limitation

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
their hinges don't have any limitation

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.840 
their hinges don't have any limitation
on<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.990> rotation<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.130> what<00:03:58.280> they<00:03:58.400> did<00:03:58.460> is<00:03:58.670> it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
on the rotation so what they did is it

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.330 
on the rotation so what they did is it
had<00:03:58.970> an<00:03:59.060> internal<00:03:59.390> limiting<00:03:59.840> strap<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:01.160> was

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
had an internal limiting strap that was

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.160 
had an internal limiting strap that was
riveted<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.060> lid<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.570> then<00:04:02.690> riveted<00:04:03.080> to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
riveted to the lid and then riveted to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.080 
riveted to the lid and then riveted to
the<00:04:03.260> body<00:04:03.500> my<00:04:04.220> lower<00:04:06.640> quick-detach<00:04:07.640> mounting

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the body my lower quick-detach mounting

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.470 
the body my lower quick-detach mounting
point<00:04:09.070> actually<00:04:10.070> engulfed<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.120> hole<00:04:11.300> that

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
point actually engulfed the hole that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.880 
point actually engulfed the hole that
was<00:04:11.570> left<00:04:11.630> on<00:04:11.930> this<00:04:12.050> side<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.530> still<00:04:12.770> have

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
was left on this side so I still have

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.020 
was left on this side so I still have
the<00:04:12.920> hole<00:04:13.130> in<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.280> lid<00:04:13.430> that'll<00:04:13.700> need<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:13.940> be

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
the hole in the lid that'll need to be

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.660 
the hole in the lid that'll need to be
patched<00:04:14.240> when<00:04:14.570> I<00:04:14.600> do<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.410> bodywork<00:04:15.710> but<00:04:16.459> if<00:04:16.580> I

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
patched when I do the bodywork but if I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.740 
patched when I do the bodywork but if I
lift<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.000> up<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.720> come<00:04:18.680> back<00:04:18.709> you<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:20.600> see

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
lift this up and come back you can see

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.570 
lift this up and come back you can see
this<00:04:20.870> need<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.470> rotate<00:04:21.680> if<00:04:22.010> my<00:04:22.160> handle<00:04:22.400> bars

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
this need to rotate if my handle bars

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.310 
this need to rotate if my handle bars
weren't<00:04:22.760> right<00:04:22.970> where<00:04:23.120> they're<00:04:23.240> at<00:04:23.270> but<00:04:24.230> it

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
weren't right where they're at but it

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.870 
weren't right where they're at but it
would<00:04:24.410> continue<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.770> rotate<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.370> put<00:04:25.520> stress

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
would continue to rotate and put stress

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.460 
would continue to rotate and put stress
on<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.210> joint<00:04:26.510> which<00:04:26.720> is<00:04:26.870> why<00:04:27.050> they<00:04:27.230> put<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
on this joint which is why they put the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.440 
on this joint which is why they put the
limiting<00:04:27.770> straps<00:04:28.040> on<00:04:28.220> what<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.090> plan<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.360> doing

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
limiting straps on what I plan on doing

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.320 
limiting straps on what I plan on doing
is<00:04:30.070> very<00:04:31.070> straightforward<00:04:31.430> I'm<00:04:32.000> putting<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
is very straightforward I'm putting the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.810 
is very straightforward I'm putting the
aluminum<00:04:32.570> straps<00:04:32.810> on<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> inside<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.550> a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
aluminum straps on the inside so that a

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.470 
aluminum straps on the inside so that a
length<00:04:35.480> of<00:04:35.600> material<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:37.100> will<00:04:37.280> bulge<00:04:37.520> will

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
length of material that will bulge will

point here would be a leather strap and
it<00:04:45.110> will<00:04:45.200> come<00:04:45.380> in<00:04:45.530> mount<00:04:45.770> here<00:04:46.160> as<00:04:46.310> well<00:04:46.580> so

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
it will come in mount here as well so

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.630 
it will come in mount here as well so
that<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.110> lid<00:04:48.440> will<00:04:48.650> not<00:04:48.830> open<00:04:48.980> any<00:04:49.280> longer

that the lid will not open any longer

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.210 
that the lid will not open any longer
than<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.120> length<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.860> strap<00:04:51.860> will<00:04:52.010> allow

than the length of the strap will allow

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.620 
than the length of the strap will allow
and<00:04:52.430> it'll<00:04:52.610> just<00:04:52.790> put<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> little<00:04:53.270> bit<00:04:53.360> stress

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
and it'll just put a little bit stress

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.350 
and it'll just put a little bit stress
on<00:04:53.780> this<00:04:53.900> lip<00:04:54.400> which<00:04:55.400> one<00:04:55.550> I'm<00:04:55.640> done<00:04:55.820> it's
