00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.350 
us we have an old-style what we call
continental<00:00:10.440> kick<00:00:10.710> wheels<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:11.969> an<00:00:12.210> old

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
continental kick wheels this is an old

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
continental kick wheels this is an old
wheel<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.840> why<00:00:13.230> I've<00:00:13.769> had<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> number<00:00:14.700> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
wheel is why I've had for a number of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.849 
wheel is why I've had for a number of
years<00:00:15.529> unfortunately<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.890> usable

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
years unfortunately it's not usable

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.820 
years unfortunately it's not usable
you<00:00:19.859> sit<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.250> yeah<00:00:21.350> you<00:00:22.350> spin<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> wheel

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you sit on it yeah you spin the wheel

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.960 
you sit on it yeah you spin the wheel
like<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.010> make<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> pot<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.939> this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
like this so you make the pot like this

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.109 
like this so you make the pot like this
sort<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> slightly<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.560> side<00:00:29.119> it's

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
sort of slightly to one side it's

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.330 
sort of slightly to one side it's
actually<00:00:30.420> quite<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> good<00:00:30.750> throwing<00:00:31.260> position

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.260 

unfortunately<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:36.210> wheel<00:00:37.610> has<00:00:38.610> come<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
unfortunately this wheel has come to the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.470 
unfortunately this wheel has come to the
end<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.660> its<00:00:39.809> useful<00:00:40.290> life<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> propose

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
end of its useful life so what I propose

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.430 
end of its useful life so what I propose
to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.180> working<00:00:45.480> parts<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
to do is to take the working parts the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.520 
to do is to take the working parts the
mechanism<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.250> other<00:00:47.399> words<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.530> lower

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
mechanism in other words the the lower

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.569 
mechanism in other words the the lower
wheel<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> axle<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> two

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
wheel here and the axle and the two

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
wheel here and the axle and the two
bearings<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.160> wheel<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
bearings and the top wheel there the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.520 
bearings and the top wheel there the
wheel<00:00:58.440> head<00:00:58.710> and<00:01:02.210> make<00:01:03.210> another<00:01:03.600> either<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
wheel head and make another either of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
wheel head and make another either of
metal<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.129> wood<00:01:05.840> now<00:01:06.840> I've<00:01:06.960> taken<00:01:07.140> photographs

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
metal or wood now I've taken photographs

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
metal or wood now I've taken photographs
of<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> wheel<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:09.000> angles<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.780> I've

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of this wheel from all angles and I've

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.969 
of this wheel from all angles and I've
measured<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.580> but<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:13.170> make

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
measured it but now it's time to make

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.530 
measured it but now it's time to make
firewood<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.360> let's<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
firewood out of it so let's go it's a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:37.230 
firewood out of it so let's go it's a
sad<00:01:18.780> day<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:20.090> spot

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
full of wood one you see this is what I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:55.190 
full of wood one you see this is what I
want<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:38.450> bearing<00:02:38.930> there

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200

there<00:02:56.200> are<00:02:56.440> folks<00:02:57.870> firewood<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:01.360> hopefully

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
there are folks firewood and hopefully

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:14.520 
there are folks firewood and hopefully
the<00:03:02.290> beginnings<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:04.300> new<00:03:04.330> wheel<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:14.290> you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the beginnings of a new wheel and you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.090 
the beginnings of a new wheel and you
like<00:03:14.770> for<00:03:15.070> this<00:03:15.130> wheel<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.300> next<00:03:19.570> clip

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
like for this wheel see in the next clip

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.630 
like for this wheel see in the next clip
keep<00:03:21.100> practicing

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.640
