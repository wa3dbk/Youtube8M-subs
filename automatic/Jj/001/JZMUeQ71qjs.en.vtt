00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
points and condenser and a mag it fires

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.089 
points and condenser and a mag it fires
right<00:02:36.650> up<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:38.329> just<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.810> mean<00:02:39.260> two<00:02:39.650> turns<00:02:39.890> at<00:02:40.069> a

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
right up you just I mean two turns at a

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.340 
right up you just I mean two turns at a
crank<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.549> she's<00:02:40.700> running<00:02:41.090> don't<00:02:42.079> mean<00:02:42.230> just

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
crank and she's running don't mean just

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.380 
crank and she's running don't mean just
bump<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> start<00:02:42.950> or<00:02:43.100> two<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:44.000> she<00:02:44.150> fires

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
bump the start or two and she fires

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.660 
bump the start or two and she fires
right<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:44.680> good<00:02:45.680> compression<00:02:46.280> all<00:02:46.430> four

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
right up good compression all four

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.390 
right up good compression all four
cylinders<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> said<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.500> pulled<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
cylinders like I said I pulled the the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.210 
cylinders like I said I pulled the the
manifold<00:02:50.180> off<00:02:50.359> just<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.350> change<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.739> gasket

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
manifold off just to change the gasket

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.620 
manifold off just to change the gasket
and<00:02:52.340> check<00:02:52.549> everything<00:02:52.700> out<00:02:53.090> just<00:02:53.389> to<00:02:53.480> make

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
and check everything out just to make

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.390 
and check everything out just to make
sure<00:02:53.660> it's<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.260> didn't<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.739> vacuum<00:02:55.100> leak<00:02:55.130> or

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
sure it's I didn't have a vacuum leak or

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.500 
sure it's I didn't have a vacuum leak or
something<00:02:55.810> but<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.290> don't<00:02:58.010> know<00:02:58.329> kind<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.359> my

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
something but I don't know kind of my

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.559 
something but I don't know kind of my
wit's<00:02:59.690> end<00:02:59.810> with<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.109> one<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:01.569> hopefully

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
wit's end with this one but hopefully

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:03.759 
wit's end with this one but hopefully
we'll<00:03:02.750> be<00:03:02.870> able<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.049> get<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.319> running<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
we'll be able to get it running and

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.590 
we'll be able to get it running and
it'll<00:03:04.609> be<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> good<00:03:04.880> little<00:03:04.970> used<00:03:05.209> tractor

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
it'll be a good little used tractor

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.849 
it'll be a good little used tractor
because<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:05.900> got<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> set<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.350> choppers<00:03:06.709> in

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
because it's got a set of choppers in

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.400 
because it's got a set of choppers in
the<00:03:06.889> back<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.310> already<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:08.410> somebody's

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
the back of it already and somebody's

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.990 
the back of it already and somebody's
converted<00:03:09.859> this<00:03:09.950> thing<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.250> hire<00:03:10.430> crop<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.819> mean

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
converted this thing to hire crop I mean

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.670 
converted this thing to hire crop I mean
you<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.480> huge<00:03:11.780> thar<00:03:12.109> somebody<00:03:12.530> put

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
you can see the huge thar somebody put

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.479 
you can see the huge thar somebody put
on<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.829> back<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.160> thing<00:03:13.220> with

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
on the back of this thing with

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.979 
on the back of this thing with
extensions<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.359> the<00:03:14.450> original<00:03:14.720> hubs

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
extensions going to the original hubs

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.099 
extensions going to the original hubs
and<00:03:15.350> then<00:03:15.980> they<00:03:16.220> welded<00:03:16.519> up<00:03:16.609> this<00:03:16.810> high<00:03:17.810> crop

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
and then they welded up this high crop

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.410 
and then they welded up this high crop

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
it's not like I said hopefully I can get

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.490 
it's not like I said hopefully I can get
this<00:03:24.220> thing<00:03:24.430> fired<00:03:24.610> up<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.000> running<00:03:25.270> and

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
never did look at the serial number see

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.860 
never did look at the serial number see
what<00:03:42.580> year<00:03:42.700> described<00:03:43.030> as<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.420> matter<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.810> fact

what year described as a matter of fact

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.180 
what year described as a matter of fact
that<00:03:44.080> we<00:03:44.260> could<00:03:44.350> find<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.680> serial<00:03:44.860> number<00:03:44.980> on

that we could find the serial number on
it<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:46.410> did<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.770> popping<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.489> sputtering

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
it I did have it popping and sputtering

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.570 
it I did have it popping and sputtering
years<00:03:49.600> ago<00:03:49.959> when<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:50.890> first<00:03:50.950> started<00:03:51.250> working

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
years ago when I first started working

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.910 
years ago when I first started working
out<00:03:51.849> here<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.750> now<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.959> engines<00:03:53.470> locked<00:03:53.709> up

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
out here but now the engines locked up

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.070 
out here but now the engines locked up
for<00:03:54.190> me<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.489> don't<00:03:55.300> know<00:03:55.360> how<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.510> came<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.050> be

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
for me I don't know how that came to be

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.500 
for me I don't know how that came to be
but<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.769> went<00:03:57.489> ahead<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:57.670> pull<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.850> plug<00:03:58.150> shots

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
but I went ahead and pull the plug shots

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.620 
but I went ahead and pull the plug shots
and<00:03:58.660> crawl<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.140> cellars<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.540> that'll<00:04:01.540> be

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
and crawl in the cellars and that'll be

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.449 
and crawl in the cellars and that'll be
one<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.870> my<00:04:01.959> next<00:04:02.440> projects<00:04:02.890> especially<00:04:03.130> not

as the engines running ready it holds up
maybe<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.700> shut<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:43.970> engine<00:05:44.210> off<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.390> right

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
years so it really won't hold water

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.050
