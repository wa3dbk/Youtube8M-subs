what this is here it's something on the
piled<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.920> here<00:00:11.130> but<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.790> can<00:00:11.880> see<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.240> is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
piled up here but as you can see this is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.580 
piled up here but as you can see this is
intercity<00:00:12.750> ministry<00:00:13.170> property<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.519> sense<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
intercity ministry property that sense I

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.880 
intercity ministry property that sense I
don't<00:00:16.590> know<00:00:16.650> ten<00:00:16.920> feet<00:00:17.160> maybe<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:19.740> 10

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
don't know ten feet maybe I think 10

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.730 
don't know ten feet maybe I think 10
feet<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.310> be<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:22.189> pretty<00:00:23.189> close<00:00:23.460> estimate

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
feet would be a pretty close estimate

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
feet would be a pretty close estimate
bottle<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.800> propane<00:00:26.160> from<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> chaos

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
bottle of propane from one of the chaos

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.900 
bottle of propane from one of the chaos
I<00:00:27.449> imagine<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.080> lot<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.859> diesel<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> water

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I imagine a lot of diesel in the water

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.229 
I imagine a lot of diesel in the water
it's<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.320> stinky<00:00:32.059> looks<00:00:33.059> like

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it's really really stinky looks like

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
it's really really stinky looks like
that<00:00:33.420> fuel<00:00:33.950> container<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.370> tipped

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that fuel container over there's tipped

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.600 
that fuel container over there's tipped
over<00:00:36.380> Cowboys<00:00:37.380> camp<00:00:37.739> completely<00:00:38.399> gone<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
over Cowboys camp completely gone I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209 
over Cowboys camp completely gone I
don't<00:00:39.059> see<00:00:39.210> his<00:00:39.420> structure<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.980> are

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
don't see his structure at all there are

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
don't see his structure at all there are
what<00:00:41.550> appears<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.000> floating<00:00:42.510> tents<00:00:42.870> back

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
what appears to be floating tents back

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.130 
what appears to be floating tents back
there<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> water<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
there you can see that the water if you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.549 
there you can see that the water if you
look<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.800> right<00:00:47.430> directly<00:00:47.879> straight<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.559> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
look back right directly straight back a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.209 
look back right directly straight back a
lot<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.489> water<00:00:51.110> underneath<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.410> bridge<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
lot of water underneath the bridge and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.939 
lot of water underneath the bridge and
in<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.460> big<00:00:53.670> field<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.809> field<00:00:55.140> sits<00:00:55.649> lower

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
in that big field that field sits lower

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.270 
in that big field that field sits lower
than<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> rest<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.989> imagine<00:00:58.920> that's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
than the rest so I imagine that's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.910 
than the rest so I imagine that's
probably<00:00:59.579> 15<00:01:00.000> 20<00:01:00.180> foot<00:01:00.539> deep<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> then

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
probably 15 20 foot deep there and then

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
probably 15 20 foot deep there and then
looking<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> where

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
looking back all the way back to where

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
looking back all the way back to where
you<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> white<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> big

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you see the white the kind of the big

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.390 
you see the white the kind of the big
light<00:01:06.240> structure<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.159> big

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
light structure to the right of the big

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
light structure to the right of the big
sort<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> pan<00:01:09.540> building<00:01:11.210> that's<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.720> where

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
sort of pan building that's back where

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870

done it's gone so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.510 
done it's gone so
the<00:01:23.820> campus<00:01:24.320> history<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.380> again<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.040> walkway

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the campus history and again the walkway

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.030 
the campus history and again the walkway
that<00:01:32.790> comes<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> tent<00:01:33.570> city<00:01:34.369> completely

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
that comes out of tent city completely

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
that comes out of tent city completely
underwater<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> Vans<00:01:46.880> windows<00:01:47.880> deep<00:01:48.350> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
underwater the Vans windows deep and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.530 
underwater the Vans windows deep and
water<00:01:49.770> school<00:01:50.610> bus<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> its<00:01:51.420> headlights

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
water school bus up to its headlights

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.620 
water school bus up to its headlights
the<00:01:54.540> church<00:01:54.780> bus<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.619> higher<00:01:55.800> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the church bus it's a little higher and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.359 
the church bus it's a little higher and
probably<00:01:57.630> still<00:01:58.050> another<00:01:58.380> few<00:01:58.770> feet<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:59.039> go

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
probably still another few feet to go

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.040 
probably still another few feet to go
before<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.910> really<00:02:00.060> crests<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.630> starts<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
before it really crests and starts to

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:10.160 
before it really crests and starts to
drop<00:02:01.289> so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.990 

so<00:02:11.170> probably<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.890> most<00:02:12.069> fitting<00:02:12.400> vehicle

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so probably the most fitting vehicle

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.860 
so probably the most fitting vehicle
here<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.720> pontoon<00:02:14.260> boat<00:02:14.730> look<00:02:15.730> here<00:02:15.940> all

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
get the city now involved in actually

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.980 
get the city now involved in actually

a<00:04:42.080> real<00:04:42.289> camp<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.039> I<00:04:43.490> think<00:04:43.940> it's<00:04:44.090> going<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.240> be

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
a real camp and I think it's going to be

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.749 
a real camp and I think it's going to be
up<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.570> all<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.810> us<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.320> make<00:04:45.500> sure<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:46.039> we

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
up to all of us to make sure that we

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.170 
up to all of us to make sure that we
don't<00:04:47.680> we<00:04:48.680> don't<00:04:48.860> let<00:04:49.039> this<00:04:49.190> issue<00:04:49.430> die<00:04:49.759> and<00:04:50.060> go

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
don't we don't let this issue die and go

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.240 
don't we don't let this issue die and go
away<00:04:52.120> but<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.150> suspect<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.560> it'll<00:04:54.919> be<00:04:55.009> real

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
away but I suspect that it'll be real

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.960 
away but I suspect that it'll be real
easy<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:56.110> people<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.160> argue<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.490> the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
easy for people to argue that the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.540 
easy for people to argue that the
situation<00:04:59.389> is<00:04:59.900> done<00:05:00.110> now<00:05:00.889> that<00:05:01.130> everybody's

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
situation is done now that everybody's

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.420 
situation is done now that everybody's
gone<00:05:01.759> so<00:05:02.440> it's<00:05:03.440> going<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.710> be<00:05:03.860> extremely

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
gone so it's going to be extremely

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.159 
gone so it's going to be extremely
important<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.479> keep<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:07.419> issue<00:05:08.419> at<00:05:08.960> the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
important to keep the the issue at the

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.469 
important to keep the the issue at the

those<00:06:23.330> buses<00:06:23.900> were<00:06:24.050> at<00:06:24.440> least<00:06:24.710> in<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.280> water

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
those buses were at least in the water

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.360 
those buses were at least in the water
when<00:06:26.630> this<00:06:26.780> flood<00:06:27.530> happened<00:06:28.070> so

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.640 

I<00:06:31.430> guess<00:06:32.240> we're<00:06:32.479> going<00:06:32.960> to<00:06:33.020> have<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.320> wait<00:06:33.470> and

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
I guess we're going to have to wait and

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.310 
I guess we're going to have to wait and
see<00:06:33.740> what<00:06:33.949> the<00:06:33.979> city<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.720> advocates<00:06:35.720> and<00:06:35.990> the

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
see what the city and advocates and the

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.280 
see what the city and advocates and the
faith-based<00:06:36.830> community<00:06:37.040> and<00:06:37.729> all<00:06:38.570> of<00:06:38.780> us<00:06:38.900> can

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
faith-based community and all of us can

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.730 
faith-based community and all of us can
can<00:06:39.889> muster<00:06:40.280> but<00:06:40.729> I<00:06:41.260> don't<00:06:42.260> think<00:06:42.410> this<00:06:42.620> will

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
can muster but I don't think this will

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.820 
can muster but I don't think this will
be<00:06:42.860> the<00:06:42.949> last<00:06:43.100> word<00:06:43.400> on<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.610> camp
