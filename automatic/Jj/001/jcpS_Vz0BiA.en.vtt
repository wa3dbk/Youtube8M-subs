okay<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.269> my<00:00:15.719> carbon<00:00:16.170> arc<00:00:16.350> lamp

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
okay here we have my carbon arc lamp

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.470 
okay here we have my carbon arc lamp
that's<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.370> rough<00:00:17.550> shape<00:00:17.610> that<00:00:18.120> I'm<00:00:18.210> slowly

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
that's in rough shape that I'm slowly

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.720 
that's in rough shape that I'm slowly
restoring<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.320> bits<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> Thompson<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
restoring in bits this is a Thompson and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.060 
restoring in bits this is a Thompson and
these<00:00:23.730> lamps<00:00:24.179> were<00:00:24.359> used<00:00:24.420> before

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
these lamps were used before

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.620 
these lamps were used before
incandescent<00:00:26.070> lighting<00:00:26.490> came<00:00:26.849> around<00:00:27.179> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
incandescent lighting came around so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
incandescent lighting came around so
they<00:00:27.779> were<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.410> electric

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
they were one of the first electric

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.579 
they were one of the first electric
light<00:00:29.160> sources<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
light sources and all they are this is a

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.940 
light sources and all they are this is a
really<00:00:32.310> big<00:00:32.550> one<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.500> there<00:00:34.500> were<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.710> two

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
really big one but there were just two

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
really big one but there were just two
two<00:00:35.190> carbon<00:00:35.640> rods<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.210> touch<00:00:36.450> together<00:00:36.720> when

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
two carbon rods that touch together when

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.290 
two carbon rods that touch together when
you<00:00:37.470> put<00:00:37.680> current<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> them<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.490> magnet<00:00:39.180> would

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you put current to them a magnet would

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
you put current to them a magnet would
separate<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:39.990> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.160> form<00:00:41.490> an<00:00:41.640> arc

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
separate them and it would form an arc

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
separate them and it would form an arc
between<00:00:41.880> them<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.690> an<00:00:42.870> arc<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
between them just like an arc in a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
between them just like an arc in a
mercury<00:00:43.620> vapor<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.130> metal<00:00:44.370> halide<00:00:44.520> lamp<00:00:45.000> in

mercury vapor or metal halide lamp in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
mercury vapor or metal halide lamp in
fact<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.080> light<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.440> put<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.830> very

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
fact the light they put out is very

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.460 
fact the light they put out is very
similar<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.450> MH<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.020> mercury<00:00:49.440> vapour

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
similar to an MH or a mercury vapour

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.370 
similar to an MH or a mercury vapour
lamp<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:51.060> a<00:00:51.120> very<00:00:51.330> bright<00:00:51.660> purplish

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
lamp and it's a very bright purplish

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.490 
lamp and it's a very bright purplish
white<00:00:52.650> light<00:00:52.950> and<00:00:53.840> they<00:00:54.840> were<00:00:54.960> used<00:00:55.290> mainly

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
white light and they were used mainly

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
white light and they were used mainly
for<00:00:55.740> street<00:00:56.190> lighting<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.790> industrial

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
for street lighting and industrial

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
for street lighting and industrial
indoor<00:00:58.410> lighting<00:00:58.770> things<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.400> that<00:00:59.640> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
indoor lighting things like that and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.960 
indoor lighting things like that and
they<00:01:00.510> were<00:01:00.570> made<00:01:00.930> even<00:01:01.380> when<00:01:01.710> when<00:01:02.250> electric

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
they were made even when when electric

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.600 
they were made even when when electric
incandescent<00:01:03.660> light<00:01:04.080> came<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:04.979> they

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
incandescent light came around they

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.370 
incandescent light came around they
still<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.330> because<00:01:06.450> incandescent

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
still use them because incandescent

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
still use them because incandescent
bulbs<00:01:07.859> couldn't<00:01:08.159> put<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.399> enough<00:01:08.700> light<00:01:08.969> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
bulbs couldn't put out enough light and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
bulbs couldn't put out enough light and
same<00:01:09.929> thing<00:01:10.200> today<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:11.130> street<00:01:11.490> lighting

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
same thing today we're street lighting

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.240 
same thing today we're street lighting
uses<00:01:12.149> high-pressure<00:01:12.600> sodium<00:01:12.929> which<00:01:13.799> puts<00:01:14.130> out

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
uses high-pressure sodium which puts out

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
uses high-pressure sodium which puts out
a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.700> light<00:01:14.909> than<00:01:15.060> incandescent<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a lot more light than incandescent and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
a lot more light than incandescent and
it's<00:01:16.079> an<00:01:16.200> arc<00:01:16.500> light<00:01:16.859> source<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.939> arc<00:01:18.119> lights

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's an arc light source the arc lights

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
it's an arc light source the arc lights
were<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> high-pressure<00:01:19.200> sodium<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
were the high-pressure sodium of of the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480 
were the high-pressure sodium of of the
late<00:01:20.969> 1800s<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:22.409> produce<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.280> light

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
late 1800s they produce a lot of light

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
late 1800s they produce a lot of light
which<00:01:23.789> an<00:01:23.939> incandescent<00:01:24.270> couldn't<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
which an incandescent couldn't do and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.130 
which an incandescent couldn't do and
they<00:01:26.369> use<00:01:26.549> relatively<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.539> power<00:01:27.719> to<00:01:27.990> do

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
they use relatively little power to do

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.709 
they use relatively little power to do
it<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.729> arc<00:01:29.939> lamp<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.659> King<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.319> until

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
it so the arc lamp was King up until

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.840 
it so the arc lamp was King up until
probably<00:01:33.719> the<00:01:34.079> 20s<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.189> England

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
probably the 20s actually in England

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.489 
probably the 20s actually in England
they<00:01:35.969> use<00:01:36.119> them<00:01:36.359> all<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.719> into<00:01:37.289> the

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
they use them all the way up into the

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:40.370 
they use them all the way up into the
1960s<00:01:38.390> even<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.719> 70s

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
1960s even into the 70s

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.459 
1960s even into the 70s
so<00:01:41.009> arc<00:01:41.819> lamps<00:01:42.359> were<00:01:42.569> with<00:01:42.810> us<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.200> quite<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
so arc lamps were with us for quite a

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.899 
so arc lamps were with us for quite a
while<00:01:43.740> actually<00:01:44.069> even<00:01:44.520> though<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
while actually even though it was the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
while actually even though it was the
first<00:01:45.060> light<00:01:45.539> source<00:01:45.889> these<00:01:46.889> are<00:01:47.069> some<00:01:47.219> of<00:01:47.249> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
first light source these are some of the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789 
first light source these are some of the
internal<00:01:47.759> parts<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.569> frame<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
internal parts this is the frame that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.510 
internal parts this is the frame that
goes<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.310> under<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.340> where

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
goes down under here and this is where

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.590 
goes down under here and this is where
your<00:01:53.700> arc<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.840> goes<00:01:55.049> your<00:01:55.679> carbon<00:01:56.369> rods

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
your arc actually goes your carbon rods

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.660 
your arc actually goes your carbon rods
these<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> windings<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.429> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
these are some of the windings from the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.959 
these are some of the windings from the
coils<00:02:00.060> inside<00:02:00.539> that<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.619> actually<00:02:02.310> shot<00:02:02.579> I'm

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
coils inside that are actually shot I'm

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.760 
coils inside that are actually shot I'm
going<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.359> to<00:02:03.450> redo<00:02:03.780> them<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.709> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
going to have to redo them and this is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.249 
going to have to redo them and this is
this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.639> ballast<00:02:06.119> which<00:02:06.569> piece<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this is the ballast which piece of

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.070 
this is the ballast which piece of
insulation<00:02:07.649> material<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.929> the

insulation material here and this is the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.470 
insulation material here and this is the
ballast<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:11.010> choke<00:02:11.250> coil<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.300> wires

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
ballast or the choke coil and the wires

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.150 
ballast or the choke coil and the wires
are<00:02:12.720> right<00:02:12.870> down<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.200> bare<00:02:13.380> copper<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.040> it's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
are right down to bare copper so it's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.780 
are right down to bare copper so it's
going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.730> rewound

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
going to have to all be rewound

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.399 
going to have to all be rewound
but<00:02:17.099> basically<00:02:18.099> it's<00:02:18.909> on<00:02:19.239> HID<00:02:19.840> light<00:02:20.110> source

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
but basically it's on HID light source

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.679 
but basically it's on HID light source
high<00:02:20.620> intensity<00:02:21.220> discharge<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.909> just<00:02:22.360> it

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
high intensity discharge it's just it

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.110 
high intensity discharge it's just it
does<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.530> arc<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:24.069> air<00:02:24.310> instead<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.819> through

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
does the arc and air instead of through

00:02:25.120 --> 00:03:25.250 
does the arc and air instead of through
a<00:02:25.150> gas<00:02:25.480> or<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> metallic<00:02:26.290> vapor

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:44.850 

I<00:03:25.519> will

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.980 

you

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.050
