has<00:02:16.299> changed<00:02:16.329> but<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.959> feel<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.469> never

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.789 
has changed but I feel like it's never
enough<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.430> always<00:02:18.849> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.269> room<00:02:19.569> for

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
enough it's always going to be room for

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.959 
enough it's always going to be room for
improvement<00:02:20.799> and<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.250> that's<00:02:21.459> what<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
improvement and I think that's what the

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.490 
improvement and I think that's what the
next<00:02:22.269> generation<00:02:22.750> generation<00:02:23.379> generation

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
next generation generation generation

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.770 
next generation generation generation
