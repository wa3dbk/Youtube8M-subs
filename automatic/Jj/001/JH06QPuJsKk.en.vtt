00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
when they play this lick in order of

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.310 
when they play this lick in order of
classic<00:03:43.380> rock<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.920> blues<00:03:44.750> situations<00:03:45.750> they

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
15th fret of the E string it sounds like

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.100 
15th fret of the E string it sounds like
this

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.080 

okay<00:03:57.110> but<00:03:57.770> he<00:03:57.860> uses<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.130> 14th<00:03:58.670> fret<00:03:58.880> which<00:03:59.060> is

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
okay but he uses the 14th fret which is

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.000 
okay but he uses the 14th fret which is
the<00:03:59.360> ninth<00:03:59.569> degree<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.110> scale<00:04:00.230> well<00:04:00.920> the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
the ninth degree of the scale well the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.460 
the ninth degree of the scale well the
second<00:04:01.310> degree<00:04:01.430> or<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.760> ninth<00:04:02.260> which<00:04:03.260> gives

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
second degree or the ninth which gives

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.650 
second degree or the ninth which gives
it<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.620> sort<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:03.950> slightly<00:04:04.430> different<00:04:04.940> twist<00:04:05.450> to

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
it a sort of slightly different twist to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.270 
it a sort of slightly different twist to
it<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.260> I'll<00:04:06.350> play<00:04:06.500> them<00:04:06.650> back-to-back<00:04:06.830> I'll

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
it so I'll play them back-to-back I'll

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.590 
it so I'll play them back-to-back I'll
first<00:04:07.490> play<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.790> conventional<00:04:08.300> way<00:04:08.420> then

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
first play the conventional way then

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.800 
first play the conventional way then
I'll<00:04:08.690> play<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> stevie<00:04:09.410> way<00:04:13.630> national<00:04:14.630> and

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
I'll play the stevie way national and

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.830 
I'll play the stevie way national and
stevie<00:04:15.319> way<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.269> little<00:04:20.359> bit<00:04:20.540> different

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
stevie way it's a little bit different

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.350 
stevie way it's a little bit different
you<00:04:21.019> can<00:04:22.010> very<00:04:22.370> easily<00:04:22.669> switch<00:04:22.940> between<00:04:23.150> the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
you can very easily switch between the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:33.610 
you can very easily switch between the
two<00:04:23.389> mid<00:04:23.750> lick

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.660 

okay<00:04:34.620> that's<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> little<00:04:34.860> overkill<00:04:35.250> perhaps

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
okay that's a little overkill perhaps

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.310 
okay that's a little overkill perhaps
but<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.000> point<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.510> can<00:04:36.660> value<00:04:37.020> things<00:04:37.200> up

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
but the point is you can value things up

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.590 
but the point is you can value things up
and<00:04:37.470> change<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.860> around<00:04:38.270> alright<00:04:39.270> that's<00:04:39.510> the
