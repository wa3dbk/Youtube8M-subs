00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.120
 hello my name is bill ducks sergey 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.050
 Vyacheslavovich 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.490
 I am a software developer 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.620
 futorku 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.379
 which is designed to calculate 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.910
 ration for dairy herds 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.400
 it is made according to 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.860
 the requirements for which we work today 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.380
 in the European Union that is, the calculation 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.529
 conducted that is according to 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.250
 many main quality indicators in 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.779
 the raw material base has more than 316 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 name of raw materials 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.519
 raw materials you can add each raw material has 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.980
 109 quality indicators feed 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.640
 many important indicators perry 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.530
 calculated using the form end 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.530
 factory it is considered automatically 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:55.689
 there is also a weight feeding rate in 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.479
 this is their program 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:07.500
 there are 160 these norms are available only 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.500
 for dairy herds and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.710
 we have the ability to program 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.140
 rations based on the need shoulders 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.159
 the amount of milk that is in litersball 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.229
 You can set it here. 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.740
 the amount she was and want to get 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.319
 and at the same time you will see the result 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:39.390
 which you can from this diet 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:39.390
 you can also get the desired 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:47.369
 the fat you want to get in milk 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.840
 also protein percentage of protein in milk 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.979
 accordingly, turning on all these indicators 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.490
 amounts of liter milk fat protein a 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.759
 also changing the norms of the need you will 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.230
 see how the norms change that is 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.850
 minimum maximum and at the same time 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.160
 in red you will appear 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.920
 What is missing Irina fight excess 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.650
 in the diet that is the main task 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.870
 consists in order that as more it is less 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 red lines that is, it was in the diet 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:30.780
 there is also an opportunity to win 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:35.100
 ration up to 20 items of raw materials from 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.430
 whose diet will be compiled 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.150
 You can choose how to number as possible 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:48.390
 buttons can also be seen here 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.260
 how many 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.940
 the diet will be a mixer that is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.000
 fully mixed diet mystery 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.800
 that is, if you have such here 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.030
 You can specify the number of cows on 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.430
 which will be made generally based on 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.950
 volume mixer for example if you have 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.580
 mixer for 4 tons that is you 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.440
 need to fit on 85 carl before the diet 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.730
 will turn out 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:22.880
 can also make choose from the diet 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.680
 components that will go 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.330
 direct feed and yes 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.030
 respectively 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:39.170
 you will see by quality indicators 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.270
 feed in a round sheet from the diet 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.100
 see the quality indicators of this 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.710
 feed that you have turned in 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.420
 the diet we can do separately 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.140
 directly and then this 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:58.540
 compound feed enter the mixer or separately 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:00.400
 that is, when entering the farm also 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.129
 you can also use the parameter 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.269
 dry matter correction 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.000
 This parameter is important if you 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.010
 have 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.810
 variable humidity well eg silo 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.730
 corn that is you laid it with 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.150
 one humidity in a month he has 2 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.690
 humidity in a month 3 ie the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.030
 when you make a diet that is you 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.280
 change 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.650
 factory and made in the diet after a month you 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.550
 you can in the same diet just 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.650
 introduce a new dry matter ie 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.720
 leave a little relatively immediately 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.139
 change the diet you see what's not 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.639
 enough in the diet of what but men and 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.639
 make a correction accordingly 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.380
 in also in the program in these can 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:57.120
 see the ratio 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:04.690
 calcium phosphorus potassium sodium percentage 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.849
 dry matter dnr and can see times 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.419
 ration cost 1 liter cost 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:15.810
 milk and other indicators 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:20.010
 such as starch is not soluble starch 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.870
 percentage of structural fiber from the root 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:27.250
 percentage of fiber roots 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.710
 Yes, the percentage can also be seen such 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.139
 indicators as the number of liters of milk 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.590
 from which you get from the diet of 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:40.860
 clean energy in tation of raw protein 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:43.349
 but also other key indicators if 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.569
 you will need to see for example 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:52.770
 from where 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:59.569
 Some indicators are taken, that is 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:02.279
 visited or facilitate the introduction of introduction 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:06.419
 feed so and any 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.770
 you can use the following table 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.039
 have to see from where 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:16.770
 sand from what is recruited or otherwise 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:18.839
 figure for example now let's see here 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.819
 starch yes that is starch is recruited 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:23.819
 immediate force qi corn water 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.479
 also recruited corn that is also 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:30.689
 there is a thing of me and wheat is no longer that 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.909
 there is a way we already know for example 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:37.409
 where can we drive 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:40.490
 what feeds to balance this or 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:43.469
 some show the acquisition handle
