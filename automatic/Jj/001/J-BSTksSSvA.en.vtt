the 800-foot mark there's a corner that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300 
the 800-foot mark there's a corner that
goes<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.320> left<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
goes to the left and then back to the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
goes to the left and then back to the
right<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.150> can't<00:01:36.420> make<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.900> corner

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
right if I can't make it to that corner

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.470 
right if I can't make it to that corner
it'd<00:01:37.440> be<00:01:37.560> better<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.100> short<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.730> my

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
it'd be better just to be short with my

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.120 
it'd be better just to be short with my
distance<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.080> world<00:01:40.260> today<00:01:40.470> I'll<00:01:40.890> be

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
distance with the world today I'll be

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.520 
distance with the world today I'll be
able<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.450> corner<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.990> my

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
able to get around the corner so my

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.500 
able to get around the corner so my
choice<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.070> play<00:01:44.280> inside<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.910> tree<00:01:45.150> flat

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
choice is to play inside the tree flat

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.450 
choice is to play inside the tree flat
heiser<00:01:45.900> and<00:01:46.290> let<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.620> go<00:01:46.710> around<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.160> corner

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
heiser and let it go around the corner

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740 
heiser and let it go around the corner
so<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.640> could<00:01:47.790> set<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.300> third<00:01:48.510> shot
