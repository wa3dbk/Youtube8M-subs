00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:40.030
 air temperature in the shade + 15 + 16 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.210
 sunny there was a massive fuck 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:49.480

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.290
 spiritually your first day of heat and here 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.290
 I found today one family of works q 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:10.730
 rather, it is not a dream disqualification although here 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.490
 there is a uterus philologist like this in 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.710
 indoors 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.130
 stretcher space is not more than two 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.909
 centimeters which is not very good 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 affects on 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.630
 not enough to lose and although open 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.300
 you rice from all sides 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.470
 pokemon 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.720
 well humped brood eat and met 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.880
 bigger here 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 underdeveloped cite here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.280
 uterus 1 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.280
 turns winter shaft 2 womb here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:58.950
 same age 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:58.950
 and now look for the old one 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.490
 because me with Marko was tagged 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.900
 here are 2 skeins 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.110
 she won't infect the wings here in her 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.110
 broken mean she went to winter 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.370
 barren and just we crush because 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.370
 she is useless and 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:18.180
 Well, the second means no effect 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:21.180
 give and wintered wreath with water drone here 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.180
 So 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.870
 departure 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.680
 we will now 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.730
 look for 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.730
 second hammer 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.280
 which is not very much but without a label to find 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.170
 womb 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.170
 much harder than tagged 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.690
 debugging our us 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.660
 decided to look 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.270
 what it represents itself is not labeled 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.560
 uterus put one 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.830
 honey and one empty blank frame 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 there is no brood anything look what will happen 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.090
 in a few days if brood breeds 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.120
 her humpback what does all this mean and in general 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:33.090
 no way out means we remove this uterus 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.450
 and we connect this code to the next one 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:41.780
 try to experiment and 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.780
 show what comes out of it 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.560
 when bees wake up 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.160
 then brush my bangs 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.040
 introduced over a puddle and 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.040
 and policy 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.040
 load 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:16.300
 who respects the bees so as not to stick 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:20.669
 that they do not sting 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.669
