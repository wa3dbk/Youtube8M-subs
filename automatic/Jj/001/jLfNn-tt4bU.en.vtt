00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.640
 hi girls new episode to talk to you 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.800
 of the evening with friends and then 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.840
 maybe it's an aperitif 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.940
 dinner or just be at home a 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.640
 have a chat between you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.860
 here are the solutions the first outfit 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.170
 involves the use of a jeans that can be 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.500
 a boyfriend to turn out maybe 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.699
 bottom and to which we match a dress 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.010
 so we call it in fashion jargon or 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.180
 these low ankle boots without heels 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.430
 ground level 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.309
 then match us a blouse is a 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.810
 coat I really like the combination 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.009
 and it's still a fashionable camel trend 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.470
 and bright vivid colors 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.560
 vitamins like orange, coral on 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.660
 fuchsia red and if you want good 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.200
 also with pastel tones and then a big one 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.479
 as in this case a leather doctor 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.340
 and here too many colors all come back 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.840
 how many together then the camel the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.640
 green and the strong tint lit this 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.910
 andrea point look at the second one 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.910
 solution 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.189
 second look with a little grunge taste 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.619
 quietly matched a dress in 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.560
 romantic bonton lace I know we are 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.810
 used to seeing it as too elegant 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.329
 and maybe even in the evening but if so 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.340
 we dramatize with a parka I recommend 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.619
 to buy it this winter tool does not 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.299
 were apparently the network but is from 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.479
 proportions maybe a little wider 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.459
 therefore oversize and all equipped 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.310
 with you remember the shoe I have 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.150
 made to see before that the beatles like 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.130
 these 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 otherwise just to always stay 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.000
 casual but still glam a moccasin from 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 flavor english with a sock also with 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.620
 a conan is fine 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.209
 on the catwalk we noticed the models 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.890
 carry the bags this way 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.230
 arm in arm even if they have one 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.970
 shoulder strap opt for a solution of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 generally you will definitely be glam 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.329
 at this point good talk with 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.329
 your friends, hello girls
