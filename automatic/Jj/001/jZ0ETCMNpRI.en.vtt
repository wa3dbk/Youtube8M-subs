00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.670
 citroen porta francoforte lacatus is a 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.000
 concept that prefigures the lines of the 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.529
 next on the small one also found himself 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.170
 enter this hard-fought one 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.939
 segment but I don't know we'll see 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.430
 let's go see something more though 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.449
 real that can be related can be 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.739
 buy soon version of ds3 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.780
 we have the whole line ds and ds4 le 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.159
 we know we have tried them in 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.519
 just try a 3 field diet in 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:41.389
 these days but new version ds3 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.839
 racing 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:46.940
 what changes the colors you look beautiful 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.719
 matches this matte black with the roof 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.420
 and of course golden rims 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.399
 more powerful motorization seats 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.639
 sports 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.449
 also present in the cabriolet version 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:05.449
 here too a beautiful gray and this 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.770
 I like most are the seats with the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.390
 painted shell of this very fuchsia 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.270
 detail that is also taken up 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.210
 externally in a band under the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 rear-view mirrors but is located 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.770
 not even picasso and here in frankfurt 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.539
 but I had so many dicks 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.380
 we are going around the stand 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:33.740
 here it is the grand picasso with the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.590
 motor € 650 horses that puts only 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.560
 110 grams of co2 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.860
 a car really very much 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.740
 spacious futuristic we look only 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.869
 the dashboard that the display that 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:54.140
 practically a triumph of LCD displays 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.900
 double with even touch infotainment 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.530
 very beautiful screens 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.440
 the headlights front the front that is in 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.420
 also common with the picasso 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.369
 normal so not with the grand picasso 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.450
 what differentiates the two cars the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.540
 back section 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.050
 obviously bigger for the grand 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.990
 picasso with three-dimensional LED headlights 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 which we have seen insert in the range from 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:27.510
 citroen with the ds3 cabrio and here the trunk 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.030
 there really is one of this great picasso 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.730
 the world is huge there are also two 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.990
 seats in this look of sixth and the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.180
 seventh place instead of the rear of the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.180
 c4 normal picasso here it is 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.260
 more if we want more conventional 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.020
 sloping which makes you lose a little 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.020
 city ​​in the trunk 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.340
 maybe electric but I strained it for 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.010
 pull it up 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.510
 you see less load capacity we lose 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.010
 the two back packs the back line 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.510
 decidedly sportier with this 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.510
 not vertical cut but slightly 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 inclined
