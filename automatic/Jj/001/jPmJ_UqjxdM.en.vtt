over here and that's about it
gotta<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.010> window<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.730> working

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
gotta get this window and working

sweet I'm doing some hardcore text box
over<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:55.460> we<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> build<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> game

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
over here we can see a build of the game

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
over here we can see a build of the game

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.679 
where the text does not work correctly
and<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.629> over<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.729> on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> VGA

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689

Antarctica<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:17.079> it<00:01:17.470> doesn't<00:01:17.770> have<00:01:17.920> spaces

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
Antarctica and it doesn't have spaces

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.789 
Antarctica and it doesn't have spaces
because<00:01:19.030> I'm<00:01:19.180> using<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.750> scanf<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.470> I'm<00:01:20.619> too

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
because I'm using a scanf and I'm too

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.940 
because I'm using a scanf and I'm too
lazy<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.280> use<00:01:21.490> spaces<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:23.200> fire<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.710> red

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
lazy to use spaces see fire is red

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.169 
lazy to use spaces see fire is red
that's<00:01:24.159> cool<00:01:27.659> jungle<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:29.079> green<00:01:30.149> isn't<00:01:31.149> that

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
that's cool jungle is green isn't that

you<00:01:36.789> can<00:01:36.970> format<00:01:37.329> your<00:01:37.390> text<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:39.039> do<00:01:39.579> some

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
you can format your text and do some

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.309 
you can format your text and do some
Zelda<00:01:40.479> stuff<00:01:42.420> pull<00:01:43.420> like<00:01:43.599> an<00:01:43.750> ocarina<00:01:43.899> of<00:01:44.259> time

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319

but<00:01:44.860> look<00:01:45.039> this<00:01:45.220> crab<00:01:46.349> it's<00:01:47.349> like<00:01:47.500> spitting

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
but look this crab it's like spitting

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.779 
but look this crab it's like spitting
out<00:01:48.069> crap<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.990> then<00:01:50.140> tanks<00:01:50.530> that's<00:01:51.189> screwed<00:01:51.670> I

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
out crap and then tanks that's screwed I

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.160 
out crap and then tanks that's screwed I
know<00:01:53.250> okay<00:01:54.250> well<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.970> don't<00:01:55.869> think<00:01:55.959> I've<00:01:56.140> ever

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
know okay well I don't think I've ever

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.490 
know okay well I don't think I've ever
shown<00:01:56.709> anything<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.369> game<00:01:57.929> we<00:01:58.929> are<00:01:59.110> moving

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
shown anything of the game we are moving

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.559 
shown anything of the game we are moving
around<00:01:59.619> here<00:02:00.189> here's<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.700> random<00:02:00.939> blob<00:02:01.360> of

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
around here here's a random blob of

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.100 
around here here's a random blob of
items<00:02:02.789> there<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.849> random<00:02:04.179> glob<00:02:04.599> because<00:02:04.990> I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
items there a random glob because I

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.449 
items there a random glob because I
can't<00:02:05.380> actually<00:02:05.500> lay<00:02:05.860> them<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.159> editor

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
can't actually lay them in the editor

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
can't actually lay them in the editor
yet<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.470> just<00:02:08.470> put<00:02:08.799> them<00:02:08.890> all<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.099> 0-0<00:02:09.729> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
yet so I just put them all in 0-0 I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.050 
yet so I just put them all in 0-0 I
turned<00:02:11.319> off<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.530> room<00:02:11.920> collision<00:02:12.640> with<00:02:12.850> that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
turned off the room collision with that

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.920 
turned off the room collision with that
keyboard<00:02:13.299> it's<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.959> debug<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:16.090> yeah

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
keyboard it's like debug because yeah

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.289 
keyboard it's like debug because yeah
it's<00:02:17.109> off<00:02:17.290> right<00:02:17.560> now

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
it's off right now

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.940 
it's off right now
so<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.390> can<00:02:19.510> throw<00:02:19.690> items<00:02:20.109> at<00:02:20.260> each<00:02:20.350> other<00:02:20.680> see

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
so you can throw items at each other see

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.949 
so you can throw items at each other see
I<00:02:21.160> throw<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.769> really<00:02:23.920> hard

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
I throw this there do it really hard

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.379 
I throw this there do it really hard
collisions<00:02:25.959> not<00:02:26.170> perfect<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.940> physics

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
aren't completely realistic but good

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.160 
aren't completely realistic but good
enough<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.380> really<00:02:32.560> care<00:02:32.880> for<00:02:33.880> now

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
enough for now don't really care for now

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.720 
enough for now don't really care for now
see<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.530> throw<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:35.950> into<00:02:36.250> these<00:02:36.459> two

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
see I can throw this into these two

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.550 
see I can throw this into these two
objects<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.290> they<00:02:38.920> transfer<00:02:39.459> physics<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.170> a
