00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.599
 andrea and i am today talk about the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 family being sincere the most important thing 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.760
 for me it's my family I always try and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 we try to have a good relationship 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.529
 between us and good communication 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.920
 although simply sometimes you can not 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.500
 since my parents are separated and I am 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.300
 very difficult to have a good 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 complication with my dad 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 no family is perfect city 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.430
 they have conflicts and problems but 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.250
 they are serious, there is no greater love 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 that of your family although sometimes not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.960
 show it so much the acceptance I 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.719
 call management I know of me is very 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 important to me that's why I 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.760
 He liked a lot of work to say 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 I want there but at the end of accounts 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.470
 it is true what many say they 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.240
 they will take important 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.960
 so take courage and mom I like the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.010
 girls surprisingly or maybe the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.980
 data I already knew he said he loved me but 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.730
 I noticed that they like a lot of work 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.550
 can accept it and it's normal that you do not 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.920
 accept the first one since it is very 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.860
 likely since you were little or 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 little girl they always thought about you 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.420
 they would see at the altar 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.119
 and it's only a matter of time before it 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.720
 join the new idea unfortunately 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:52.060
 there was more touching the subject 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:56.460
 when there is good communication 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.210
 with his parents but time 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.450
 as soon as my dad found out thanks to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.630
 that he did not tell me when I found out 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.270
 I really do get mad but then yes 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.850
 thank you because the prayer I would not have 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.069
 had the courage to say it he accepts 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.290
 but we have never talked about that topic 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.200
 and the brass believe do not weigh you 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.290
 happen because I know it will be a very 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.379
 uncomfortable in my family the only ones that 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.590
 they know 100% are my mom and dad I say to 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:33.280
 100% because my brother my cousins ​​my 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 uncles, my grandparents may have already 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 thought only they have asked me and I 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.900
 I told them the families to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.109
 take care in addition to support all 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.239
 we make mistakes you your mom the dad what 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:50.169
 good your aunt to your cousin your brother you 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.180
 sister everything but forgive their mistakes 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.150
 Leave them in the past you only have one 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.219
 life they enjoy with them ignore their 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.099
 differences and better concentrate on what 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.980
 common and if indeed it is possible that 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.980
 have a good relationship I do not understand 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 but I assure you that if they try they will achieve 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.340
 some change little by little but what 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.680
 will achieve good and we thank you for me 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.470
