00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.880
 tomorrow it will be because warmer again 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.980
 meteorologists have us up to 19 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.749
 degree and that means many 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 Berliners get back on the bike 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.280
 change and that's good because 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.890
 cycling is more environmentally friendly 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.540
 as driving noise poorer and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.340
 simply healthier 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.110
 the more annoying that the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.600
 transport policy still not on the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.370
 increasing number of cyclists 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.200
 has set a clear bike 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.659
 political concept is more than 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:38.179
 overdue says helge oelert cyclist 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:38.179
 in daily street fighting by car 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.160
 who is traveling in this city knows 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.960
 Here, people rise despite the 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.310
 transport policy on the wheel but not 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.490
 that's why they still boast 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.340
 Senate Department for Urban Development 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.070
 if it's a bike town because in twelve 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.390
 and 15 percent of the traffic with the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.059
 bike are covered 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.190
 with a clearly rising tendency the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.500
 we also like to tell the tourists 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.440
 Berlin is an eldorado for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.690
 cyclist with this movie 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.300
 the city presents itself on the internet 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.160
 a generous cycle path network 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.040
 pervades the city ​​and connects everyone 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.900
 important places 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.390
 but reality looks different 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.540
 every two hours an accident in berlin 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.500
 a cyclist 14 died last year 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.009
 year in a ranking of 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.410
 most bicycle friendly cities 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.000
 Germany was beaten off Berlin 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.360
 on place 24 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.920
 welcome to the reality just 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.960
 should the medium at least on 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.560
 a modest four million raised 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.420
 become 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.300
 and there even blocked that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.990
 main committee the experts are one 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.720
 opinion 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.760
 they are each the day before kassel the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.340
 Administrative problems lead to that 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.220
 Actually, this is the beginning of all of us 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.110
 want that in the wild 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.330
 administrations stuck with politics 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.830
 from this affected mode two years 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.970
 you just have to come out now 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.700
 and let's say right now 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.080
 bike policy benno cook knows each other 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.860
 out in political operation 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.230
 he was a volunteer from 2003 to 2009 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.019
 bicycle representative from berlin with a lot 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.830
 he had to know everything 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.230
 administrative decisions check whether 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.519
 you serve the strategic goal 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.380
 promote cycling 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.030
 but for three years there is this 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.250
 no longer post the secretary of state 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.140
 would have something in berlin for superfluous 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.040
 we have many bike officers 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.769
 namely the employees and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.150
 employing female employees 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.950
 that makes no sense anyone like that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.269
 we have all templates again looked at 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.350
 and then he thinks he has one 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.420
 distance right about it 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.049
 in the end decides to doubt, I 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.709
 so I am too 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.220
 bike attendant we have here in 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.650
 this town 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.150
 many thousand problems on the topic 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.080
 Bicycle traffic and the need 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.890
 systematically 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.060
 we will not be able to each other 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.830
 You can do that voluntarily as well 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.480
 do not do it by the way 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.090
 Secretary of State and that's easy 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.940
 insofar certainly say quite as 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.150
 So that we request bicycle traffic 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.070
 and detailed work would be urgently needed 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.380
 traffic light traffic lights 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.780
 keep cyclists at almost every intersection 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.030
 the phases are solely for car drivers 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.080
 aimed at shaking that tempted 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.000
 adhere to behavior 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.670
 Scientists from the institute 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.110
 for urbanism has long been the concepts 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.580
 enable modern traffic control 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.340
 There you could also have better ones 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.880
 traffic lights green wave 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.440
 Induction loops that recognize how 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.760
 many cyclists are still green with it 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.970
 stay until the last one is through and 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.780
 thinking of such things are so 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.580
 Capacity problems lead to this today 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.580
 that stop on the way 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.200
 dodge other soft in the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.730
 driving off and driving others 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.440
 again with red by and so on 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.200
 This partly bad traffic rules 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.810
 is also related to us 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.790
 easy on some already set a lot 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.380
 have early bike traffic for the old one 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.600
 Infrastructure still from the last 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.730
 century held 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.830
 Keyword competence for the expansion of the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.900
 bike paths are the districts responsible 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.060
 but they hardly have any more professionals 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.519
 can take care of it here has the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.739
 City your sustainability downright 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.019
 Broken saved judgment of the traffic club 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.220
 Germany 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.720
 For example, there is very little 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.380
 traffic planner actually in the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.840
 districts 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.250
 that means the money we have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.350
 can not be 100 percent 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.700
 implement and is in recent years 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.490
 it has been so that at least part of the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.200
 could not be spent 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.290
 because of these personnel problems in the 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.030
 Districts st theft in 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.340
 model bike cities like 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.100
 minster there are railway stations on rat 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.640
 parking garages where wheels are stored safely 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.710
 become 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.990
 in Berlin, on the other hand, s and u 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.840
 train stations mostly chaos and 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.450
 Crime every day will be 72 wheels 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.250
 Stolen 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.630
 So a strategic story 50 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.470
 bike stations to the berliner 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.800
 stations 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.610
 then the topic would be today again 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.919
 really hum 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.490
 but especially missing for the departure 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.770
 the big ideas 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.560
 Like other cities you have for London 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.810
 For example, Norman Forster has the vision of one 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.030
 network of bike highways designed 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.910
 or the 200,000 inhabitants of the city 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.460
 Eindhoven crossing this one 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.590
 busy road intersection was the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.009
 there politicians eleven million euros 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.520
 worth as much as that about 20 times bigger 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.740
 Berlin 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.909
 in almost three years for the whole 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:35.250
 bike removal invested in let us 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.169
 Meanwhile , the big decision makers in 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.590
 big sled through the city 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.590
 drive and plan big motorways 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.530
 while the cyclists too often 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.610
 on bad and too narrow 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.500
 because of urge 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.260
 obviously cycling is for berliner 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.480
 politician not sexy House of Representatives 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.860
 who confesses to it and so we say 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.800
 want to promote bicycle now 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.110
 that is yes then the bike has say 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.750
 now that way and that 's easy 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.610
 not that is not mainstream to say 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.720
 in the House of Representatives or in the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.510
 appropriate bodies 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.000
 we are doing the right traffic policy now 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.310
 and so one lets oneself of the presumed ones 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.650
 car driver interests in the bockshorn 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.180
 to hunt 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.070
 You can ring a bell somewhere 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.480
 and there are actually too many questions 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.790
 space for outside too little space for 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.590
 bikers there they will certainly 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.670
 different the new feature 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.840
 they are in politics 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.160
 responsibility yes we are in the 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.240
 political responsibility must be yes 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.700
 see that we are for the city society 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.590
 We find a total solution with which we 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.350
 can also go along and where they are 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.910
 can adjust changes well there 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.340
 wants the traffic responsible 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.690
 state secretary, apparently, not so 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.750
 leaning out of the window a pity 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.750
 actually
