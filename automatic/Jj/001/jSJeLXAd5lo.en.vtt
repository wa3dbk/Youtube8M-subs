everything that I did down here on the
fifth<00:04:18.410> fret<00:04:18.590> should<00:04:19.010> work<00:04:19.310> here<00:04:19.910> now<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.169> D

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
fifth fret should work here now in the D

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.320 
fifth fret should work here now in the D
position<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:22.430> I'm<00:04:22.490> gonna<00:04:22.580> do<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.760> same<00:04:23.030> exact

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
position so I'm gonna do that same exact

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.150 
position so I'm gonna do that same exact
look<00:04:27.610> while<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.729> D<00:04:28.880> chord<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.240> in<00:04:29.300> play<00:04:30.160> then

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
look while that D chord is in play then

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.620 
look while that D chord is in play then
when<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> chord<00:04:31.910> comes<00:04:32.060> back<00:04:32.300> into<00:04:32.570> the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
when the a chord comes back into the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.050 
when the a chord comes back into the
progression<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:35.560> can<00:04:36.560> go<00:04:37.430> right<00:04:37.610> back<00:04:37.639> into<00:04:37.940> the

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
progression I can go right back into the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.170 
progression I can go right back into the
first<00:04:38.210> position<00:04:38.560> ok<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:40.039> e<00:04:40.070> chord<00:04:40.550> will<00:04:41.030> come

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
first position ok the e chord will come

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.360 
first position ok the e chord will come
into<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.449> progression<00:04:41.870> but<00:04:42.650> with<00:04:42.830> usually

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
into the progression but with usually

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.330 
into the progression but with usually
for<00:04:43.550> four<00:04:43.729> beats<00:04:43.850> one<00:04:44.180> two<00:04:44.660> three<00:04:45.289> four<00:04:45.800> before

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
for four beats one two three four before

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.250 
for four beats one two three four before
going<00:04:46.460> back<00:04:46.639> into<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:46.910> D<00:04:47.150> chord<00:04:47.479> for<00:04:48.110> four

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
going back into the D chord for four

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.960 
going back into the D chord for four
beats<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.889> there<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.400> shorten<00:04:49.699> this

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
beats so there I can just shorten this

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.240 
beats so there I can just shorten this
lick<00:04:50.240> up<00:04:53.229> no<00:04:54.229> hammer<00:04:54.500> on<00:04:54.680> business<00:04:55.010> at<00:04:55.099> all<00:04:55.220> I

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
can do the same thing over that four

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.029 
can do the same thing over that four
beats<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:57.169> D<00:04:57.380> major<00:04:57.560> as<00:04:57.770> well
