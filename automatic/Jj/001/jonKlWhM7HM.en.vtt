00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
back in the day but now it seems that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.770 
back in the day but now it seems that
they're<00:01:27.210> inspired<00:01:27.600> by<00:01:27.750> Rayman<00:01:28.140> Origins<00:01:29.780> now

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
they're inspired by Rayman Origins now
if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.040> now<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.400> just

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
if you think about it right now or just

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.539 
if you think about it right now or just
actually<00:01:32.790> did<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.540> well<00:01:33.750> because

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
actually did so well because

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.249 
actually did so well because
Rayman<00:01:35.549> started<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> sides<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.930> 2d

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
Rayman started off as a sides a 2d

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
Rayman started off as a sides a 2d
side-scroller<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> comes<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> tie

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
side-scroller but when it comes to tie

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
side-scroller but when it comes to tie
it<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.930> doesn't<00:01:40.170> fit<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.860> started

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it just doesn't fit because he started

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.600 
it just doesn't fit because he started
as<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.540> 3d<00:01:42.540> platformer<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> ps2<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
as a 3d platformer for the ps2 and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.969 
as a 3d platformer for the ps2 and
GameCube<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.360> Xbox<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.530> gonna<00:01:46.710> say

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
GameCube and Xbox but I'm just gonna say

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.639 
GameCube and Xbox but I'm just gonna say
like<00:01:47.189> PlayStation<00:01:48.119> 2<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.630> most<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.500> these

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
like PlayStation 2 because most of these

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.170 
like PlayStation 2 because most of these
multi<00:01:50.040> platform<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.610> actually<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:51.000> their

tablets
I'm<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.050> two<00:02:10.170> percent<00:02:10.289> sure<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:10.800> it's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
I'm not one two percent sure if it's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.530 
I'm not one two percent sure if it's
gonna<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.370> iOS<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.060> pretty<00:02:12.270> sure<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
gonna be for iOS but I'm pretty sure it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.900 
gonna be for iOS but I'm pretty sure it
will<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.069> me<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.459> doesn't<00:02:14.640> really

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
will be but to me it just doesn't really

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.100 
will be but to me it just doesn't really
seem<00:02:15.209> like<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> full<00:02:16.099> true<00:02:17.099> reboot<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
seem like a full true reboot that the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.690 
seem like a full true reboot that the
tiger<00:02:19.379> Tasmanian<00:02:20.010> tiger<00:02:20.310> fans<00:02:20.520> deserve

tiger Tasmanian tiger fans deserve

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.670 
tiger Tasmanian tiger fans deserve
because<00:02:21.180> when<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.540> first<00:02:21.750> heard<00:02:22.020> about<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.470> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
because when I first heard about this I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.660 
because when I first heard about this I
was<00:02:22.770> excited<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:24.000> my<00:02:24.150> expect

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
was excited but my expect

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.059 
was excited but my expect
my<00:02:26.670> expectations<00:02:27.300> were<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.690> bad<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.200> my

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
my expectations were kind of bad and my

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.000 
my expectations were kind of bad and my
hopes<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:29.760> click<00:02:29.970> down<00:02:30.379> chrome<00:02:31.379> just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
hopes would just click down chrome just

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
hopes would just click down chrome just
basically<00:02:32.519> gave<00:02:32.730> us<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.970> little<00:02:33.150> finger<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
basically gave us a little finger to the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.540 
basically gave us a little finger to the
fence<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.800> they<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.190> want<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.400> try

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
fence because they know you want to try

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.040 
fence because they know you want to try
for<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.180> they<00:02:36.239> know<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.690> wanted

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
for it and they know that we wanted

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.369 
for it and they know that we wanted
another<00:02:37.709> 3d<00:02:38.160> platformer<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.200> there's<00:02:40.200> more

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
another 3d platformer but there's more

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.869 
another 3d platformer but there's more
hope<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:40.950> there<00:02:40.980> might<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.489> tighter

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
hope because there might be a tighter

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.820 
hope because there might be a tighter
