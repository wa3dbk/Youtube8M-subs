00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.810 
different from the type that the u.s.
uses<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.520> use<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:16.369> plastic<00:01:17.369> type

uses they use kind of the plastic type
mount<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.439> have

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
mount I think all right here we have

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
mount I think all right here we have
these<00:01:20.549> connectors<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.080> can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
these connectors and I think you can

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.840 
these connectors and I think you can
hook<00:01:22.350> them<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> goggles<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> stuff<00:01:23.700> like

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
hook them up to goggles and stuff like

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.480 
hook them up to goggles and stuff like
that<00:01:23.970> they're<00:01:24.119> basically<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.689> retention

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
that they're basically just retention

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.810 
that they're basically just retention
retention<00:01:26.490> straps<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:28.110> also<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.820> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
retention straps here we also have this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.940 
retention straps here we also have this
which<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.810> gas<00:01:30.990> masks<00:01:31.290> -<00:01:31.530> not

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
which i think is for gas masks - not

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
which i think is for gas masks - not
entirely<00:01:32.549> certain<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.360> comes<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
entirely certain but it comes out it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.270 
entirely certain but it comes out it
says<00:01:35.299> head<00:01:36.299> lock<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:37.320> there

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 

the<00:01:41.520> helmet<00:01:41.850> did<00:01:42.060> come<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> install<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the helmet did come with the install the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
the helmet did come with the install the
pre-installed<00:01:43.710> arc<00:01:43.980> rails<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.640> think

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
pre-installed arc rails which I think

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.670

just<00:01:45.060> make<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.600> awesome<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.500> looks

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
just make it look awesome it looks

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.400 
first I thought that these were actually
goggle<00:01:59.729> strips<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.750> Google<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.260> back

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
goggle strips like Google on the back

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.230 
goggle strips like Google on the back
they<00:02:01.619> are<00:02:01.650> not<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.190> guess<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.910> have<00:02:03.000> really

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
they are not I guess if you have really

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
they are not I guess if you have really
thin<00:02:03.510> goggle<00:02:03.930> straps<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> used<00:02:04.800> as

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
thin goggle straps they can be used as

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
thin goggle straps they can be used as
goggle<00:02:05.310> straps<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.670> these<00:02:05.850> are<00:02:05.970> actually<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
goggle straps but these are actually the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.230 
goggle straps but these are actually the
tension<00:02:07.170> system<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.520> rear<00:02:08.729> thing<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
tension system for the rear thing that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.639 
tension system for the rear thing that
goes<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.509> against<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> back<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.080> your<00:02:10.140> head<00:02:10.350> so

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
goes up against the back of your head so

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.710 
goes up against the back of your head so

velcro head you pull off with an
adhesive<00:03:28.310> strip<00:03:28.700> like<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:29.569> you<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.110> peel<00:03:30.800> off

with<00:06:00.460> this<00:06:00.870> maybe<00:06:01.870> even<00:06:02.140> a<00:06:02.290> tax<00:06:02.500> FG<00:06:02.890> but<00:06:03.370> uh<00:06:03.400> you

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
with this maybe even a tax FG but uh you

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.670 
with this maybe even a tax FG but uh you
can<00:06:04.150> experiment<00:06:04.420> with<00:06:04.630> it<00:06:04.720> and<00:06:04.870> I<00:06:05.140> think<00:06:05.230> OD<00:06:05.530> is

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
can experiment with it and I think OD is

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.400 
can experiment with it and I think OD is
kind<00:06:05.950> of<00:06:05.980> just<00:06:06.130> a<00:06:06.250> universal<00:06:06.760> color<00:06:06.880> so<00:06:07.540> not

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
kind of just a universal color so not

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.710 
kind of just a universal color so not
really<00:06:08.680> any<00:06:08.860> constants<00:06:09.490> besides<00:06:09.880> the<00:06:10.150> fact

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
really any constants besides the fact

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.590 
really any constants besides the fact
that<00:06:10.840> takes<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.770> while<00:06:12.040> to<00:06:12.070> adjust<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.850> then<00:06:12.910> it

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
that takes a while to adjust and then it

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000 
that takes a while to adjust and then it
is<00:06:13.780> kind<00:06:13.990> of<00:06:14.050> uncomfortable<00:06:14.380> these<00:06:14.800> things

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
that other kind I think it's kind of

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.510 
that other kind I think it's kind of
really<00:06:24.460> it's<00:06:25.390> like<00:06:25.800> flat<00:06:26.800> ish<00:06:27.130> I<00:06:27.400> was

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
really it's like flat ish I was

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.850 
really it's like flat ish I was
expecting<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.060> to<00:06:28.150> be<00:06:28.180> more<00:06:28.420> of<00:06:28.480> like<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.860> curved

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
expecting it to be more of like a curved

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.220 
expecting it to be more of like a curved
top<00:06:30.220> but<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:31.090> actually<00:06:31.210> like<00:06:31.510> that<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.840> provides

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
top but I actually like that it provides

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.140 
top but I actually like that it provides
a<00:06:32.320> lower<00:06:32.440> profile<00:06:32.920> it's<00:06:33.130> not<00:06:33.250> like<00:06:33.340> a<00:06:33.400> Mitch<00:06:33.550> mm

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
a lower profile it's not like a Mitch mm

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.510 
a lower profile it's not like a Mitch mm
or<00:06:34.300> that<00:06:34.450> use<00:06:34.630> stick<00:06:35.470> out<00:06:35.650> over<00:06:35.920> the<00:06:36.010> sides<00:06:36.220> and

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
or that use stick out over the sides and

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.430 
or that use stick out over the sides and
it's<00:06:36.670> just<00:06:36.820> kind<00:06:37.000> of<00:06:37.030> a<00:06:37.210> big<00:06:37.690> bulky<00:06:38.140> helmet

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
it's just kind of a big bulky helmet

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.440 
it's just kind of a big bulky helmet
this<00:06:38.590> is<00:06:38.650> kind<00:06:38.920> of<00:06:38.950> a<00:06:39.070> high<00:06:39.250> speed<00:06:39.310> type<00:06:39.790> looks

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
this is kind of a high speed type looks

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.080 
this is kind of a high speed type looks
just<00:06:40.690> like<00:06:40.870> the<00:06:41.050> fast<00:06:41.530> helmet<00:06:41.890> except<00:06:42.280> for<00:06:42.640> it

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
just like the fast helmet except for it

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.450 
just like the fast helmet except for it
has<00:06:43.330> this<00:06:44.020> temple<00:06:44.470> protector<00:06:44.890> which<00:06:45.100> I<00:06:45.250> think

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
has this temple protector which I think

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.910 
has this temple protector which I think
kind<00:06:46.030> of<00:06:46.120> adds<00:06:46.270> a<00:06:46.420> cool<00:06:46.630> element<00:06:47.200> to<00:06:47.290> it<00:06:47.410> and<00:06:47.590> it

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
kind of adds a cool element to it and it
