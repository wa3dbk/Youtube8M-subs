00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.500
 in the following sections we will study 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.889
 some techniques to count how many 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.809
 elements has a set the problem 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.870
 arises when applying the definition of 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.070
 classic probability remember that the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.350
 classic probability of an event 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.350
 it is defined as this quotient 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.690
 cardinal and dad 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.470
 / cardinal and that the omega 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.020
 in cases when the sample space 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.400
 of the random experiment is a set 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 finite and probable x 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.940
 the question is how to know how many 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 elements has an event 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.890
 we will see then some techniques of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.000
 I count one of the most useful results 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.000
 It is the following 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.310
 then without procedure a can 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.530
 be done in different ways 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.649
 and a second procedure that can 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.360
 be done in different ways 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.829
 then the total ways you can 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.789
 perform the first procedure 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.010
 followed by the second is the product of n 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.820
 by n 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.820
 that is to say 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 if it is already a set 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.899
 of carnality n 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.820
 and go is another set 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.000
 carnality m 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.519
 then this principle of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.069
 multiplication can be expressed from the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.069
 next form carnality 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.400
 the cartesian product of a with cross ba 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 b 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.160
 this is carnality 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.069
 of the set consisting of couples 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.080
 ordered 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.490
 such that is an element of a 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.730
 and see is an element must 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.730
 is equal to the carnality of a 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:59.320
 for the cardinal and dad 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.320
 must this is the product n by m 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.310
 graphically we have the following 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.310
 situation 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.130
 in this tree we have these first n 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.160
 nodes corresponding to the elements 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.630
 of the set ay for each of these 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.750
 nodes we have n possibilities that are 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.910
 the elements of the set b of such 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.690
 way that this tree shows 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.430
 a total of nm full routes to go 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.180
 from left or right or vienna and nm 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.180
 complete branches 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.760
 let's see a simple example of 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.450
 application of this principle of 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.450
 multiplication 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.560
 we have then that in a pizzeria the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.549
 Basic type pizzas are presented in 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.609
 Small and medium sized sizes and with 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.090
 one of ten ingredients the question is 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.430
 how many basic pizzas can be offered 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.449
 well it's not very difficult to find the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.449
 answer to this question 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.030
 and this is the next then we have 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 three possible sizes or three possible 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.220
 ways in which this procedure 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.789
 It can be done followed by the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.009
 flavor procedure that can be done 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.540
 of ten different ways in such a way 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.630
 that 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.470
 answer to the question is 3 x 10 equal 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.800
 to 30 basic pizzas that can be 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.800
 offer 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.020
 the multiplication principle can 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.330
 extend to three or more procedures 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.160
 one followed by the other the result is 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.160
 You can express it in the following way 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:32.050
 then the multiplication principle 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.050
 extended states that carnality 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:41.230
 this product Cartesian to 1 cross to 2 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:43.460
 etc 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.550
 until 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.820
 n 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.520
 is equal to carnality 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.420
 from one to one 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.200
 for the cardinal and dad 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.450
 from a2 etc. 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.450
 until the carnality 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.650
 we are going to apply this result in a 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.650
 particular case 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.169
 in this example we have a team 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.630
 particular football will play m matches 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.280
 in each of which you can lose 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:29.669
 draw or win are three possibilities 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.770
 we ask the following how many 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.240
 different forms can be presented 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.220
 results of these games 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.460
 Well the answer then is the 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.460
 following 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:49.900
 for the first procedure or first 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:52.240
 party we have three possibilities for 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:57.510
 the second procedure three more 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:00.740
 possibilities and so on up to a total of 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.740
 in my factors 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:10.060
 so that the answer is 3 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.060
 in the air 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.540
 in this case the m procedures have 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.540
 the same cardinal and that 3 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.720
 in the following sections we will apply 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.280
 this principle of multiplication in the 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.700
 several counting techniques that 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.160
 we will review in general the problems in 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.860
 where you need to know how many 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.830
 elements has a set are not 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.450
 easy to solve but it's very likely 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.090
 that this principle of 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:44.400
 multiplication and some combination of 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.120
 the formulas that we will study in the 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.120
 following sections
