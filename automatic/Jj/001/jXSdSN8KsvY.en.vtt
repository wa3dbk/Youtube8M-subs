when<00:00:10.890> you<00:00:10.980> look<00:00:11.100> at<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.400> sketches<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.880> we've

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
when you look at the sketches that we've

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.180 
when you look at the sketches that we've
got<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.230> exploration<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:13.980> did

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
got and the exploration that we did

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.099 
got and the exploration that we did
nobody<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:14.970> holding<00:00:15.300> back<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.720> think<00:00:15.810> from<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
nobody was holding back I think from the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.570 
nobody was holding back I think from the
very<00:00:16.290> beginning<00:00:16.620> really<00:00:16.770> went<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.280> to<00:00:17.400> try

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
very beginning really went for it to try

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.480 
very beginning really went for it to try
to<00:00:17.640> take<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.510> car<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.870> new<00:00:19.020> place<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:23.160> cars

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
to take the car to a new place the cars

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.190 
to take the car to a new place the cars
been<00:00:23.730> transformed<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.930> whole<00:00:25.080> new

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
been transformed it's a whole new

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.080 
been transformed it's a whole new
statement<00:00:25.620> for<00:00:25.770> Corvette<00:00:28.580> this<00:00:29.580> time<00:00:29.850> around

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
statement for Corvette this time around

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
statement for Corvette this time around
we<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.800> invited<00:00:31.800> manufacturing<00:00:32.340> into

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
we actually invited manufacturing into

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130 
we actually invited manufacturing into
the<00:00:32.640> design<00:00:32.910> studio<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> initial

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the design studio so from the initial

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.390 
the design studio so from the initial
sketches<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.070> you've<00:00:35.160> already<00:00:35.280> seen

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
sketches that you've already seen

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.830 
sketches that you've already seen
through<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> where<00:00:36.570> we're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
through to where we're going to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540 
through to where we're going to
production<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.620> lost<00:00:37.829> nothing<00:00:38.250> because

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
production we lost nothing because

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.090 
production we lost nothing because
everybody<00:00:39.030> worked<00:00:39.210> together<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> team

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
everybody worked together as a team

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
everybody worked together as a team
without<00:00:41.100> engineering<00:00:42.090> without<00:00:42.270> design<00:00:42.630> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
without engineering without design and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.210 
without engineering without design and
the<00:00:42.989> manufacturing<00:00:43.530> guys<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.890> would<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
the manufacturing guys we would not have

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:52.430 
the manufacturing guys we would not have
got<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> center<00:00:44.790> area

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.600 

one<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.590> biggest<00:00:53.860> things<00:00:54.070> was<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.400> wanted

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
one of the biggest things was we wanted

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.890 
one of the biggest things was we wanted
to<00:00:54.730> really<00:00:54.880> show<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.180> craftsmanship<00:00:55.570> the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
to really show the craftsmanship the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.540 
to really show the craftsmanship the
handbill<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.560> stitching<00:00:57.190> design-wise

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
handbill the stitching design-wise

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.000 
handbill the stitching design-wise
everything<00:00:58.270> is<00:00:58.390> more<00:00:58.510> interior<00:00:58.810> focused<00:00:59.350> you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
everything is more interior focused you

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.920 
everything is more interior focused you
had<00:01:00.190> these<00:01:00.400> lines<00:01:00.700> they<00:01:01.210> would<00:01:01.330> flow<00:01:01.660> across

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
had these lines they would flow across

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.420 
had these lines they would flow across
the<00:01:02.140> IP<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:02.980> would<00:01:03.070> see<00:01:03.400> that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
the IP and you would see that

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.130 
the IP and you would see that
craftsmanship<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.150> stitching<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.080> you

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
craftsmanship that stitching so you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.210 
craftsmanship that stitching so you
could<00:01:05.350> literally<00:01:05.620> picture<00:01:06.040> something

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
could literally picture something

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:18.270 
could literally picture something
stitching<00:01:06.730> that<00:01:06.850> onto<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.120> leather<00:01:17.280> there's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
stitching that onto that leather there's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.180 
stitching that onto that leather there's
literally<00:01:18.940> no<00:01:19.150> part<00:01:19.630> no<00:01:20.020> surface<00:01:20.650> that<00:01:20.830> wasn't

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
literally no part no surface that wasn't

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.540 
literally no part no surface that wasn't
thought<00:01:21.460> about<00:01:21.840> evaluated<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.550> really

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
thought about evaluated and really

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.430 
thought about evaluated and really
changed<00:01:25.240> your<00:01:25.450> experiencing<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.080> car<00:01:26.229> from

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
changed your experiencing the car from

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.650 
changed your experiencing the car from
the<00:01:26.530> inside<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.250> has<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.610> be<00:01:27.790> tailored<00:01:28.479> to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
the inside so it has to be tailored to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.820 
the inside so it has to be tailored to
you<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.140> have<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.380> be<00:01:29.470> able<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.740> adjust

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
you you have to be able to adjust

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.170 
you you have to be able to adjust
everything<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.670> have<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:30.820> able<00:01:30.910> to<00:01:31.030> reach

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
everything you have to able to reach

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.030 
everything you have to able to reach
everything<00:01:31.450> see<00:01:31.840> everything<00:01:31.950> everything<00:01:32.950> has

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
everything see everything everything has

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.290 
everything see everything everything has
to<00:01:33.130> be<00:01:33.190> very<00:01:33.220> clear<00:01:33.580> all<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.850> instrumentation

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
to be very clear all the instrumentation

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.480 
to be very clear all the instrumentation
and<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:35.320> has<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.530> be<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> nice<00:01:35.830> place<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.190> be<00:01:36.340> as

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
and it has to be a nice place to be as

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.100 
and it has to be a nice place to be as
have<00:01:36.760> nice<00:01:36.910> materials<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.810> has<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.050> be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
we really wanted the car to be focused

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.860
