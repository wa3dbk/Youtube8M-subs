ALLISON SPRINGER:
I'm Allison Springer.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:03.690
I am a three day event rider.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.020
I'm looking forward to
the Olympics next year.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.460
I've had a fantastic
year so far.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.700
We just came from
Tallahassee, Florida,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.340
from Red Hills, which
Arthur and I won.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.310
We're really excited
about that, and hoping

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.770
to lay down some good results
in this pre-Olympic year.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.250
GRACE: Hi, I'm Grace.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.610
I'm from outside
Chicago, and I've

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.610
been working for Allison
now since the beginning

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.780
of the year.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.930
And my job in the
barn is just kind

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.770
of keeping things
running smoothly,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.480
in charge of the
horses, students,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.280
and obviously going to
the shows, doing all that.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.700
Helping her win.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.470
ALLISON SPRINGER:
Destination Known

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.960
is my other advanced horse,
and we affectionately

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.560
call him Burger, which is a
very fitting name for him.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.530
He is full of joy
and exuberance,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.400
and so it's really fun to
have him back in action.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.855
He'll be heading to Rolex
this year, along with Arthur.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.144
He loves his jumping.

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:06.550
He loves it so much.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.455
He's quite good at
dressage, but doesn't

00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:10.080
seem to love it quite
as much, so we're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.700
working on the exuberance
in that department as well.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.440
I've been using the SmartPak
system for a couple of years

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.440
now.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.450
I love it for a number
of different reasons.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.810
The first thing that really
turned me on to SmartPak,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.530
actually, was the
staff at SmartPak,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.420
and how wonderful they are to
work with, how knowledgeable

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.380
they are.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.840
I guess probably one of my
biggest concerns in the barn

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.230
is making sure my equine
partners are able to operate

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.880
at their highest level.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.780
And each horse has
individual needs,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.850
and I think working with
the staff at SmartPak,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
they were able to help me
cater a program for each

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.740
of my horses.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.720
So I love the staff at SmartPak.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.420
Very knowledgeable,
very friendly.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.830
Just a great group to figure
out what your horse needs.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.770
GRACE: I think it's just a huge
help, as far as it's so, like,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.710
easy to store, it's easy to make
the tack room look organized.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.265
You know, they're all in
their boxes, it's pre-labeled.

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:16.890
And I think it helps, too, just
with like, new working students

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.640
coming in and out.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.840
It's so easy to
explain and, you know,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.480
you just read the horse's
name, put it in the bucket,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.505
and it's all right there,
and it takes a second,

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:25.880
and you don't have
to be going in

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.490
and out of different
supplement boxes, and all that.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.120
So I think it just makes
everything faster and simpler.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.670
ALLISON SPRINGER: Obviously
I love having-- knowing,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.280
the confidence knowing that
the supplements that we feed

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.350
are fresh, they're
of the right dose.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.361
It's organized.

00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.860
We know that the
animals are getting

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.960
what they need every day.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.742
That's a huge-- you know, it's
just a huge worry taken off

00:02:52.742 --> 00:02:53.367
your shoulders.

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:55.940

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.920
I did wear my Charles Owen
helmet in the dressage phase

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.450
at Rolex this past year.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.020
Head injury has been something
that's been in my life.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.330
Not me personally,
but my brother,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.850
my only brother passed
away due to head trauma.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.310
My very best friend was
in a riding accident

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.930
and had severe head trauma,
and has recovered well.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.940
But it's something that
I've thought a lot about.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.450
And what I do love about
that is that it resonated

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.780
with a lot of people, and I
got a lot of wonderful emails

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.360
from people that always
wanted to wear their helmet,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.380
but didn't because
no one else was.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.727
So I think that was neat, that
it gave a lot of other people

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:41.560
the confidence that,
well, I can do it, too.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.670
So it had a great
end result. Well,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.827
Rolex is such an amazing event.

00:03:50.827 --> 00:03:52.410
It's obviously the
biggest competition

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.270
we have in this country, and
there is a lot of atmosphere.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.550
Actually, the main
arena at Rolex, I think,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.100
is a much more challenging
arena than Burghley, Blenheim,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.840
and Badinton.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.510
Any of those.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.770
There's a whole
lot of atmosphere,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.010
and the horses do
get quite nervous.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.150
So this will be Burger's
first time there,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.170
and he actually gets-- he gets
nervous and a little spooky,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.490
too.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.760
I'm gonna spend a good
amount of time on Wednesday

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.910
night when we do get to have
familiarization in that arena,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.160
around the dressage arena.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.751
I'll spend a good amount
of time with him in there,

00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:32.250
just letting him
settle and get used

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.590
to-- he's a horse
that doesn't actually

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.040
do really well with a lot
of pre-rides for dressage.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.010
He's actually one
that you kind of have

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.470
to warm up and go in the arena.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.620
Arthur's a pre-ride horse.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.320
Every time, he can go out.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.460
There's no tiring Arthur out,
but he is sort of a mama's boy,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.460
and he does get nervous.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.680
So every time he makes
it back to home base,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.120
he gets into the stall and
can take a deep breath,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.905
he's so much better and more
relaxed the next time out.

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:10.430
So he gets to go out riding
more frequently, probably,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.960
than Burger.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.710
The biggest thing is the
lead up to getting them

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.750
in the dressage ring.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.580
To produce your best test
in the dressage at Rolex.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.900
It's a big effort.
