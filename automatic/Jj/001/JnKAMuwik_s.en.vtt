00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.650
 a blender or some kind of kitchen 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.810
 the harvester can finally be grated 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
 and and rub 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.130
 the main thing that it turned out homogeneous 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 a lot of strawberries is easy to do 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.350
 saint strawberries 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 crushed or rubbed what did you do there 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:40.409

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 stirred 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.460
 The rest of the sugar was also added. 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:25.890
 after being prevented by a glass of sugar 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.890
 can taste 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.660
 sweet enough in my opinion 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:48.350
 sugar is still dissolved well, that's basically 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.350
 and all 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.410
 here we all pour it into a jar 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.810
 exactly half a liter jar turned out 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.140
 let it slip to the eyeballs 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.700
 we will cover this jar with a beautiful one 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:18.400
 lid and in this form put in 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.860
 the fridge is the coldest place and winter 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.100

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.000
 live it you can spread it on bread and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.400
 food to them if in doubt 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.610
 your refrigeratorâ€™s abilities are better 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.890
 put it in the freezer so it will be safer 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.150
 it can ferment if you have a fridge 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.000
 it does not cool very well in the freezer 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.180
