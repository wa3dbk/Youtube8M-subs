00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
 ae 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.620
 I'll be back in the area. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.600
 I'm here at the music institute that 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.370
 take my name in curitiba paranÃ¡ 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.250
 recording the video then the criterion of 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.170
 tyco for you is a beginner in the technique of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.330
 and for you who already play too 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.920
 to give an up in his technique remembering 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.050
 that my life 'your imagination endemol 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 just to comment with you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.410
 It's a huge pleasure to be back at 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.629
 Current returning to Dorca economy and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.040
 participating in this fantastic team of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.730
 brazilian guitarists 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.540
 thanks people are starting with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.790
 Earth 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.129
 I show here the right way then 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.589
 apply with the right hand on the way there 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.769
 come on then right hold the palette 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.570
 correctly that part of the hand will you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.330
 support the most severe chords 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.490
 the middle finger to your right hand will be 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.409
 hitting here on the second rope 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.409
 I call this seesaw movement 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 seesaw movement 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.409
 Why do not you use your arm? 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 When you use your arm, you'll leave 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 the loose strings will automatically foul 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.750
 The sun then the correct one is that you 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.520
 work very accurately with 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.560
 the middle finger pushing the rope to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.579
 down or up 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.579
 the sun 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 i 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.520
 we will also work with house 5 and 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.469
 house 8 in left hand 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.929
 Let's work this roof in Teresina. 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.560
 three new ones per time to facilitate your 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.549
 life 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.530
 always carry the magic word circle 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.159
 circle like circus 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.159
 Let's go to OPEC 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.100
 What is a good sound for? 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.550
 Interesting article of your time in the house 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.050
 12 house 13 house 10 will give you a 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.270
 sound interesting to you that 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.270
 it's beginning can animate the people ii 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:40.190
 The labor market in all the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.190
 effective because you handle mechanics is 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 Hey 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.440
 i and ii 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.470
 with the same earth technique 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.830
 let's think now within the scale of 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.350
 Your mother, let's go, watch the farm. 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.140
 fourth the third rope and the second rope 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.580
 with the same time teaches 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 but in the second final rope of this 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.190
 exercise generates a pedal can with terry 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.950
 very interesting notice in my hand that 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.960
 I'll be doing only toe in one 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.150
 Note mothers here in hand Note 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.850
 left hand pepe left hand 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.480
 Look, I'm only going to do very well. 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.480
 i 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.980
 i 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 i 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.470
 i 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:14.390
 and we will now fight both hands in the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.390
 sixth string tape rope 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:28.690
 i fourth string ii 3rd agrees ii 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.690
 i second string ii 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.530
 this whole example is down here in the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.610
 table height and sheet music accompany 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.610
 now it's general 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.889
 i 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.849
 who is him 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.099
 now at normal speed 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:05.099
 accelerate ii 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:20.039
 who you are and who you are. 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:22.560
 greater knowledge to set apart a stretch 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.110
 of my music called mirim that counts 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.719
 with the nice legends and the partridge with 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.370
 Rope jump more should show that 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.129
 separately four challenges that I will 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.529
 're using the same is the quartet 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.550
 7 shadows using the third and fifth 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:45.090
 first rope 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:55.590
 follow here with example remember now 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:58.370
 I see what I have been doing for a minute . 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.370
 knife 17 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.320
 this is where I see Tokyo time 17 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.850
 the sea and to have the seventh 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.850
 simon on the right hand 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:23.020
 this is nice if you study this 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.690
 a slow way with the metronome and goes 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.280
 accelerating it gradually you 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.170
 reach a very good result 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.360
 as I told you and to protect the 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.460
 my song called medinho perform 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.830
 now notice that we have a time and 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.990
 also palette as well if so 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.820
 use the right hand weight in the 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:46.360
 tep-shaped devices 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:48.930
 This way we 're going to show you 're in the 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.930
 end of it all 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.990
