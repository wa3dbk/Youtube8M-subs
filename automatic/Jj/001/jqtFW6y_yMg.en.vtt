and I'm like gosh it feels amazing

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.649 
and I'm like gosh it feels amazing
because<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.099> know<00:00:16.219> what<00:00:16.429> it's<00:00:17.029> starting<00:00:17.539> to

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:17.659 
because you know what it's starting to

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.259 
because you know what it's starting to
turn<00:00:17.900> autumn<00:00:18.829> and<00:00:19.039> my<00:00:19.699> favorite<00:00:20.029> time<00:00:20.179> of<00:00:20.210> the

year<00:00:20.329> is<00:00:20.569> full<00:00:20.839> of<00:00:21.019> course<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:21.640> so<00:00:22.640> I<00:00:22.669> thought

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
year is full of course and so I thought

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.149 
year is full of course and so I thought
how<00:00:23.359> you<00:00:23.419> start<00:00:23.749> making<00:00:24.109> some<00:00:24.289> decorations<00:00:25.009> to

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:25.159 
how you start making some decorations to

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.179 
how you start making some decorations to
decorate<00:00:25.489> the<00:00:25.579> house<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.689> I<00:00:26.739> don't<00:00:27.739> share<00:00:28.069> this

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
decorate the house so I don't share this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.880 
decorate the house so I don't share this
with<00:00:28.339> you<00:00:28.519> I<00:00:28.789> know<00:00:29.269> you<00:00:29.960> probably<00:00:30.289> keep<00:00:30.710> these

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
with you I know you probably keep these

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.980 
with you I know you probably keep these
bags<00:00:31.099> just<00:00:31.369> because<00:00:31.699> they're<00:00:31.849> they<00:00:32.599> tend<00:00:32.960> to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
bags just because they're they tend to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.200 
bags just because they're they tend to
be<00:00:33.110> kind<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.320> expensive<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.490> you<00:00:34.760> ever<00:00:35.090> get

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
be kind of expensive but you ever get

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.760 
be kind of expensive but you ever get
these<00:00:35.330> Christmas<00:00:35.720> bags<00:00:35.960> like<00:00:36.350> at<00:00:36.620> Christmas

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
these Christmas bags like at Christmas

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.070 
these Christmas bags like at Christmas
time<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.220> people<00:00:37.780> presents<00:00:38.780> in<00:00:38.870> them<00:00:38.990> but

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
time and people presents in them but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.780 
time and people presents in them but
they<00:00:39.170> don't<00:00:39.350> really<00:00:39.440> write<00:00:39.740> on<00:00:39.950> them<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:40.730> you

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
they don't really write on them so you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.510 
they don't really write on them so you
save<00:00:41.270> them<00:00:41.420> for<00:00:41.630> next<00:00:41.660> year<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:42.380> can<00:00:42.560> wrap

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
save them for next year and you can wrap

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.120 
save them for next year and you can wrap
them<00:00:43.760> for<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.000> gift<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.540> give<00:00:44.720> away<00:00:45.130> if

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
you can vary but I think it's a great

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.540 
you can vary but I think it's a great
color<00:00:59.810> for<00:00:59.930> pumpkin<00:01:00.410> plus<00:01:00.620> it's<00:01:00.770> glittery<00:01:01.130> so

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
color for pumpkin plus it's glittery so

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.359 
color for pumpkin plus it's glittery so
