00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
forum 1.74 and yeah until that and we

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.660 
forum 1.74 and yeah until that and we
might<00:03:38.630> hold<00:03:38.870> off<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.470> but<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:40.160> think<00:03:40.550> it

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
might hold off with that but I think it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.430 
might hold off with that but I think it
would<00:03:40.790> be<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.420> would<00:03:41.540> be<00:03:41.660> able<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.900> publish<00:03:42.140> it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
would be you would be able to publish it

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.110 
would be you would be able to publish it
so<00:03:42.470> guys<00:03:42.830> can<00:03:43.040> use<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.250> as<00:03:43.459> well<00:03:43.489> right

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
so guys can use it as well right

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.729 
so guys can use it as well right
in<00:03:45.080> theory<00:03:45.430> mm-hmm<00:03:46.489> when<00:03:46.670> we<00:03:46.940> get<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:48.260> um<00:03:48.380> CPU

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
in theory mm-hmm when we get in um CPU

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.910 
in theory mm-hmm when we get in um CPU
release<00:03:48.950> why<00:03:49.489> not<00:03:49.670> yeah<00:03:50.180> um<00:03:50.810> tell<00:03:51.560> us<00:03:51.680> if<00:03:51.800> you

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
release why not yeah um tell us if you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.979 
release why not yeah um tell us if you
like<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:52.940> wanna<00:03:53.150> if<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.630> should<00:03:53.810> put

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
like this if you wanna if you should put

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.140 
like this if you wanna if you should put
some<00:03:54.170> more<00:03:54.350> work<00:03:54.530> into<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.520> think<00:03:56.000> it's

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
some more work into that I think it's

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.540 
some more work into that I think it's
really<00:03:56.660> really<00:03:56.930> cool<00:03:57.170> looks<00:03:57.860> awesome<00:03:58.370> and

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
really really cool looks awesome and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.310 
really really cool looks awesome and
maybe<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.120> know<00:03:59.239> would<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.480> be<00:03:59.600> possible<00:04:00.080> and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
maybe you know would it be possible and

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.020 
maybe you know would it be possible and
so<00:04:00.650> other<00:04:00.890> people<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.459> what<00:04:01.850> you're

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
so other people can see what you're

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.710 
so other people can see what you're
holding<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.660> your<00:04:02.780> arms<00:04:03.170> would<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.280> be

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
holding in your arms would it be

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.050 
holding in your arms would it be
complicated<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.840> do<00:04:06.430> would<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.550> possible<00:04:08.000> but

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060
