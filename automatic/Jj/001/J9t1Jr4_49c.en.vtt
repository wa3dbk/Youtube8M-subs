00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
on it anyway it's a very strange product

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.240 
on it anyway it's a very strange product
because<00:00:25.340> it<00:00:26.240> works<00:00:27.760> really<00:00:28.760> really<00:00:28.940> well

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
because it works really really well

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.250 
because it works really really well
however<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:32.059> are<00:00:32.090> going<00:00:32.450> to<00:00:32.629> need<00:00:32.809> to<00:00:33.050> have

very smooth very normal to oily skin

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.270 
very smooth very normal to oily skin
because<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:38.690> will<00:00:38.809> catch<00:00:39.079> on<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.710> any<00:00:39.949> dry

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280

on<00:00:45.739> really<00:00:45.800> nice<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.940> only<00:00:46.969> thing<00:00:47.359> I<00:00:47.420> would

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
on really nice the only thing I would

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.630 
on really nice the only thing I would
say<00:00:47.989> about<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:49.039> odd<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:50.030> that

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
say about it that is odd is that

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.340 
say about it that is odd is that
foundations<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.730> tend<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.659> stick

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
foundations that tend to be in stick

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.939 
foundations that tend to be in stick
format<00:00:54.920> often<00:00:55.219> times<00:00:55.909> are<00:00:56.120> not<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.510> best

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
format often times are not the best

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.219 
format often times are not the best
foundations<00:00:57.949> for<00:00:58.909> people<00:00:59.359> with<00:00:59.479> really<00:00:59.690> oily

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
foundations for people with really oily

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.919 
foundations for people with really oily
skin<00:01:00.559> because<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.039> ingredients<00:01:01.639> in<00:01:01.789> them<00:01:02.179> can

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
skin because the ingredients in them can

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.410 
skin because the ingredients in them can
often<00:01:03.350> times<00:01:03.620> be<00:01:03.949> slightly<00:01:04.460> more<00:01:04.699> problematic

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
often times be slightly more problematic

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.830 
often times be slightly more problematic
than<00:01:05.449> saying<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.960> liquid<00:01:06.380> or<00:01:07.210> mineral<00:01:08.210> or<00:01:08.509> even

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
than saying a liquid or mineral or even

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.289 
than saying a liquid or mineral or even
a<00:01:08.930> cream<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.520> need<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.790> bear<00:01:10.939> that<00:01:11.119> in<00:01:11.270> mind

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
a cream so you need to bear that in mind

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.319 
a cream so you need to bear that in mind
but<00:01:11.960> otherwise<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:13.219> a<00:01:13.430> really<00:01:13.790> really<00:01:13.969> good

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
but otherwise it's a really really good

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.830 
but otherwise it's a really really good
foundation<00:01:14.960> for<00:01:14.990> oily<00:01:15.740> skin<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:17.479> just

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
foundation for oily skin and it just

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.870 
foundation for oily skin and it just
does<00:01:18.110> an<00:01:18.320> amazing<00:01:18.710> job<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.430> bizarrely<00:01:19.759> enough

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
does an amazing job and bizarrely enough

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.459 
does an amazing job and bizarrely enough
despite<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.509> fact<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:20.719> it's<00:01:20.899> quite<00:01:21.170> small

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
despite the fact that it's quite small

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.950 
despite the fact that it's quite small
it<00:01:21.920> lasts<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.399> really<00:01:22.430> long<00:01:22.759> time<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.750> face

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it lasts a really long time on the face

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.190 
it lasts a really long time on the face
it<00:01:24.439> will<00:01:24.680> give<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.369> matte<00:01:26.140> actually<00:01:27.140> it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
it will give you a matte actually it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.600 
it will give you a matte actually it
probably<00:01:27.469> gives<00:01:27.560> more<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:28.009> Demi<00:01:28.310> matte

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
probably gives more of a Demi matte

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.069 
probably gives more of a Demi matte
finish<00:01:28.909> but<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.180> gives<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.450> matte<00:01:29.689> finish<00:01:30.049> to

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
finish but it gives a matte finish to

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.020 
finish but it gives a matte finish to
your<00:01:30.259> skin<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.950> lot<00:01:31.189> of<00:01:31.310> people<00:01:31.610> wore<00:01:31.820> like

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
your skin that a lot of people wore like

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.420 
your skin that a lot of people wore like
I<00:01:32.270> think<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:33.049> gets<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.350> big<00:01:33.619> thumbs<00:01:33.950> up<00:01:34.130> it's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
I think it gets a big thumbs up it's

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.940 
I think it gets a big thumbs up it's
certainly<00:01:34.789> better<00:01:34.969> than<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.180> awful<00:01:35.950> dream

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
certainly better than the awful dream

certainly better than the awful dream
