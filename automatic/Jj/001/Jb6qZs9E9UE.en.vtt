this one is correct for this hole the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.330 
this one is correct for this hole the
setback<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.270> you<00:03:34.390> can<00:03:34.540> see<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.830> dead

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
setback as you can see that it's dead

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.910 
setback as you can see that it's dead
center<00:03:36.610> there<00:03:37.000> where<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.590> pins<00:03:38.590> are<00:03:38.740> going<00:03:38.830> to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
center there where the pins are going to

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.000 
center there where the pins are going to
go<00:03:39.040> through<00:03:39.310> if<00:03:40.300> it's<00:03:40.959> not<00:03:41.170> they<00:03:41.650> have<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.830> way

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
go through if it's not they have a way

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.500 
go through if it's not they have a way
to<00:03:42.040> adjust<00:03:42.580> them<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.910> I'll<00:03:43.000> show<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.180> the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
to adjust them and I'll show you the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.660 
to adjust them and I'll show you the
instructions<00:03:44.110> this<00:03:44.740> one<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.160> just<00:03:45.190> kind<00:03:45.610> of

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
instructions this one you just kind of

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.449 
instructions this one you just kind of
rotate<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.180> like<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.350> see<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.650> makes

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
rotate it like that and you see it makes

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.940 
rotate it like that and you see it makes
this<00:03:48.670> part<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.120> little<00:03:49.360> bit<00:03:49.480> longer<00:03:49.720> now<00:03:50.709> there

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
this part a little bit longer now there

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.670 
this part a little bit longer now there
is<00:03:51.070> usually<00:03:51.490> an<00:03:51.790> up<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.240> a<00:03:52.360> down<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
is usually an up and a down to the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.009 
is usually an up and a down to the
deadbolt<00:03:54.070> because<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.519> is<00:03:54.870> offset<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> little

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
deadbolt because this is offset a little

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.650 
deadbolt because this is offset a little
bit<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.980> look<00:03:57.160> for<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.489> up<00:03:57.700> sign<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.709> just

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
bit so look for the up sign and you just

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.150 
bit so look for the up sign and you just
slide<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.810> in<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.350> one's<00:04:02.590> going<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.830> require

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
slide it in this one's going to require

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.040 
slide it in this one's going to require
trimming<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.290> wood<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:06.700> fit<00:04:06.940> nicely<00:04:07.150> you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
trimming of the wood to fit nicely you

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.740 
trimming of the wood to fit nicely you
can<00:04:08.080> use<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:09.160> use<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> razor<00:04:09.640> knife<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:10.180> trim

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
can use a just use a razor knife to trim

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.910 
can use a just use a razor knife to trim
that<00:04:10.870> up<00:04:11.190> usually<00:04:12.190> they<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:12.640> slide<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:13.090> in

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.360 

okay<00:04:16.670> so<00:04:17.420> I<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:17.510> used<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.989> razor<00:04:18.140> knife<00:04:18.370> to

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
okay so I just used a razor knife to

a little bit here and there and most
people<00:04:34.580> have<00:04:34.700> razor<00:04:34.910> knives<00:04:35.180> they<00:04:35.480> don't<00:04:35.660> have

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and getting these screws in is a bit of

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.350 
and getting these screws in is a bit of
a<00:05:00.800> hassle<00:05:00.980> you<00:05:01.580> really<00:05:01.790> go<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.940> with<00:05:02.180> them

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
a hassle you really go to with them

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.530 
a hassle you really go to with them
around<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.690> bit<00:05:06.669> sometimes<00:05:07.669> if<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.180> don't<00:05:08.330> get

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
around a bit sometimes if you don't get

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.439 
around a bit sometimes if you don't get
this<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:09.500> it's<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:10.490> know<00:05:10.520> off-center<00:05:11.270> off

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
this if it's you know off-center off

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.350 
this if it's you know off-center off
this<00:05:12.080> is<00:05:12.229> up<00:05:12.380> or<00:05:12.590> down<00:05:12.620> too<00:05:13.040> much<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:14.000> will<00:05:14.120> bind

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
this is up or down too much it will bind

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.570 
this is up or down too much it will bind
what<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.660> opens<00:05:15.020> closes<00:05:15.290> so<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.770> loosen

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
what it opens closes so you just loosen

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.090 
what it opens closes so you just loosen
off<00:05:16.699> the<00:05:16.820> screws<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.090> bit<00:05:17.360> move<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:17.900> bit

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
off the screws a bit move it a bit

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.850 
off the screws a bit move it a bit
tighten<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.160> up<00:05:19.310> till<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.639> works<00:05:20.630> well<00:05:20.960> and

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
tighten it up till it works well and

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.930 
tighten it up till it works well and
then<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.810> then<00:05:23.810> that's<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.229> for<00:05:25.190> this<00:05:25.610> side<00:05:25.820> of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
then and then that's it for this side of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.969 
then and then that's it for this side of
your<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.600> other<00:05:26.750> side<00:05:27.020> that<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.260> may<00:05:27.560> want<00:05:27.800> to

going<00:06:20.750> to<00:06:20.870> go<00:06:20.990> in<00:06:21.169> and<00:06:21.349> you<00:06:21.889> want<00:06:22.099> that<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.729> be

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
going to go in and you want that to be

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.170 
going to go in and you want that to be
towards<00:06:24.110> where<00:06:24.320> where<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.889> most<00:06:25.099> wood<00:06:25.370> is<00:06:25.520> so

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
towards where where the most wood is so

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.290 
towards where where the most wood is so
that's<00:06:26.360> on<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:26.570> inside<00:06:27.020> of<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:27.590> door<00:06:27.740> frame

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
that's on the inside of the door frame

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.909 
that's on the inside of the door frame
I'm<00:06:29.300> just<00:06:29.539> going<00:06:29.660> to<00:06:29.720> drill<00:06:30.020> for<00:06:30.349> a<00:06:30.380> little

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
I'm just going to drill for a little

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.450 
I'm just going to drill for a little
tiny<00:06:31.099> pilot<00:06:31.460> hole<00:06:32.590> right<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:33.710> the<00:06:33.770> center<00:06:33.830> so<00:06:34.430> I

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
tiny pilot hole right in the center so I

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.900 
tiny pilot hole right in the center so I
can<00:06:34.760> make<00:06:35.660> sure<00:06:36.130> pretty<00:06:37.130> much<00:06:37.310> centered<00:06:37.729> on

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
can make sure pretty much centered on

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.040 
can make sure pretty much centered on
all<00:06:38.030> these<00:06:38.210> holes<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.979> instructions<00:06:40.870> for<00:06:41.870> the

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
all these holes the instructions for the

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.120 
all these holes the instructions for the
dead<00:06:42.590> bolt<00:06:42.740> kit<00:06:43.039> say<00:06:43.389> use<00:06:44.389> a<00:06:44.419> 1/8<00:06:44.810> inch<00:06:44.840> bit<00:06:45.830> so

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
dead bolt kit say use a 1/8 inch bit so

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.689 
dead bolt kit say use a 1/8 inch bit so
that's<00:06:46.280> what<00:06:46.400> I'm<00:06:46.490> going<00:06:46.610> to<00:06:46.700> use

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.170 

so<00:06:53.699> this<00:06:53.849> kit<00:06:54.060> comes<00:06:54.270> with<00:06:54.449> both<00:06:54.840> a<00:06:55.080> long<00:06:56.069> and<00:06:56.400> a

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
so this kit comes with both a long and a

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.629 
so this kit comes with both a long and a
shorter<00:06:58.219> screw<00:06:59.219> that'll<00:06:59.520> go<00:06:59.669> in<00:07:01.280> to<00:07:02.280> these<00:07:02.400> big

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
shorter screw that'll go in to these big

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.779 
shorter screw that'll go in to these big
holes<00:07:02.990> I'm<00:07:03.990> going<00:07:04.259> to<00:07:04.319> use<00:07:04.439> a<00:07:04.520> longer<00:07:05.520> one

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
holes I'm going to use a longer one

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.999 
holes I'm going to use a longer one
because<00:07:06.000> I<00:07:06.090> got<00:07:06.270> access<00:07:06.689> to<00:07:06.870> I<00:07:06.930> got<00:07:07.080> a<00:07:07.110> hammer

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
because I got access to I got a hammer

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.529 
because I got access to I got a hammer
drill<00:07:08.310> if<00:07:08.789> you<00:07:08.969> don't<00:07:09.150> have<00:07:09.300> a<00:07:09.330> hammer

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
drill if you don't have a hammer

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:10.879 
drill if you don't have a hammer
drilling<00:07:09.930> you're<00:07:10.020> screwing<00:07:10.349> them<00:07:10.439> in<00:07:10.530> by<00:07:10.650> hand

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
drilling you're screwing them in by hand

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.950 
drilling you're screwing them in by hand
you<00:07:11.580> probably<00:07:11.909> might<00:07:12.210> have<00:07:12.389> to<00:07:12.539> go<00:07:12.659> for<00:07:12.870> the

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
you probably might have to go for the

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.510 
you probably might have to go for the
short<00:07:13.199> one<00:07:13.379> because<00:07:13.770> it<00:07:13.919> just<00:07:14.159> takes<00:07:14.430> you

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
short one because it just takes you

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.909 
short one because it just takes you
forever<00:07:14.699> to<00:07:15.000> to<00:07:15.840> screw<00:07:16.080> them<00:07:16.229> in<00:07:16.349> by<00:07:16.500> hand<00:07:16.530> with

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
forever to to screw them in by hand with

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:30.550 
forever to to screw them in by hand with
a<00:07:16.949> regular<00:07:17.280> screwdriver

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.760

and that's it a new deadbolt in place I

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.560 
and that's it a new deadbolt in place I
