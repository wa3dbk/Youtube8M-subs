00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.070 

there's<00:00:05.700> two<00:00:05.940> kinds<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.420> narrative<00:00:06.899> in

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
there's two kinds of narrative in

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.020 
there's two kinds of narrative in
architecture<00:00:07.740> there's<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.309> literal

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
architecture there's the literal

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.259 
architecture there's the literal
narrative<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.500> formal<00:00:11.130> narrative<00:00:11.639> the

narrative and a formal narrative the
literal<00:00:12.599> narrative<00:00:13.019> would<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.799> kind<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
literal narrative would be a kind of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.269 
literal narrative would be a kind of
architecture<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:16.199> Gothic<00:00:16.619> style<00:00:16.770> where

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
architecture like the Gothic style where

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.609 
architecture like the Gothic style where
you<00:00:17.460> had<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.760> story<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> Bible<00:00:18.720> presented

you had the story of the Bible presented

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.790 
you had the story of the Bible presented
through<00:00:20.250> iconography<00:00:21.180> at<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.260> portals

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
through iconography at the portals

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.370 
through iconography at the portals
through<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> stained<00:00:23.640> glass<00:00:24.230> through<00:00:25.230> the

the<00:00:29.519> other<00:00:29.699> kind<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.570> formal<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.439> call<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the other kind the formal what we call a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060 
the other kind the formal what we call a
formal<00:00:32.880> narrative<00:00:33.450> has<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
formal narrative has to do with what the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.610 
formal narrative has to do with what the
shape<00:00:35.340> says<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.899> project<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.559> this

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
shape says to you in a project like this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
shape says to you in a project like this
we<00:00:38.219> wanted<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> use<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.050> narrative

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we wanted to use a kind of narrative

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
we wanted to use a kind of narrative
that<00:00:40.860> infused<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> meaning<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
that infused it with the meaning that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.720 
that infused it with the meaning that
meant<00:00:43.230> something<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> patrons<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
meant something to the patrons of this

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.959 
meant something to the patrons of this
home<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.450> patron<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.469> Catholic<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.940> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
home the patron is Catholic and so I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.910 
home the patron is Catholic and so I
wanted<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> say<00:00:48.840> something<00:00:49.289> about<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> nature

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
also use a language of architecture that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.310 
also use a language of architecture that
spoke<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.640> nature<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.049> Catholicism<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> a

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
right there in the front yard if you

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.850 
right there in the front yard if you
will<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.950> Vatican<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:34.660> house<00:04:34.960> being<00:04:35.590> of

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
that period I wanted to have a dialogue

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.740 
that period I wanted to have a dialogue
between<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.490> circle<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.420> ellipse

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
between the circle and the ellipse

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.990 
between the circle and the ellipse
because<00:04:41.290> there<00:04:41.500> was<00:04:41.650> an<00:04:41.860> important<00:04:42.640> change

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
because there was an important change

you so in so many ways throughout the
project<00:05:34.930> we<00:05:35.770> are<00:05:35.800> setting<00:05:36.580> up<00:05:36.700> a<00:05:36.880> dialogue

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
project we are setting up a dialogue

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.290 
project we are setting up a dialogue
between<00:05:37.720> those<00:05:38.140> two<00:05:38.410> things<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.730> when<00:05:39.910> we<00:05:40.060> use

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
between those two things so when we use

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.270 
between those two things so when we use
the<00:05:40.330> narrative<00:05:41.050> and<00:05:41.230> architecture<00:05:41.950> and<00:05:42.100> we're

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
the narrative and architecture and we're

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.270 
the narrative and architecture and we're
doing<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.810> period<00:05:43.810> home<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.620> we<00:05:44.860> want<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.160> make

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
doing a period home and we want to make

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.090 
doing a period home and we want to make
reference<00:05:45.850> to<00:05:45.970> things<00:05:46.570> historically<00:05:46.890> we<00:05:47.890> also

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
reference to things historically we also

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.970
