00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello dear friends with you the basics 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.460
 maximova 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hello everyone and today will be a review on 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.929
 my creative student is naked these seven on 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.680
 50 so we can see in this situation is the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.820
 there is one position for these headphones 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.670
 so not only is it not a pity for me too 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 like it here we see the inscription creative 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 we have so soft panels 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 pad so we were looking for a reason 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.980
 services after about using they 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 very durable because i'm already filed 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 they are very good sound insulation then 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 there is this if you hear music then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 no one will be heard 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.289
 and if you just sit there 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 nothing will of course you will live and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.110
 when the voices are ambient and all sounds 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.160
 so then I like what else I have 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.410
 I liked the fact that here it is traveling 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.660
 headphones move very far because 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.520
 what are you good for big heads that is 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.490
 take me awkward nothing and you will 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.990
 stand small in general I like 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 microphone is the code here is the input for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.520
 microphone 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.210
 but I really don't like it because 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.440
 good but right from the base because ragnu 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.190
 we haven't broken nc 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.660
 that is, I love to eat for everything 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.990
 computer and when you eat everything 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.280
 food is just something drooling fly microphone then 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 it is not very convenient 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.710
 gods for me in these headphones wire 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:51.090
 one and a half meters by the way they are not 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.770
 adapter for the phone here are these moves 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.770
 they are three and a half centimeters 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 young so so here is such a thing 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.369
 creative designing now i seem sound 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.869
 and the boat thing I do not know what it is and to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.490
 to strengthen hope is the shirt or 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.310
 T-shirt itself kept on clear 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.040
 next, let's look at the box like that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.150
 fast box here we are poor and sandra 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.900
 Creative class fight here we see 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.230
 microphone as they add up and this one 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.670
 thing where you yourself headphones show that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.770
 this one this what this on stage this still 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.349
 Russians still spreading their arms and tapir 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.050
 more dangerous neodymium speakers allow 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.780
 very dropped infertility of the enemy 2 us 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.599
 mic is a terrific mic for 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.340
 headphone and the third is the surface of the moon 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.390
 and liner fold and convenience 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.920
 storage can me they hang 224 like 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.260
 gigov drama rome you fell and millimeter 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.739
 headphone input 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.580
 but for an NBA player, it's hard, like everything 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.910
 all while you were Vlad good luck 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.430
