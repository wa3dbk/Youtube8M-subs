00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.340
 it was a very complicated dialogue I have 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.060
 to concentrate a lot because it says so 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.060
 one 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.920
 very fun to record albums you have to 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.440
 record 20 differently is a 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.380
 great experience to be able to make guides already in 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.270
 the third installment of the saga very 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.340
 happy for the reception he has had 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.070
 of the general public 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.060
 as you know is the first game 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.860
 that marked soft decides to record to double in 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.540
 the Spanish of others that we give them 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.579
 us that our modalities of 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.220
 talk here before you remember that it was 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.590
 horrible 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.960
 I'm going to shoot you I had the opportunity 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.980
 to be in Spain when we recorded in the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.149
 number 2 will know the sea â€‹â€‹that you from 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.449
 Spain also a very nice experience 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.989
 it's not so easy to really record 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.469
 video game 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.400
 I am an actor an announcer and actor of 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.400
 dubbing that I come 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.400
 cartoon movies and so on 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.220
 etc 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.830
 really the world of video games has 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.690
 It was incredible if you face windows that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.400
 people can see tomorrow 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.830
 let there be the growth of vast 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.940
 sharing with you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.940
 being the whole program 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:39.800
 as a zone but 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.800
 another world together at 3 11 23 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 I think it must be cold for something 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.070
 1 2 and 3 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.130
 Too low 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.870
 the truth 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.970
 but good 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.490

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.090
 Charming prince 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 the lion of madagascar 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.489
 Gollum so on and so companions 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.769
 of a lot of quality that I think the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.069
 public like a tea to be so warm and 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.480

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.400

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.549

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.549

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.610

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.610

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.819

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.840
 all the characters we have 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.380
 we are going to configure that the entities 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.880
 they need 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.470
 with a loss 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.250
 or what a laborious lumps said 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.400
 of sandwiches as you are so down 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.110

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.110
 politicians not with me 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.920
 I tell you that with these matches 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.640
 because we have games 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.640

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.959
 the change from isabel 18 who just wants 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.959
 let go of love 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.569
 here I have a couple of the group 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.569
 because the arms 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.470
