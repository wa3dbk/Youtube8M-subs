okay<00:00:00.570> you're<00:00:00.780> on<00:00:00.900> okay<00:00:02.580> what's<00:00:03.030> happened<00:00:03.389> this

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay you're on okay what's happened this

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.150 
okay you're on okay what's happened this
is<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.720> fourth<00:00:03.959> day<00:00:04.170> with<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.470> fermentation

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
is the fourth day with the fermentation

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.909 
is the fourth day with the fermentation
and<00:00:05.480> as<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.629> can<00:00:06.750> see<00:00:07.020> over<00:00:07.259> here<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.710> don't

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
and as you can see over here I don't

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.140 
and as you can see over here I don't
know<00:00:07.980> if<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.280> see<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.550> or<00:00:08.639> not<00:00:08.760> but<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
know if you can see it or not but the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.290 
know if you can see it or not but the
the<00:00:10.080> carbon<00:00:10.860> dioxide<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.580> that's<00:00:12.120> being

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
the carbon dioxide is that's being

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.169 
the carbon dioxide is that's being
produced<00:00:12.509> by<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.900> yeast<00:00:13.320> that's<00:00:13.559> pushing<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
produced by the yeast that's pushing the

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.420 
produced by the yeast that's pushing the
the<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.960> grapes<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.590> skins<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> seeds

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the the grapes the skins and the seeds

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.870 
the the grapes the skins and the seeds
all<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:19.050> preventing<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.520> carbon

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
all up so it's preventing the carbon

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.140 
all up so it's preventing the carbon
dioxide<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.630> from<00:00:22.619> exiting<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> it's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
dioxide from from exiting and it's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.439 
dioxide from from exiting and it's
preventing<00:00:24.660> oxygen<00:00:25.140> from<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.560> back<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
preventing oxygen from going back in and

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.450 
preventing oxygen from going back in and
and<00:00:27.710> nourishing<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> east<00:00:29.010> oak<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and nourishing the east oak and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.350 
and nourishing the east oak and
multiplying<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.550> push<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:33.090> here

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
multiplying so when I push down on here

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.410 
multiplying so when I push down on here
you'll<00:00:34.320> you'll<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.250> come<00:00:35.489> closer<00:00:35.700> you'll

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
you'll you'll see it come closer you'll

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.500 
you'll you'll see it come closer you'll
see<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> foam<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> bubbles

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
see all the all the foam and bubbles

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
see all the all the foam and bubbles
come<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.620> pretty<00:00:40.829> neat<00:00:41.190> it's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
come out of here it's pretty neat it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.040 
come out of here it's pretty neat it's
like<00:00:41.660> kind<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> waterfall<00:00:43.170> you

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
like kind of like a waterfall you

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.470 
like kind of like a waterfall you
actually<00:00:46.050> hear<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.319 

you<00:00:50.260> see<00:00:50.469> all<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.760> coming<00:00:51.760> up<00:00:51.910> see<00:00:52.120> all<00:00:52.210> those

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
you see all that coming up see all those

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.000 
you see all that coming up see all those
bubble<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.690> carbon<00:00:52.929> dioxide<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.530> just<00:00:53.710> coming

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
bubble of carbon dioxide is just coming

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.069 
bubble of carbon dioxide is just coming
out<00:00:56.339> so<00:00:57.339> if<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.550> take<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.390> took<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.719> taste<00:00:58.899> of

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
out so if you take the took a taste of

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.380 
out so if you take the took a taste of
this<00:00:59.199> right<00:00:59.379> now<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.800> tastes<00:01:00.129> very<00:01:00.579> much<00:01:00.879> like

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
this right now it tastes very much like

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.880 
this right now it tastes very much like
yeast<00:01:01.899> but<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.229> would<00:01:02.320> taste<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.739> lot<00:01:02.829> like

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
yeast but it would taste a lot like

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.820 
yeast but it would taste a lot like
carbon<00:01:03.579> dioxide<00:01:04.019> almost<00:01:05.019> like<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> soda<00:01:05.530> look

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
carbon dioxide almost like a soda look

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.300 
carbon dioxide almost like a soda look
at<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.070> Wow<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.600> like<00:01:07.780> it's<00:01:08.049> we<00:01:08.530> just<00:01:08.560> stuck

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
at that Wow it's like it's we just stuck

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.100 
at that Wow it's like it's we just stuck
an<00:01:09.460> animal<00:01:09.789> it's<00:01:09.909> bleeding

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.790 

so<00:01:14.830> this<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> something<00:01:16.300> we<00:01:16.510> do<00:01:16.710> two<00:01:17.710> or

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
so this is a something we do two or

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.520 
so this is a something we do two or
three<00:01:17.830> times<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.310> day<00:01:18.480> and<00:01:19.480> this<00:01:19.600> lasts<00:01:20.200> for

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
three times a day and this lasts for

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.300 
three times a day and this lasts for
about<00:01:20.970> anywhere<00:01:21.970> from<00:01:22.360> five<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.960> seven<00:01:23.310> ten

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
about anywhere from five to seven ten

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.650 
about anywhere from five to seven ten
could<00:01:24.640> even<00:01:24.790> be<00:01:24.970> up<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.210> 15<00:01:25.570> days<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:27.540> until<00:01:28.540> it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
could even be up to 15 days and until it

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.810 
could even be up to 15 days and until it
stops<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:30.010> fermentation<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.630> then<00:01:31.900> we<00:01:32.140> will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
stops the fermentation and then we will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.640 
stops the fermentation and then we will
press<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.760> grape<00:01:36.760> skin<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:38.170> get<00:01:38.290> all<00:01:38.470> of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
press the the grape skin to get all of

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.050 
press the the grape skin to get all of
the<00:01:38.770> juice<00:01:39.010> out<00:01:39.190> of<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.610> then<00:01:39.730> we'll<00:01:39.910> put

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
the juice out of it and then we'll put

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.220 
the juice out of it and then we'll put
it<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.390> oak<00:01:41.230> barrel<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.920> let<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:42.900> let<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:43.960> sit

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
it in a oak barrel and let it let it sit

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.820 
it in a oak barrel and let it let it sit
for<00:01:44.260> about<00:01:44.500> 30<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.190> 45<00:01:45.610> days<00:01:45.640> an<00:01:46.060> animal<00:01:46.360> I

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
for about 30 to 45 days an animal I

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.670 
for about 30 to 45 days an animal I
would<00:01:47.830> remove<00:01:48.460> any<00:01:48.780> sludge<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.140> settles<00:01:50.620> to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
would remove any sludge that settles to

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.880 
would remove any sludge that settles to
the<00:01:50.800> bottom<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:52.120> we'll<00:01:52.690> put<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.470> back<00:01:53.620> in<00:01:53.800> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the bottom and we'll put it back in the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.390 
the bottom and we'll put it back in the
barrel<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.360> it's<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.570> simple<00:01:56.400> nature

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
barrel so it's pretty simple nature

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.660 
barrel so it's pretty simple nature

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
makes the wine I don't add any yeast I

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.820 
makes the wine I don't add any yeast I
don't<00:02:01.420> have<00:02:01.570> any<00:02:01.750> sugar<00:02:02.050> or<00:02:03.180> any<00:02:04.619> any<00:02:05.619> any
