00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

obviously our shorter hair than you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.999 
obviously our shorter hair than you
because<00:01:21.930> i<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> extensions<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
because i don't have the extensions in
or<00:01:23.130> anything<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.640> um<00:01:24.479> cuz<00:01:25.020> i<00:01:25.080> don't<00:01:25.229> own

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
any but this is what I turned out like

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.560 
any but this is what I turned out like
and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.409> ideal<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:30.329> worked

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and I know it's not ideal but it worked

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.410 
and I know it's not ideal but it worked
and<00:01:31.340> like<00:01:32.340> singing<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> ball<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:34.159> like

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
and like singing with the ball and like

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
and like singing with the ball and like
this<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.990> feather<00:01:37.290> thing<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this the feather thing this is what I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.890 
this the feather thing this is what I
may<00:01:38.310> need<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.180> part<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.720> hair

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
may need I know this part like my hair

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
may need I know this part like my hair
is<00:01:39.990> probably<00:01:40.140> considerably<00:01:40.829> less<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.700> yours

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
is probably considerably less than yours

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
is probably considerably less than yours
so<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.439> flimsy<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.430> figure

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so it's a little flimsy but i can figure

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.030 
so it's a little flimsy but i can figure
that<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:45.720> tries<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.380> trials<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that out with more tries like trials and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.580 
that out with more tries like trials and
stuff<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.930> don't<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.290> hear<00:01:49.439> any

stuff I don't know if you could hear any

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.870 
stuff I don't know if you could hear any
of<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> since<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> wasn't<00:01:50.280> chasing<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> camera

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
of it since I wasn't chasing the camera
