00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello, how are you? , thanks for being in Distribution and Consumption

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.859
Our guest today Sebriano Eduardo, BSc in Chemistry (UBA)

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:13.349
but He is specialized in sensory marketing. How are you Eduardo?

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.249
Eduardo was already in the program and were talking

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.810
so we go directly to a question that really interests me

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.109
At a time where things are not very clear to say in our market.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.349
high and low

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.519
in relation to consumption

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.020
The companies, are looking for new products with new flavors?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.339
Yes, especially in food and beverages

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.960
Our projections are that the market will be growth this year

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.680
The innovation is so important. Some times when you have growth

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.900
double digits, then it is not necessary to make many changes

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.680
but when the growth is going to be what it is in all countries 2 or 3 %

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.860
is necessary to innovate and flavors, fragrances are an important part

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.300
either because they got new products with new flavors, there were many innovations

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.710
in many of the beverages companies

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.119
were making new lemon drinks, "Limonetto", "Lemonchelo", "Naranchelo"

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.530
all that kind of products

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.620
and we are also seeing that there is a sort of

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.000
development, of what is the famous "umbrella flavors" of Argentina

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.690
in terms of new proposals, for example you have now

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.780
some drinks with flavors of pear, grape .. they were released

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.020
in recent times, we did a study of trends

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.520
a major company, that "the flavors of tomorrow" was called

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.380
one of the characteristics of Argentine consumer

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.570
, People "from the south,"

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.479
we like the citrics fruits, because are fruits develop low

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.380
photosynthesis and the low sugar levels,  we have some limits to incorporate new flavors but

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.160
Now little by little it is modified and also you have much

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.170
response which are dairy, cheeses, such was not only

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.800
flavors but also proposals, a company (SANCOR) was taking for example

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.610
the concept "center or heart of cheese", a great idea

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.580
always wears one question: why not sell watermelon only

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.510
Centre, becausse is the most tasted part...

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.319
I always want to eat the center property - clear

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.530
here you have such an excellent

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.139
idea

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:13.959
and also

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.170
many brands for established brands for which we are working

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.239
say, we have the leading brand, but really is the richest, if the game tries to blind?

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.929
Is it that everyone prefers?

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.439
and that's important, because just lets you have the best product in the

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.789
best brand, which is the most you will be supporting and profitability going to be able

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.789
developed in the future. So yeah. There is much development in terms

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.939
flavors and new products. - What you're saying is

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.879
give added value to the "Mark"

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.659
With new products, new formats and so on. -If obviously

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.790
A brand is number one if or if having the richest product.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.370
But what happens is that:

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.850
if you got the richest product, even if you have a great Brand

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.120
Precisely how people will be trying other things and comparing prices

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.470
will say: "Hey, this brand is cheaper and the product is pretty good ..."

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.250
respect to its taste and how it works

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.119
and then you start to have lost market

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.419
- What are the channels looking for more innovation in flavors ...

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.629
Including proposals ...? - Sales Channels or categories?

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.669
- Categories

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.189
- Fundamentally foods and beverages, you know that Argentina is a great

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.980
food producer

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.689
and actually is still below what would be ...

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.700
we calculate a coefficient that has to do with the

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.459
amount of SKU's, the number of different types

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.560
products in relationships with the country population

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.180
and the coefficient in Argentina, is still low. What do you mean?

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.790
That actually, oddly enough ...

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.110
compared to other countries, when you go to a point you sell, you do not have many

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.719
proposals

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.689
and then

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.460
all that is food and drink. cookies, bread, milk,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.060
all you have to do with frozen, which are fully developed

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.810
there were some important developments

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.660
For instance,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.140
"Ready" chicken ("Listos de pollo" ) are prepared directly

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.710
you put in a toaster and "out" There will be a whole development in Argentina

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.319
very important that has to do with "healthy snacks"

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.400
that is, that you can give your child something

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.800
you can carry in your backpack (school), for when they are playing in the park

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.989
but always this product will be tasted and preferenced ... - Fruits dissected for example?

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.389
And combinations, some may be salty. Imagine chicken balls

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.060
with cheese, and vegetables and come prepared ... The industry has to give

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.999
the possibility that if you have something that makes you what you had "cost" rather

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.459
and you have to ensure quality for a kid to eat vegetables

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:39.270
combined with cheese and chicken but that is tasted

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.860
- Argentina is an avid consumer of this type of news?

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.520
- Depending on the category,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.229
Argentine consumer is very hungry to such developments

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.419
There are categories

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.790
eg whatever it treats

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.900
roughly 30% of the sale involves "new" products

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.200
anyone selling ice cream knows that 25% of its sales

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.980
will come from the new innovations that you can get that year

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.419
- If you see someone in a kiosk

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.740
if you have to buy cigarettes, go and ask the brand out there has really

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.990
and no account is given (planned purchase)

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.860
and when to buy a treat (impulse buy), the person is

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.660
10 pesos, looking as if to make an investment in the bag

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.090
- Exastamente, looking and looking ... - This is the typical "search news"

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.089
Why, especially sweets, what you want is to give you the "pleasure cuotita you out of your routine" (Insight)

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.500
and there are great challenges, for example Argentina has still pending

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.469
challenge that Argentina has a Mark to give you the Chocolate which is

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.810
"The epitome of chocolate in your mouth" (Brand Promise), "Terrible"

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.770
Argentina, though it may seem, is still in many categories

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.020
"Excellence" to develop products or premium products

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.419
that you say, for example YES! tomÃ¡ this coffee is the richest ....

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.569
There were a lot of development ...

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.860
massive, new flavors, but

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.439
there is still much room for improvement in terms of experience

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:58.259
that gives consumers

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.449
- How nice. We can not deny that it is a note of good taste

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.439
'Thank you, thank you very much for being with us

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.419
Thank you very much, when we will want around here.

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.589
We will convene again, Eduardo Sebriano
