that runs on the computer that helps

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
that runs on the computer that helps
keep<00:01:21.630> all<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.900> windows<00:01:22.200> arranged<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.040> it

keep all of your windows arranged and it
can<00:01:23.400> also<00:01:23.520> handle<00:01:23.759> things<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.150> security<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
can also handle things like security so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.890 
can also handle things like security so
you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.080> lock<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.650> dock<00:01:25.860> into<00:01:26.159> place<00:01:26.720> via<00:01:27.720> the

with a key or a combination lock you can

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429 
with a key or a combination lock you can
actually<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.600> through<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> software

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
actually do it all through the software

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.749 
actually do it all through the software
so<00:01:58.680> from<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> user<00:01:59.130> perspective<00:01:59.280> it's

disused Apple accessories so we

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.290 
disused Apple accessories so we
implemented<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.610> program<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.090> two<00:03:03.180> different

implemented one program in two different

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.610 
implemented one program in two different
parts<00:03:03.660> called<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.960> life<00:03:04.110> after<00:03:04.260> device

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
parts called the life after device

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.430 
parts called the life after device
program<00:03:05.460> for<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> gravitas<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.840> means<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
program for the gravitas that means that

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920 
program for the gravitas that means that
when<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.890> new<00:03:08.280> device<00:03:08.850> rolls<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.360> from<00:03:09.570> Apple

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
when a new device rolls out from Apple

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
if you own a gravitas you'll be able to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.920 
if you own a gravitas you'll be able to
just<00:03:11.670> upgrade<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.240> insert<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.570> goes<00:03:12.750> into

just upgrade the insert that goes into

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.020 
just upgrade the insert that goes into
the<00:03:13.050> dock<00:03:13.230> rather<00:03:13.980> than<00:03:14.100> having<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.610> buy<00:03:15.000> a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the dock rather than having to buy a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.050 
the dock rather than having to buy a
whole<00:03:15.240> new<00:03:15.270> unit<00:03:15.630> for<00:03:16.080> our<00:03:16.410> form<00:03:16.740> fitting

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
whole new unit for our form fitting

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.130 
whole new unit for our form fitting
devices<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.240> our<00:03:18.420> vertical<00:03:18.660> docks<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.110> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
devices like our vertical docks in the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.210 
devices like our vertical docks in the
horizontal<00:03:19.380> dock<00:03:19.680> here

horizontal dock here
life<00:03:20.670> after<00:03:20.850> device<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:22.260> basically<00:03:22.710> a

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
life after device is basically a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.170 
life after device is basically a
replacement<00:03:23.310> program<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.760> instead<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.060> having

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
replacement program so instead of having

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.540 
replacement program so instead of having
to<00:03:24.300> buy<00:03:24.510> into<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.040> whole<00:03:26.040> new<00:03:26.220> docking

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
to buy into the whole new docking

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.820 
to buy into the whole new docking
station<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.840> purchase<00:03:28.230> will<00:03:28.560> give<00:03:28.800> a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
station that purchase will give a

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.470 
station that purchase will give a
discount<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.400> between<00:03:29.820> 30<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.060> 40<00:03:30.360> percent

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
