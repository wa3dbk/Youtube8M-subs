have done like if if they did still have

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.289 
have done like if if they did still have
Kaimuki<00:02:44.730> hostage

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
Kaimuki hostage

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.360 
Kaimuki hostage
what<00:02:45.720> did<00:02:45.810> she<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:46.079> all<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.560> way<00:02:46.799> for<00:02:46.829> if<00:02:47.340> she

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
what did she go all that way for if she

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.629 
what did she go all that way for if she
knew<00:02:47.819> kite<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.299> already<00:02:48.810> did<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:50.189> again<00:02:50.459> she

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
knew kite was already did from again she

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.920 
knew kite was already did from again she
took<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.879> man's<00:02:51.060> head<00:02:51.209> off<00:02:51.359> if<00:02:51.659> she<00:02:51.810> knew

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
took the man's head off if she knew

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.270 
took the man's head off if she knew
there<00:02:52.049> was<00:02:52.169> no<00:02:52.379> going<00:02:52.409> back<00:02:52.889> from<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.159> why

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
there was no going back from that why

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.580 
there was no going back from that why
would<00:02:53.400> she<00:02:53.519> put<00:02:53.669> this<00:02:53.879> rule<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.419> long<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:55.019> guess

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
would she put this rule so long I guess

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.399 
would she put this rule so long I guess
to<00:02:56.250> maybe<00:02:56.700> lead<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.510> lead<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> boy<00:02:58.139> into<00:02:58.319> a

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
to maybe lead to lead the boy into a

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.589 
to maybe lead to lead the boy into a
processes<00:02:59.010> lead<00:02:59.609> to<00:02:59.639> lead<00:02:59.970> him<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.329> trap

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
processes lead to lead him to that trap

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.360 
processes lead to lead him to that trap
emotional<00:03:01.530> trap<00:03:01.769> okay<00:03:01.919> give<00:03:02.220> him<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
emotional trap okay give him the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.129 
emotional trap okay give him the
breakdown<00:03:02.790> give<00:03:03.239> him<00:03:03.329> take<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.599> his<00:03:03.689> guard

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
breakdown give him take up his guard

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.720 
breakdown give him take up his guard
but<00:03:04.470> then<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.769> raises<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.189> other<00:03:05.310> question

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
but then that raises the other question

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.849 
but then that raises the other question
why<00:03:05.879> hasn't<00:03:06.329> she<00:03:06.359> had<00:03:06.510> attack<00:03:07.139> gone<00:03:07.379> yet<00:03:07.590> okay

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
why hasn't she had attack gone yet okay

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.349 
why hasn't she had attack gone yet okay
I'm<00:03:08.010> pretty<00:03:08.159> sure<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.700> wide<00:03:08.939> open

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
I'm pretty sure going is wide open

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.659 
I'm pretty sure going is wide open
can<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.930> easily<00:03:10.620> receive<00:03:11.129> some<00:03:11.310> damage<00:03:11.639> from

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
can we easily receive some damage from

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.190 
can we easily receive some damage from
one<00:03:11.909> effort<00:03:12.329> because<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.629> blows<00:03:12.810> right<00:03:12.989> now

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
one effort because it blows right now

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.599 
one effort because it blows right now
and<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:14.569> just<00:03:15.569> don't<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:16.250> what<00:03:17.250> she's<00:03:17.280> doing

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
and I just don't know what she's doing

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.159 
and I just don't know what she's doing
or<00:03:17.849> what's<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.090> plan<00:03:18.329> maybe<00:03:18.569> she<00:03:18.780> lied<00:03:18.959> too

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
or what's the plan maybe she lied too

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.750 
or what's the plan maybe she lied too
maybe<00:03:19.409> she<00:03:19.590> actually<00:03:19.680> can't<00:03:20.069> bring<00:03:20.280> kite<00:03:20.519> back

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
maybe she actually can't bring kite back

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.469 
maybe she actually can't bring kite back
and<00:03:22.159> she's<00:03:23.159> just<00:03:23.310> doing<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.699> because<00:03:23.849> she<00:03:24.180> no

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
and she's just doing this because she no

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.360 
and she's just doing this because she no
no<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.780> has<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.319> because<00:03:25.709> she's<00:03:25.919> no<00:03:26.069> longer

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
