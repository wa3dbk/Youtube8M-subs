00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
started it up the issue here is that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.480 
started it up the issue here is that
when<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.770> start<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:21.080> such<00:00:22.250> you'll<00:00:23.250> have

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
when you start it up as such you'll have

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.240 
when you start it up as such you'll have
a<00:00:23.730> list<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.840> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.199> aspect<00:00:25.560> ratio<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
a list this kind of aspect ratio and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 
a list this kind of aspect ratio and
it's<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.330> good<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:28.109> good<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.500> it's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it's not good not good actually it's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.349 
it's not good not good actually it's
very<00:00:29.160> annoying<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.699> me<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
very annoying for me because I have to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
very annoying for me because I have to
actually<00:00:30.900> stretch<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.439> stretch<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
actually stretch out stretch it out to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.510 
actually stretch out stretch it out to
hit<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.180> ratio<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:35.219> gets<00:00:35.430> very

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
hit the right ratio and it gets very

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.950 
hit the right ratio and it gets very
blurry<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.140> editing<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.860> video<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
blurry when I'm editing a video and it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
blurry when I'm editing a video and it
makes<00:00:40.140> me<00:00:40.379> lose<00:00:40.590> interest<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.370> actually

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
makes me lose interest in actually

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880 
makes me lose interest in actually
making<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.629> video<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.559> clear

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
making a video because it's not as clear

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
making a video because it's not as clear
as<00:00:43.980> making<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.480> PlayStation<00:00:45.480> 4<00:00:45.750> video<00:00:46.050> or

exit to the system menu and yeah the

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.020 
exit to the system menu and yeah the
reason<00:04:30.440> why<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.889> had<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.070> 16-point<00:04:31.550> 9

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
reason why that you had a 16-point 9

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.990 
reason why that you had a 16-point 9
aspect<00:04:32.210> ratio<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:33.289> that<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:34.010> because<00:04:34.370> that<00:04:34.910> you

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
aspect ratio on that is because that you

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.290 
aspect ratio on that is because that you
had<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.840> loaded<00:04:36.200> up<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:37.160> game<00:04:37.520> homebrew

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
the blue one that you see right now that

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.629
