00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.069
 iolo de whats going on drink here i have 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.330
 For some time no tutorials 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.630
 that's why i thought i'd come 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 is time again and I take myself 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.990
 just a little bit today it's about how you 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.789
 ever programs so tools at all 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.900
 connects with the console and that one 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.010
 can also use 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.470
 First of all, you have to xbox 360 naked 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 I also install this as a tutor 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.070
 He also learned how to install it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.910
 Look at this before if you can 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.210
 you do not have if yes everything is good 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.460
 Also important is your console 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
 as a dev kit then so if you 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.920
 notebook installed, and your console 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 I'll leave it for a moment 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 then you call but where you have here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 James Clapper first of the Vortex 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 boxplay 6d development you're wrong there 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.890
 yes tick and then ready 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.030
 put so then you have your jay here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 tech or rather yes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.479
 then you click on retail hard drive in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.490
 Clear 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 and then he probably has 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.920
 your deschler and charming installed 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.880
 have installed have I had a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.259
 lounge points 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.500
 they have you on the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.970
 desktop because since 1 6 767 the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.909
 sportversion it is not so necessary anymore 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.369
 actually the whole of the schlaun on 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.780
 to have finished 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.350
 just the lounge is enough for that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 Points 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 but if you have your console 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 updated with xe you want to know 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.329
 Make sure you attend the sessions 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.590
 settings include the launch clicks 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.320
 because only then does that work without it 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.990
 the germany boss 6 so now you have 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.280
 your lounge.de opens once and you 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.909
 look at me with plugins here plugins 1 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.420
 is empty 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.710
 plugins 3 is empty space five is empty 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.540
 Here I already have xp dm as 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.720
 plug-in and pc 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.970
 I'm just leading pcx here 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.610
 a memory to me so and then he goes 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.240
 back to the folder that twice 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.680
 openly so and then he writes about that 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.520
 just on your hard drive you see 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.410
 the size has changed 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.890
 and there you have the console a new one 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.420
 start 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.250
 So do it now and I want 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.880
 Now just that xbox live gold 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.310
 Use book tool is from one 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.220
 Colleagues of mine and someone else 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.760
 I do not know me until very shortly 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:03:02.550
 console commandments of because there just so 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:04.900
 a bit connected to the but is 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.640
 now will 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.370
 We are back with the console now 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.600
 connected when connected to us now 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.459
 ag active connection you have to join here 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.780
 Just let it on 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.700
 Click and then an exception for 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.709
 this program with you after firewall 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.120
 saved that also has the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.220
 Connection should be allowed here 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.019
 you see active connection and then 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.030
 you can each program the respective 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.620
 program the respective book that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.500
 program what content use 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.560
 wanted to use and then you can here 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.780
 Book golz or whatever and yes 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.610
 so contacts the halt the tools you have to 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.040
 just make sure you are rpc 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.500
 and xp dm as plugins so xp dm is 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.150
 for not heard and he pcs for the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.160
 whole tools there are also xrp 10.6 but 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.230
 rpc point xx is a newer version 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.200
 I would always use that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.230
 a description so you use the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.090
 tools you no longer need sleep 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.660
 do it all with the jump in the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.290
 said, pay attention to that when flashing 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.120
 you include the settings and in 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.510
 cluj landscape because otherwise 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.160
 does it work 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.760
 really if you do not score a lounge 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.530
 have the file and he needs one then 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.760
 can you also download my in 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.210
 the description is these files 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.419
 third here exactly on request 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.520
 is there also the xbox live software 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.660
 if we want to stop and stop that are 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.620
 also in the description the two 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.810
 files here and there is actually synonymous 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.949
 be back in the future 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.780
 probably also some tutorials 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.650
 but I do not promise to follow 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.570
 but I'm actually relative 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.520
 sure that some will come 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.430
 i hope this little over short 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.639
 fallen tutorial and until the next 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.639
 times
