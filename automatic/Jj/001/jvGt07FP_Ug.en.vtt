00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
people who just got these machines don't

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.160 
people who just got these machines don't
get<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.000> frustrated<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.629> them<00:00:06.899> right<00:00:07.049> away

get so frustrated with them right away
now<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:07.980> first<00:00:08.280> main<00:00:08.519> thing<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.059> keep<00:00:09.179> it

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
now the first main thing is to keep it

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.030 
now the first main thing is to keep it
on<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.780> whole<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.410> never<00:00:10.530> want<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> shut

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
on the whole time you never want to shut

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.379 
on the whole time you never want to shut
