00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
view and I did actually use this with my

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.590 
view and I did actually use this with my
envelope<00:05:56.240> punch<00:05:56.480> board<00:05:56.630> but<00:05:57.080> for<00:05:57.290> some<00:05:57.470> reason

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
envelope punch board but for some reason

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.840 
envelope punch board but for some reason
but<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.690> corrugate<00:06:00.170> it<00:06:00.410> wasn't<00:06:00.800> is<00:06:00.920> hard<00:06:01.670> to

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
but the corrugate it wasn't is hard to

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.410 
but the corrugate it wasn't is hard to
punch<00:06:02.650> but<00:06:03.650> again<00:06:04.010> you<00:06:04.400> know<00:06:04.550> use<00:06:05.390> your

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
punch but again you know use your

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.860 
punch but again you know use your
trimmer<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.560> mean<00:06:07.010> your<00:06:07.130> score<00:06:07.430> board

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
trimmer and I mean your score board

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.170 
trimmer and I mean your score board
would<00:06:08.870> probably<00:06:09.170> be<00:06:09.230> safer<00:06:09.710> but<00:06:10.120> they<00:06:11.120> were

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
would probably be safer but they were

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.360 
would probably be safer but they were
