00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
couldn't button mashing happens just

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
couldn't button mashing happens just
kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> general<00:01:25.110> question<00:01:25.439> though<00:01:25.710> about

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
kind of a general question though about

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.230 
kind of a general question though about
that<00:01:26.130> game<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.460> team<00:01:26.610> Coast<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that game will team Coast because you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.600 
that game will team Coast because you
guys<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:28.200> been<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.560> dominant<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> up

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
guys have been so dominant kind of up

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
guys have been so dominant kind of up
until<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.000> game<00:01:30.240> why<00:01:30.570> did<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> actually<00:01:31.229> get

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
until that game why did it actually get

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.340 
until that game why did it actually get
up<00:01:31.530> ahead<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> first<00:01:32.189> place<00:01:32.310> well

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
up ahead in the first place well

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
up ahead in the first place well
honestly<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.820> we

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
honestly I think is just because we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.609 
honestly I think is just because we
locked<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> first<00:01:36.780> place<00:01:36.869> yesterday<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
locked in first place yesterday so this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
locked in first place yesterday so this
game<00:01:37.770> didn't<00:01:38.070> mean<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.340> much<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.479> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
game didn't mean as much and I think we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
game didn't mean as much and I think we
just<00:01:40.159> weren't<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.460> at<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.030> they're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just weren't really at like they're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
just weren't really at like they're
mentally<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.259> were<00:01:43.380> dying<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> stuff<00:01:43.950> early

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
mentally we we were dying to stuff early

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
mentally we we were dying to stuff early
game<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.729> would<00:01:45.149> sort<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.479> hey<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
game that I would sort of be like hey I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.539 
game that I would sort of be like hey I
think<00:01:45.960> Yves<00:01:46.140> top<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:46.860> balls<00:01:47.189> would<00:01:47.399> die

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
think Yves top and then balls would die

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
think Yves top and then balls would die
and<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.450> happens<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.869> scrims<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> lot<00:01:49.470> where

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and it happens in scrims a lot where

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
and it happens in scrims a lot where
when<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> game<00:01:50.520> doesn't<00:01:50.700> matter<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.060> much<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
when the game doesn't matter as much I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
when the game doesn't matter as much I
feel<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> sort<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> slack<00:01:52.170> off<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
feel like we sort of slack off that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.399 
feel like we sort of slack off that
definitely<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.689> came<00:01:55.049> back<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
definitely just you know came back and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
definitely just you know came back and
bit<00:01:55.500> us<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.829> game<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.549> probably<00:01:56.850> should

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
bit us that game and we probably should

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.200 
bit us that game and we probably should
have<00:01:57.180> lost<00:01:57.420> honestly<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.850> wasn't<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have lost honestly so it really wasn't a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.399 
have lost honestly so it really wasn't a
good<00:02:00.329> performance<00:02:00.689> from<00:02:00.780> US<00:02:00.930> Coast<00:02:01.229> played

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
good performance from US Coast played

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.899 
good performance from US Coast played
really<00:02:01.560> well<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.100> better<00:02:02.369> than<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> guess

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
really well I think better than I guess

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
really well I think better than I guess
we<00:02:03.060> expected<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> yeah<00:02:03.930> well<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> still

which<00:03:30.970> was<00:03:31.090> really<00:03:31.240> bad<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.290> guess<00:03:32.590> we

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
which was really bad but I guess we

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
your thoughts I haven't actually I

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.810 
your thoughts I haven't actually I
played<00:05:05.290> one<00:05:05.530> game<00:05:05.740> where<00:05:05.889> I<00:05:05.979> played<00:05:06.190> Lisa<00:05:06.400> and

lost his shifters and jaw which

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.510 
lost his shifters and jaw which
apparently<00:05:08.229> has<00:05:08.440> been<00:05:08.590> winning<00:05:08.979> every<00:05:09.460> game

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
apparently has been winning every game

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.820 
apparently has been winning every game
with<00:05:09.910> mitt<00:05:10.330> or<00:05:10.600> jungle<00:05:10.870> he's<00:05:11.530> been<00:05:11.680> playing

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
with mitt or jungle he's been playing

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.860 
with mitt or jungle he's been playing
jungles<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.280> jail<00:05:12.490> he<00:05:12.850> was<00:05:12.940> like<00:05:13.030> 0<00:05:13.330> 10<00:05:13.660> and

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
jungles in jail he was like 0 10 and

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.750 
jungles in jail he was like 0 10 and
he's<00:05:13.960> still<00:05:14.169> won<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.380> game<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.710> don't<00:05:14.919> he's

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
he's still won the game I don't he's

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.879 
he's still won the game I don't he's
just<00:05:15.940> too<00:05:16.060> good<00:05:16.180> at<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.360> champion<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.440> so

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
just too good at the champion and so

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.980 
just too good at the champion and so
yeah<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.520> guess<00:05:18.669> feral<00:05:19.120> flares<00:05:19.330> really<00:05:19.810> strong

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
cloud nine well we basically just you

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.210 
cloud nine well we basically just you
know<00:05:40.870> look<00:05:41.080> at<00:05:41.169> all<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.350> changes<00:05:41.740> we<00:05:41.919> try<00:05:42.160> to

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
know look at all the changes we try to

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.040 
know look at all the changes we try to
get<00:05:42.430> an<00:05:42.550> idea<00:05:42.849> in<00:05:42.880> our<00:05:42.970> head<00:05:43.210> of<00:05:43.419> what<00:05:43.690> will<00:05:43.930> be

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
get an idea in our head of what will be

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.770 
get an idea in our head of what will be
good<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:44.800> sometimes<00:05:45.220> that's<00:05:45.669> like<00:05:45.910> it's

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
good and sometimes that's like it's

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.420 
good and sometimes that's like it's
correct<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.289> sometimes<00:05:47.620> we're<00:05:47.860> way<00:05:48.010> off<00:05:48.039> and

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
correct and sometimes we're way off and

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.040 
correct and sometimes we're way off and
then<00:05:48.669> we<00:05:49.090> just<00:05:49.210> see<00:05:49.360> what<00:05:49.479> works<00:05:49.690> you<00:05:49.840> know<00:05:49.870> in

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
then we just see what works you know in

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.260 
then we just see what works you know in
scrims<00:05:50.289> if<00:05:50.470> we<00:05:50.590> lose<00:05:50.979> consistently<00:05:51.639> to<00:05:51.760> one

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
scrims if we lose consistently to one

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.240 
scrims if we lose consistently to one
strategy<00:05:52.660> will<00:05:52.840> try<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.200> strategy<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:54.070> see

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
strategy will try that strategy to see

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.029 
strategy will try that strategy to see
if<00:05:54.870> it's<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.960> really<00:05:56.139> good<00:05:56.200> strategy<00:05:56.680> or<00:05:56.889> if

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
if it's a really good strategy or if

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.440 
if it's a really good strategy or if
we're<00:05:57.160> just<00:05:57.190> playing<00:05:57.490> badly<00:05:57.669> against<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.150> so

extremely<00:06:21.970> strong<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.389> they're<00:06:22.750> likely<00:06:23.200> to

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
extremely strong and they're likely to

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.440 
extremely strong and they're likely to
play<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:23.860> eighth<00:06:24.010> place<00:06:24.160> LCS<00:06:24.610> team<00:06:24.789> so<00:06:25.419> I
