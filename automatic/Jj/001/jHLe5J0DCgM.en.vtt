00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.430 

it's<00:00:47.760> falling<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.239> its<00:00:48.390> own<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.839> and<00:00:49.079> won't

worst<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.870> probably<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:59.030> which

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
worst one was probably this one which

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.780 
worst one was probably this one which
she<00:01:02.219> no<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.430> wasn't

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790
