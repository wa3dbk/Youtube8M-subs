 negotiation welcome to mariana many 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.190
 thanks jose mariana that is negotiation 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.010
 well I tell you jose that from the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.230
 proposal of the old link negotiation 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.690
 we have the observer of the negotiation 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.330
 as a natural talent all beings 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.360
 humans we come equipped with the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:51.019
 ability to negotiate companies have 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.540
 spent a lot of money teaching the 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.720
 employees to negotiate 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.330
 we could dedicate the talk was lost 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.050
 it's timely because there's really no 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.820
 To teach 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.030
 you have to develop some skills 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.280
 Necessary skills to negotiate 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.870
 that we already have all the basic 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 human beings we have a capacity to 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.140
 a potential a great power of 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.180
 negotiation in our human genome by 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.550
 say it like that before we continue that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.530
 is bio coaching good look at this story 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.810
 the old Austin is a discipline that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.509
 integrates traditional coaching and 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.640
 integrates ontological coaching for 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.970
 become in a discipline 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.130
 powerful coaching that brings us to 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 accompanying others the coach from the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.200
 block or from the block today we accompany 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.450
 others that they get to where 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.580
 they want to arrive based on competitions 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.500
 in five major competitions in 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.920
 five domains of the good human then 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.869
 I want to organize ideas as a little bit 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.050
 what does negotiation have to do with bio 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.920
 good coaching the old ying 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.610
 Focus 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.220
 in being 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.560
 what capabilities what talents do you have 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.960
 human being to empower the all 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.870
 talents do not focus weaknesses 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 in all the strengths that we have 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.130
 from bio coaching we understand that it is 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.140
 a being a human being has the talent of 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.640
 negotiate the ability to negotiate and the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.310
 old zinc is a tool for 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
 shoot that ability to give you more 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.340
 potential for the person to give 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.370
 account of its business capacity 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.890
 you for example look is a 3 year old boy 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.530
 if it makes you a 2 year old boy with his 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.730
 parents really making a child of 3 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.209
 years with his parents when he wants a 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.940
 sweet when general can be dad 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.670
 the executive has well-wrapped well 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.580
 seriously arrives at the house and we climb 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.130
 who wants with him because the children 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.890
 they have a great capacity to seduce the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.030
 another to achieve what he wants 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.260
 always said that children are the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.560
 best teachers and the best 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.790
 Buyers 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.530
 then the negotiations of the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.170
 first premise that the negotiation is a 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.780
 natural talent we are losing with 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.440
 the time for education by the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.840
 family system by 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.910
 society by thousands of patterns that we're going 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.220
 acquiring we are scratching our 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.830
 brain I say it like that really because 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.390
 scratch our brain and many talents 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.090
 they get lost not in all people but 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.100
 in the majority they are getting dwarfs 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.520
 I tell them they are putting dwarfs 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.080
 but the old man gives us the ability to 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.810
 realize that we have that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
 potential that we have that ability and 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.900
 we can develop them as the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.910
 we developed from the questioned as well as 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.590
 we develop it the human being has to 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.160
 develop a layer an amount of 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.650
 abilities 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.770
 of skills and abilities to 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.980
 to get to negotiate what is a 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.130
 negotiation or a negotiation really 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.170
 successful is when there is a win-win 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.560
 when I win and the other I win there are many 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.930
 negotiation possibilities 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 There is a possibility that I win 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.720
 you lose I lose you really win 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.610
 those are temporary negotiations but 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.090
 they are not permanent in time or both 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.260
 we lose or both lose exactly are 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.739
 negotiations that do not have 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.170
 many are not undefined they are not 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.840
 permanent are temporary if a client 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.440
 comes to your company but remains with the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.479
 feeling that I saw more of my yielded a 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.699
 Little is a client that may not 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.130
 come back because he moved in 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.710
 exactly and the opposite also 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.910
 they gave more friends than in debt 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.680
 possibly it will not come back either, 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.060
 in every negotiation everybody has 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.100
 to go on winning but it was not a good 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.380
 business effect everyone has to 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.479
 keep winning this is the first one is a 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.250
 fundamental premise that from the bio 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.840
 coaching we know as negotiations a 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.490
 win-win to the most accurate definition 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.610
 what are the new trends of 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.630
 negotiation now for companies look 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.479
 the negotiation trends as not 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.820
 they would believe no company are from 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.130
 of being 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.960
 if I as a human being develop my 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.180
 possibility to negotiate I can negotiate 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.970
 in any of the subjects can I 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.610
 do not know or that I do not have many 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.140
 knowledge of the reason 's 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.240
 a certain subject but if I have some 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.620
 human abilities and talents 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.500
 developed achievement any 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.510
 negotiation then the question that I 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.610
 do we go from the old one if it goes 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.389
 well focused on strengthening 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.750
 to the human potential of companies to 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.180
 that being who will negotiate beyond 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.189
 technology beyond the product that 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.770
 sell from the human being itself the 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.650
 that achieves that negotiation or that for 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.139
 start negotiating correctly 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.939
 first skills are developed and 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.550
 aptitudes of each person behind the bio 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:49.340
 coaching and then they are trained in 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.009
 perfect negotiation techniques that 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.389
 would be the correct way is understanding 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.939
 of base that all human beings 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.249
 we have a great bargaining power already 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.399
 is in us 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:03.829
 to some simple rules for a 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.389
 effective negotiation looks at some 

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.969
 negotiations that cases when I have 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.889
 the awareness that it is not the 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:12.109
 negotiation is not focused that I'm going to 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.999
 keep winning is not what I want 

00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:17.320
 is what you want is what together 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:20.140
 we wish it is the third option 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.360
 it is the third option that is going to 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.880
 benefit both when I go to a 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.370
 negotiation with a provision 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.290
 generating a whole scenario for the 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.870
 another genuinely want to negotiate 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.240
 with me 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.010
 and I 'm not, I'm going to get you winning 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.450
 the other is the two of us who are going to 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.580
 create a scenario to have a 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.650
 third option is a very negotiation 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.360
 successful then the input as 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.190
 although disposition came in I do the 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.980
 negotiation with the other 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.830
 very interesting because you are 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.960
 listening to negotiation techniques 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:56.090
 based on the bio coaching we go to a 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.090
 short commercial cut and we're back
