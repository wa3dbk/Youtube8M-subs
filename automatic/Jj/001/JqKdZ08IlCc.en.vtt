off<00:02:49.870> their<00:02:50.310> grayish<00:02:51.310> gas<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.120> then<00:02:52.319> we'll<00:02:53.319> be

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
off their grayish gas and then we'll be

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.420 
off their grayish gas and then we'll be
kind<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.040> sudden<00:02:54.670> combustion<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:56.099> gas<00:02:57.099> as

kind of a sudden combustion of gas as

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.920 
kind of a sudden combustion of gas as
you<00:02:57.519> can<00:02:57.670> see<00:02:57.849> it<00:02:57.940> trying<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.360> start<00:02:58.629> up<00:02:58.720> there

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
you can see it trying to start up there

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.970 
you can see it trying to start up there
now<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:01.000> that's<00:03:01.180> what<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.420> do<00:03:01.480> with<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.989> smart

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
