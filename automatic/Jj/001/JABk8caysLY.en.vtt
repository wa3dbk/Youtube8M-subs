throwing it away because there's some of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.680 
throwing it away because there's some of
the<00:04:28.380> other<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.710> could<00:04:28.830> use<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.419> know<00:04:30.419> every

the other that could use it I know every
now<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:30.900> then<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.050> still<00:04:31.500> get<00:04:31.650> calls<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:32.040> TV

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310

I didn't hit the glass maker for an

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.700 
I didn't hit the glass maker for an
entertainment<00:04:54.930> center<00:04:55.169> when<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.470> do<00:04:55.560> that
