00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
turn this is an older game so it's got

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.350

some<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> less<00:03:02.920> modern<00:03:03.280> design<00:03:03.850> elements

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
some of the less modern design elements

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.140 
some of the less modern design elements
to<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:04.810> player<00:03:05.200> elimination<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> losing

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to it like player elimination and losing

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.050 
to it like player elimination and losing
turns<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:09.130> whole<00:03:09.340> lot<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:09.520> randomness

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
turns and a whole lot of randomness

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.420 
turns and a whole lot of randomness
because<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:10.930> because<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.590> power<00:03:11.980> level<00:03:12.370> of

because of because of the power level of
the<00:03:12.580> cards<00:03:12.990> it's<00:03:13.990> it's<00:03:14.260> still<00:03:14.500> fun<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.340> I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
the cards it's it's still fun and I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520 
the cards it's it's still fun and I
enjoy<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.180> but<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.959> something<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.290> I

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
enjoy it but it's not something that I

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.080 
enjoy it but it's not something that I
want<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.800> play<00:03:17.890> over<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.310> over<00:03:18.430> again<00:03:18.700> or

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
want to play over and over again or

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.910 
want to play over and over again or
everyday<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.870> needs<00:03:20.200> me<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.800> right

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
everyday it needs me to be in the right

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.800 
everyday it needs me to be in the right
mood<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.370> play<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.850> think<00:03:22.360> one<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
mood to play it I think one of the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.690 
mood to play it I think one of the
reasons<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.200> do<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.100> as<00:03:24.220> much<00:03:24.250> as<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.640> do

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
reasons I do like it as much as I do

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.900 
reasons I do like it as much as I do
though<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.660> it's<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.959> clearly<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:27.100> heavy

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
though is that it's a clearly a heavy

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.000 
though is that it's a clearly a heavy
influence<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.200> design<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.470> Magic<00:03:29.890> the
