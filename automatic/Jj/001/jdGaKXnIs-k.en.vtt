changes as I'm playing and I'm out of
ideas<00:06:37.740> so<00:06:38.220> let's<00:06:38.430> just<00:06:38.640> though<00:06:38.729> some<00:06:38.910> of<00:06:39.000> the

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
ideas so let's just though some of the

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:48.060 
ideas so let's just though some of the
needs

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.280 

and<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.580> machine<00:06:48.940> room<00:06:49.150> is<00:06:49.300> outside<00:06:49.510> and

and the machine room is outside and

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.560 
and the machine room is outside and
since<00:06:50.530> it<00:06:50.680> looks<00:06:50.890> kind<00:06:51.220> of<00:06:51.370> a<00:06:51.490> little<00:06:51.880> suspect

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
since it looks kind of a little suspect

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
since it looks kind of a little suspect
to<00:06:53.080> hang<00:06:53.290> around<00:06:53.470> that<00:06:53.800> door<00:06:54.990> well<00:06:55.990> hear<00:06:56.440> it
