the<00:03:28.630> only<00:03:29.019> problem<00:03:29.470> with<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.680> shield<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.250> that

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the only problem with the shield is that

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.699 
the only problem with the shield is that
it<00:03:30.549> requires<00:03:30.790> 50<00:03:31.450> strength<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.049> wield<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.500> so

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
it requires 50 strength to wield it so

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.120 
it requires 50 strength to wield it so
it's<00:03:32.950> got<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.160> really<00:03:33.819> high<00:03:34.200> prerequisite<00:03:35.200> for

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
it's got a really high prerequisite for

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.640 
it's got a really high prerequisite for
the<00:03:36.970> strength<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:38.049> get<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the strength and you get that in the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.620 
the strength and you get that in the
same<00:03:38.889> area<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.609> you<00:03:39.850> get<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> rest<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.450> hand

now<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:50.590> kind<00:03:50.829> of<00:03:50.920> switching<00:03:51.250> back<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.430> forth

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
now I'm kind of switching back and forth

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.720 
now I'm kind of switching back and forth
between<00:03:51.970> golem<00:03:52.569> armor<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.290> smiles<00:03:54.190> armor

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
between golem armor and smiles armor

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.930 
between golem armor and smiles armor
depending<00:03:55.480> on<00:03:55.569> where<00:03:55.750> I'm<00:03:55.870> at<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.200> both<00:03:56.350> have

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
depending on where I'm at they both have

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.819 
depending on where I'm at they both have
they<00:03:57.940> both<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.329> major<00:03:58.600> stamina<00:03:59.200> reduction

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
they both have major stamina reduction

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.020 
they both have major stamina reduction
so<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.459> recover<00:04:01.120> stamina<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.630> lot<00:04:01.810> slower<00:04:02.109> but

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
so you recover stamina a lot slower but

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.250 
so you recover stamina a lot slower but
if<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.180> have<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.450> ring<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.720> favor<00:04:04.959> and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
if you have the ring a favor and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.190 
if you have the ring a favor and
protection<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.190> also<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:07.030> chlorin<00:04:08.019> the--

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
protection and also the chlorin the--

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.540 
protection and also the chlorin the--
ring<00:04:08.440> from<00:04:09.480> from

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
ring from from

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.430 
ring from from
the<00:04:12.550> great<00:04:12.820> hollow<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.570> boosts<00:04:14.140> our<00:04:14.230> stamina

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
the great hollow that boosts our stamina

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.410 
the great hollow that boosts our stamina
recoveries<00:04:15.070> feeding<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.640> kind<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.060> negates

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
recoveries feeding that kind of negates

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.319 
recoveries feeding that kind of negates
both<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.470> that's<00:04:18.459> what<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.730> is

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
both of that so that's what it is

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.210 
both of that so that's what it is
best<00:04:19.810> armor<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.320> shields<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.799> game<00:04:20.980> for
