like to talk to you today about
propagation<00:00:10.020> by<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.500> vision<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.340> our<00:00:11.700> root

propagation by the vision of our root

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
propagation by the vision of our root
systems<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.930> have<00:00:13.110> four<00:00:13.349> main<00:00:13.710> systems<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
systems we have four main systems that

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.000 
systems we have four main systems that
we<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:15.420> propagate<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.439> is<00:00:16.590> our<00:00:16.770> bowls

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
we use to propagate one is our bowls

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
we use to propagate one is our bowls
then<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> rhizomes<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:19.349> have<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
then we have the rhizomes we have the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
then we have the rhizomes we have the
chrome<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> tubers<00:00:21.660> the

daffodil bulb and when you take it out

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.980 
daffodil bulb and when you take it out
of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> ground<00:00:26.850> after<00:00:27.300> their<00:00:27.539> fight<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> the

get two or more that would be attached a

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.440 
get two or more that would be attached a
simple<00:00:32.830> matter<00:00:33.010> of<00:00:33.370> breaking<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.030> right<00:00:34.300> of

simple matter of breaking the right of

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.810 
simple matter of breaking the right of
heart<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:34.960> then<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:35.530> have<00:00:35.740> to<00:00:36.010> post<00:00:36.670> the

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
heart and then you have to post the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.820 
heart and then you have to post the
mother<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.390> daughter<00:00:37.630> plants<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.470> then

mother and the daughter plants and then
you<00:00:38.950> plant<00:00:39.160> those<00:00:39.280> back<00:00:39.520> into<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.910> ground<00:00:40.120> the

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
you plant those back into the ground the

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.950 
you plant those back into the ground the
proper<00:00:40.480> length<00:00:40.810> here<00:00:41.620> we<00:00:41.770> walk<00:00:41.950> over<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.809> also

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
proper length here we walk over we also

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.229 
proper length here we walk over we also
have<00:00:44.170> our<00:00:44.350> heist<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:44.950> bulbs<00:00:45.400> which<00:00:45.879> is<00:00:46.030> the

have our heist and bulbs which is the
some<00:00:46.660> positive<00:00:47.140> color<00:00:47.350> this<00:00:47.530> would<00:00:47.739> be<00:00:47.860> a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
some positive color this would be a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.979 
some positive color this would be a
purple<00:00:48.340> icing<00:00:48.580> right<00:00:48.940> here<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.750> way<00:00:49.930> you

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
purple icing right here the way you

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.990 
purple icing right here the way you
always<00:00:50.260> know<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.620> plant<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.070> bulbs<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.550> quite

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
always know the plant the bulbs is quite

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.970 
always know the plant the bulbs is quite
something<00:00:52.570> circumference<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.770> bulb

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
something circumference of the bulb

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.890 
something circumference of the bulb
that's<00:00:54.400> how<00:00:54.610> deep<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.150> you<00:00:55.390> would<00:00:55.660> plant

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
that's how deep that you would plant

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.720 
that's how deep that you would plant
them<00:00:56.050> in<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.230> largest<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.220> deeper<00:00:57.430> it

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
them in the largest of all the deeper it

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.450 
them in the largest of all the deeper it
goes<00:00:58.080> one<00:00:59.080> of<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.260> other<00:00:59.470> divisions<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.190> we

goes one of the other divisions that we

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.299 
goes one of the other divisions that we
have<00:01:00.699> your<00:01:00.940> fine<00:01:01.150> day<00:01:01.420> lilies<00:01:01.839> and<00:01:02.050> in<00:01:02.769> Mary

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
have your fine day lilies and in Mary

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.000 
have your fine day lilies and in Mary
opium<00:01:03.729> which<00:01:03.970> we<00:01:04.180> call<00:01:04.750> monkey<00:01:05.080> grass<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.830> so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
opium which we call monkey grass and so

opium which we call monkey grass and so
forth<00:01:06.310> we<00:01:06.460> are<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.690> tubers<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.290> they<00:01:08.800> are

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
forth we are the tubers and they are

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.980 
forth we are the tubers and they are
just<00:01:09.250> small<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.880> public<00:01:10.330> like<00:01:10.570> things<00:01:10.840> that

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
just small the public like things that

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.590 
just small the public like things that
are<00:01:11.140> on<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.409> bottom<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.640> plant<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.330> each

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
are on the bottom of the plant and each

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.420 
are on the bottom of the plant and each
one<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.900> these<00:01:14.080> are<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> stalks<00:01:14.680> after<00:01:15.370> you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
one of these are the stalks after you

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.160 
one of these are the stalks after you
come<00:01:15.580> out<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.850> cluster<00:01:16.330> actually<00:01:16.990> as<00:01:17.140> a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
come out of the cluster actually as a

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.680 
come out of the cluster actually as a
plant<00:01:17.560> if<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.490> happens<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.880> be<00:01:18.970> drive<00:01:19.299> when<00:01:19.600> you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
plant if it happens to be drive when you

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.120 
plant if it happens to be drive when you
buy<00:01:19.840> just<00:01:19.990> soak<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.650> for<00:01:20.680> just<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:21.010> little<00:01:21.130> bit

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
buy just soak it for just a little bit

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.649 
buy just soak it for just a little bit
put<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.520> ground<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.509> got

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
put it in the ground and you have got

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.740 
put it in the ground and you have got
that<00:01:23.869> plan<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.979> notion<00:01:25.189> we<00:01:25.549> have<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
that plan the notion we have is the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.959 
that plan the notion we have is the
rhizomes<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:28.100> would<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.399> get<00:01:28.610> from<00:01:28.850> the

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
rhizomes and this would you get from the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.600 
rhizomes and this would you get from the
iris<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.869> from<00:01:30.049> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
iris and from the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.730 
iris and from the
cannibalism<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.750> plant<00:01:32.050> suppose<00:01:32.380> that

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
cannibalism and plant suppose that

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.010 
cannibalism and plant suppose that
nature<00:01:32.980> first<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.120> all<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:34.480> was<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.810> mother

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
nature first of all this was the mother

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.470 
nature first of all this was the mother
plant<00:01:35.410> when<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.250> was<00:01:36.370> planted<00:01:36.790> in<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:37.120> couple

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
plant when we was planted in a couple

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.410 
plant when we was planted in a couple
years<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:38.170> would<00:01:38.320> produce<00:01:38.890> two<00:01:39.640> more<00:01:39.880> they<00:01:40.360> are

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
years it would produce two more they are

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.480 
years it would produce two more they are
easy<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.110> break<00:01:41.320> up<00:01:41.530> right<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.070> areas

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
easy just to break up right in the areas

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.640 
easy just to break up right in the areas
where<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.790> would<00:01:42.940> see<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.600> indentions<00:01:44.230> just

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
where you would see the indentions just

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.620 
where you would see the indentions just
take<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.980> knife<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.460> cut<00:01:45.700> them<00:01:45.850> apart<00:01:45.940> and

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
take the knife and cut them apart and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.590 
take the knife and cut them apart and
each<00:01:46.840> one<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.110> these<00:01:47.380> becomes<00:01:48.280> another<00:01:49.000> planet

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
each one of these becomes another planet

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.120 
each one of these becomes another planet
just<00:01:49.750> cut<00:01:49.960> them<00:01:50.080> into<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.680> you've<00:01:50.770> got<00:01:50.950> your

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
just cut them into and you've got your

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.210 
just cut them into and you've got your
second

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
second

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.740
