00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
injector I ran them through my

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.730 
injector I ran them through my
ultrasonic<00:02:04.490> cleaner<00:02:04.700> for<00:02:05.200> 10<00:02:06.200> minutes<00:02:06.560> or<00:02:06.710> so

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
ultrasonic cleaner for 10 minutes or so

hours clean them up real well I had a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.229 
hours clean them up real well I had a
connector<00:02:15.590> from<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> old<00:02:16.070> engine<00:02:17.060> harness

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
connector from the old engine harness

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.500 
connector from the old engine harness
just<00:02:17.600> hooked<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.110> up<00:02:18.370> six<00:02:19.370> volt<00:02:19.670> battery<00:02:20.030> put

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
just hooked it up six volt battery put

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.590 
just hooked it up six volt battery put
pretty<00:02:20.690> quick<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.350> can<00:02:21.500> hear<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.860> cylinder

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
pretty quick you can hear the cylinder

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.290 
pretty quick you can hear the cylinder
moving<00:02:23.600> inside<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.260> tells<00:02:24.470> me<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
moving inside that tells me that the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.410 
moving inside that tells me that the
injector<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.780> working<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.910> we'll<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:29.180> a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
injector is working so we'll see a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.970 
injector is working so we'll see a
couple<00:02:30.019> more<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.320> do<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.709> I'll<00:02:30.769> have<00:02:30.950> all
