00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.870
 last weekend the competition laughed silently 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.609
 Dutch team finally played 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.589
 matches against turkey 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.710
 ek qualification and last Tuesday 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.900
 against Spain a practice match 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.759
 otherwise pick up and then the thread again 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 and started preparing for the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.840
 important competition match tomorrow 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 evening against FC Twente did the same 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.680
 today behind closed doors 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.300
 phillip cocu wanted to get up in peace 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.580
 prepare that important competition 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.720
 and was happy that everyone was fresh and fruity 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.920
 was back 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 yes they have all returned 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.170
 I was important 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.700
 interests themselves also countless and all 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.050
 represent teams are too 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 big 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 players have returned well and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640
 Thursday was once again able to connect 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.399
 and the trainers 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 important to prepare the set against 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 twente i know you two days 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.350
 can normally prepare how 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 wash your week with orange yes always nice to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.840
 young bulls there again 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.699
 yes sometimes it also looks good with 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.699
 which is nice to see again and yes 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 a nice with those orange men and also 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.949
 equally nice different environment it makes you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.949
 what fresh in your head 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.799
 I don't mind much 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.220
 I like you so that man 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 very much but it is what i say in the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.619
 good feeling that you are there 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 a it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.159
 can take part in the turbo block competition 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 this you can play it did not happen 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 but hopefully I found him and also good 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 from the Netherlands and the good win or 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.369
 Spain achieved yes then you come anyway 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.750
 otherwise back there you are also that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.590
 lose or draw a match 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.360
 I think 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.850
 yes, because it always has that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.979
 influence on players 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 the feeling that you have a good result 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.930
 take with you and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 so everyone came positive 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 positive inside and the links between 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 tent and psv are for example assistants 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.760
 he is coach Chris van der Weerden 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.980
 once played for the team from enschede 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.470
 but most recently Luuk de Jong did it 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.300
 that your the boy became national champion with 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.510
 fc twente and played there three seasons 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.820
 but even scored against FC Twente in 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.740
 the home match of psv on December 14 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.870
 from last year 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.820
 here until the first ball of match took 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.560
 inside and of course it stays special 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.500
 for him to go back to enschede 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.709
 I had a very nice period there 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.600
 played for three years and that quite a bit 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.940
 also experienced one 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.220
 yes he has had one early 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.410
 specially for and I think it's fun 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.459
 to see the people coming back 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.840
 working on it 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.150
 he must say guys play here now 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.680
 which really is the language of the ten 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.280
 almost none of the natural anymore 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.080
 stuff 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.020
 put something in the tent this year 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.850
 the type of free fall has ended up 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.730
 I think it's a shame to see that 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.780
 is it like it was when i played there 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.580
 there a top club and yes it would be good for that 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.010
 each other you also so that could stay there 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.200
 and it is unfortunate that now that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.239
 a difficult phase it and who knows come 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.440
 such a big trend i recently got three 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.940
 points deducted because of the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.590
 financial situation at the club at the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.750
 threatens for the second time next week 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.850
 to happen this season but Tuesday 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.280
 plays FC Twente in the semifinals of 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.620
 the knvb cup against pec zwolle and for 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.870
 media suggest that twente die 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 competition much more important than the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.470
 League match 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.390
 Saturday night against PSV a number 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.090
 players is injured and other players 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.350
 would be spared and maybe that 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.650
 they with some players that light 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.620
 being injured do not take risks 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.040
 I can understand that but I think 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 that just there 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.890
 very strong team of twente 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.870
 that we certainly not with a rather 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.180
 estimate that may be allowed to go that is 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.950
 it takes the pitfalls 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.200
 yes you think of being with the thought 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.670
 all the rest of who they are and that 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.909
 will certainly be the case state always 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.890
 prestige played against psv and according 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.629
 it is important to a good 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.370
 to respond 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.560
 that result in rotterdam expects that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.120
 is also just like and will find it 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.310
 it's just not a taxi match 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.260
 to us is yes what it says 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.150
 we are just prepared for one 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.519
 difficult match there and we will 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.769
 just have to be very sharp yourself 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.280
 constructed and we just want to 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.349
 like to win 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.290
 there does the language of luuk de jong and 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.280
 PSV is possible except for Santiago Arias 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.959
 take office 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.120
 that is quite special in the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.959
 decisive stage of the competition has 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.509
 psv 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.099
 virtually no injuries on that one to 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.329
 at least the foot injury of 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.820
 santiago arias 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.710
 yes it does not anti flash or it lasts longer 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.940
 well hoped 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.270
 how does he keep hanging in his 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.440
 suppose that will take a while 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.710
 the rest is 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.710
 is fit
