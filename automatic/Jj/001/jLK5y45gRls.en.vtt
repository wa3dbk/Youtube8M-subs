00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.420 

so<00:00:59.540> now<00:00:59.630> I<00:00:59.660> just<00:00:59.780> need<00:00:59.900> to<00:00:59.990> dig<00:01:00.230> down<00:01:00.740> two

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
so now I just need to dig down two

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.350 
so now I just need to dig down two
blocks<00:01:01.580> so<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:02.360> can<00:01:02.480> go<00:01:02.630> beneath<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.110> spawner

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
blocks so I can go beneath the spawner

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.730 
blocks so I can go beneath the spawner
dig<00:01:05.360> out<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.600> entire<00:01:05.900> room<00:01:08.440> be<00:01:09.440> sure<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.650> leave

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740

those dirt blocks with the torches on

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.430 
those dirt blocks with the torches on
them<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.900> spawner<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.229> still

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
them so the spawner is still

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:23.280 
them so the spawner is still
incapacitated

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
then those last two blocks down pull out

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.550 
then those last two blocks down pull out
your<00:02:31.690> two<00:02:31.780> water<00:02:31.990> buckets<00:02:34.290> place<00:02:35.290> them<00:02:35.470> in

there it is the surface you're going to
wanna<00:06:02.620> place<00:06:02.770> a<00:06:02.800> sign<00:06:03.069> so<00:06:03.370> you'll<00:06:03.490> know<00:06:03.610> in<00:06:03.669> the

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
wanna place a sign so you'll know in the

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:25.890 
wanna place a sign so you'll know in the
future<00:06:03.970> what<00:06:04.120> this<00:06:04.240> ladder<00:06:04.449> leads<00:06:04.690> to

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.760 

so<00:06:26.900> let's<00:06:27.050> head<00:06:27.170> down<00:06:27.290> and<00:06:27.440> collect<00:06:27.650> some

so let's head down and collect some
string<00:06:28.010> I<00:06:29.620> got<00:06:30.620> kind<00:06:30.770> of<00:06:30.800> lazy<00:06:30.980> and<00:06:31.220> I<00:06:31.430> didn't

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
string I got kind of lazy and I didn't

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.940 
string I got kind of lazy and I didn't
dig<00:06:31.970> this<00:06:32.120> out<00:06:32.330> two<00:06:32.750> blocks<00:06:32.990> wide<00:06:33.200> so<00:06:33.620> I<00:06:33.650> can't

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
dig this out two blocks wide so I can't

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.770 
dig this out two blocks wide so I can't
fall<00:06:34.190> I<00:06:34.430> just<00:06:34.730> have<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:34.910> travel<00:06:35.270> at<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.600> latter

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
fall I just have to travel at the latter

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.710 
fall I just have to travel at the latter
speed<00:06:36.140> so<00:06:36.530> I'll<00:06:36.590> speed<00:06:36.800> it<00:06:36.890> up<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.070> little<00:06:37.220> bit

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:58.720 

and<00:06:41.720> here<00:06:42.350> we<00:06:42.440> are<00:06:57.160> you<00:06:58.160> can<00:06:58.310> use<00:06:58.400> this<00:06:58.520> mob
