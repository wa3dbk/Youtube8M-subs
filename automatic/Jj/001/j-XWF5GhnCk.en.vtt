00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.600
 I feel off here 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.820
 Quarter of 2010 after the match 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.820
 the fantastic thing is the Lufthansa in 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.939
 in sight 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.939
 Whose under tourism view 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.079
 meanwhile runs 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.079
 The quality of the outdated they are not 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 century 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 Cuno Schreyl 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 it is now also reinforced 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 not for everyone 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 Roshan 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 with system that is 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.770
 Worpswede 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 it is interesting 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 the principle is based 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 or should 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.530
 it is a whole 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.580
 Bord FDP 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.900
 life on a long distances 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.240
 in the case of the air 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.020
 you have to say though 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.320
 give the pony 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.880
 according to paper 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.730
 and 20 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.650
 now also stand in the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 not at first glance 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.379
 which had just been allocated in passing, Nelson found drinks 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.959
 it is correct that no fluids are thrown on board 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.959
 certainly it is cold that can 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.610
 most prominent adjusted 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.109
 but very much 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.200
 Euro after on 07 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 this corresponds to a sum 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.410
 it is said in it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.259
 but this is one 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.029
 spoken out 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.869
 his goal, however, was to cry 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.869
 it was up to 5 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.599
 I eat a food 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.879
 carry-on baggage 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.879
 prescribed larger prescribed weight 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.029
 was very disappointed 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:53.399
 high quality 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.809
 Electronics, however, must be the Berger 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.809
 then stowed away 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.449
 Jeb Bush a lot 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 Who does not have the opportunity says Korczak will do in the future 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 provided luggage compartment too early 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.609
 the thaw brings
