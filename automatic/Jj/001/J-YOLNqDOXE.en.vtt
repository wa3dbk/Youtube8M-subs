00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hello everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.350
 today for a new video is 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.359
 today I was talking to you about a book 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 that I already touched on the channel to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.920
 many times I think I'll 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.889
 pretty basin with this story since 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 now almost two years but it's 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.350
 not serious 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.449
 today at least this week is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.770
 a special week a week 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.270
 important and I told myself that this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.410
 would be interesting to go back over 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.210
 if you follow me on twitter and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 company you know from which book I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 want to talk and that's obviously the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.429
 out of toothless aristotle discovers the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 secrets of the universe of benjamin to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.680
 the iris haynes appeared in or appear 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.120
 super qu'ag on June 18, 2015 so according to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.590
 the time the day you look 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 this video it may be already 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 come out and obviously if I do this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 video is to invite you strongly 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 to go buy it then to start 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 I invite you to admire the beauty 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 not paying attention and little post-it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.789
 it's obviously the quotes that I have 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 started to notice that I loved 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.770
 especially the cover is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.870
 divine they kept the cover 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.379
 original but there are some small 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.539
 differences 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 Note namely firstly that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.090
 titles and in beauce and so he is in 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.619
 relief 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.350
 we will say on the cover but 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.900
 also on the back and believe me it's 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.700
 just divine frankly very beautiful 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.990
 job 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.150
 likewise the back cover is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.979
 a little less crowded than in the book 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.630
 original and besides if you saw 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.220
 the new editions in English you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.439
 have seen that there are lozenges that are 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.299
 integrated directly into the cover 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.210
 are all the prices that the book has won 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.590
 so suddenly it's great that the book 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.320
 has won awards but it's true that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.549
 it's a shame to have them 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 put like that on the cover 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.729
 besides the prices he won I 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.990
 go sites and now because 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.640
 I think it's still important 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 to note then it will be necessary that I 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 turn my head because I read them on 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 my little paper I do not have them at all 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.460
 of head 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.079
 he won in 2013 the prince a love 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.640
 story book award the why he's frolicking 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.750
 home fiction most will have beautiful press 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 so I do not know them crazy I know 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 the first two only 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.750
 but here I think it can be a little 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.070
 can help you understand how much 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.939
 this book is great I think they 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770
 would not have won so much prize this 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.509
 was not the case 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 besides nature or drid and 4 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.740
 score 3 out of 5 on 40000 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.240
 tation so here I know it's not 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.590
 necessarily for everyone the same 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.020
 thing I doubt there will be people 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.730
 that do not necessarily go but 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.780
 sincerely I think that if all the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.640
 world can more or less put itself 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.110
 agree on that is that this book in 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 really worth the candle and me in 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 Anyway I can recommend you to 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.390
 all my heart because here it is 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.120
 of my favorite books in the world 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.740
 I put them on my top ten of 2013 and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.690
 also on the eleven books that have 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.070
 changed my life I'll put you both 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.480
 videos link info bar if you 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.980
 did not see them i'm going now 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.600
 you read the little summary that there is in 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.890
 back cover for those who 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.090
 have not heard of the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.660
 book what did you do these 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.100
 last years 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.870
 you lived in a cave I do not 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.950
 do not know but it does not matter because 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.930
 now you see 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.760
 soon he will go out where he will already be 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.740
 out that we'll see the video and 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.060
 blow you can rush on this 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.650
 does not matter if you do not have it 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.870
 still that you see not heard yet 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.790
 talk about him and so the synopsis is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.620
 harry part 15 is a teenager in 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.080
 silent anger whose brother is in 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.630
 prison in yours is a boy 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.910
 expansive funny sure of it they do have a 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.200
 priori nothing in common 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.880
 yet they do not have a deep friendship 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.580
 one of those relationships that change lives 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.050
 forever so it's one with the other and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.300
 for each other than both boys 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.340
 will go in search of their identity and 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.550
 discover the secrets of the universe 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.040
 it's a sign that's what's all about 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.020
 representative of history and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.690
 it's very good that he was not more 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.120
 far because this book I think it takes 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.920
 to experience it 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.840
 I will not tell you much more 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.400
 on the on the story because I think 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.740
 that what they said was the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.959
 main thing is the story of a boy 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.540
 of harry narrator who is 15 years old he is 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.990
 lost he's pretty sad he feels 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.890
 only 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.330
 he has a lot of problems but he knows 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.620
 not necessarily what are these problems 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.700
 he does not know why he's still in 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.160
 anger he does not know why he is 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.400
 sad he asks himself the question he is 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 here he has parents who love him his 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.450
 father who does not really know how the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.800
 show her mother who shows her here and 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.420
 one day he meets in your then 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.940
 that he has no friends because here he is 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.470
 does not feel at all integrated into 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.810
 this society in which he is at in 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.150
 know that this book is going on in 1987 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.450
 in the southern United States 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.640
 so that's what makes us 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.520
 a little bit back in the past 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.630
 spoil a little bit and here it is 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.720
 meet one day in you're a guy 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.180
 so strange and at the same time 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.190
 so smiling and giving us 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.630
 we want to smile we go it's 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.890
 totally what happened in the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.120
 book I was always trying 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.310
 smile at the beginning of the book when he is 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.750
 arrived and at the same time I had this little 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.430
 pinch to the heart for harry because 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.840
 I recognized myself in this 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.490
 character even though I'm not a 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.500
 boy i did not live in the united states 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.550
 that I am not Mexican because there is 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.900
 a lot of things at this level 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.020
 also on Mexican families 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.890
 American so here I am not the same 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.810
 but I think we can all 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.110
 find at some point in one 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.240
 of the two especially if we have with a 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.620
 extraordinary adolescence and I think 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.180
 that it is not necessarily the case of 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.490
 a lot of people teen is a 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.350
 period of life that's not easy on 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.150
 is always looking for identity 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.250
 that kind of stuff and that's it for me what 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.650
 book is exactly that it's full of 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.260
 fineness is full of correctness has 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.050
 beautifully well written it's 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.480
 different characters colorful 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.110
 and the further we go in the book because 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.700
 that history happens over a year 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.050
 the more we evolve and the more we feel 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.140
 characters are also evolving 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.580
 and we evolve with them and that's it for me 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.170
 it is a very beautiful experience of 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.330
 reading I recommend it again one 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.880
 time I think I will not stop 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.080
 repeat until the end of time but 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.310
 it's really a book to read for me 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.320
 here I read them again there is not very 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.450
 a long time and I lived the same things 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.390
 that during my first reading I 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.490
 you besides other things and 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.320
 I sincerely hope that if you 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.820
 read and I sincerely hope that you 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.200
 read it you'll go cowardly that you 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.120
 go and borrow whatever you want 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.560
 that you will like it or that you will 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.970
 find at least something because 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.000
 that actually we do not have all the 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.890
 same tastes I could not guarantee 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.780
 to 500,000 people that these five hundred 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.210
 a thousand people will love it but 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.310
 sincerely read the fact of being clean 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.490
 opinion but I hope you'll find 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.320
 a little something here you are 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.400
 will love the story of harry and in 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.449
 the tea you are going 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.150
 and tie you a little bit to 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.139
 character this is a book on the 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.729
 family is a book about friendship 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:34.650
 it's a book about self-discovery 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:36.180
 and it's perfect from the outside until 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.449
 inside until the last page and 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:43.919
 there are so many tooth quotes 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.810
 who for me touched me but really 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.600
 sincerely and the only thing that 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.210
 I would like to say because I was able to 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.750
 little bit looked at between the vo version and 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.940
 CFB Version that there to 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.560
 translations that finally sentences or 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.380

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.270
 modified or removed so know 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.270
 from before there may be some 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.310
 differences between vo and vf but 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.050
 I still hope that if you do not read 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.979
 not in you and you will read it 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.199
