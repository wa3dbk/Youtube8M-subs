00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 these are 10 strange photographs with 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.259
 tragic stories behind continuing the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.880
 previous video here we will see other 8 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.980
 photographs with stories rather 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 again frightening reminder that if 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 well the photographs do not cause any 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.379
 impact the stories that you will hear behind 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 of them and they do it so if 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 You are the type of person who spend it 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.869
 wrong with unfair raw stories and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.810
 some inhuman better will be no 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 continue let's start this list in the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 placed number 10 with the interior of the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.449
 auschwitz gas chambers what are you 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.669
 seeing right now are the signs of the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 despair is not just an old wall 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.180
 without more as you will guess but the interior 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.059
 from one of the gas chambers in 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.670
 auschwitz and white marks scratches 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 of those who were inside 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.030
 people who for pain anguish and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 the despair wanted to get out of there 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 outside as if with only this image 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 we can glimpse the pain I do not want 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 imagine the madness of the moment and with 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.489
 all those people scratching the wall in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 the number 9 place we have the last 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.050
 family photo the photo that we see here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.449
 speaks for itself by celebrating the arrival 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.760
 of the new year reinaldo photographed to his 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 family coincidences of life that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.590
 right at that moment of taking the picture 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 portrait also his killer leaning on 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.970
 the car and pointing directly at 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 man identified himself as michael 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.930
 Gonzalez and also the police said that the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 another boy on the right also 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 I was involved right after doing 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.290
 the photograph received several shots in 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 the chest and in the injured arms that 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 caused death upon arrival at the hospital 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.930
 at number 8 we have the funeral 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.150
 of Vladimir Komarov in 1967 were assigned 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.649
 to two cosmonauts yuri and vladimir for 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.270
 orbit the earth as a way of 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.119
 celebrate the 50th anniversary of the revolution 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.470
 communist the matter would not go beyond 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.049
 not because when they reviewed the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.509
 capsule this one presented 203 problems 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.009
 structural, but despite that, no one 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.439
 dared to prevent it from being 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.210
 march the mission the / accepted to go in that 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.189
 ship still knowing that he would die because of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.649
 to refuse would have touched his friend 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.360
 yuri yuri his friend sent a letter to 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.670
 responsible for notifying you of the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.710
 situation but mysteriously the letter 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.289
 did not get anywhere and the mission 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.269
 the end would still stand therefore 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.519
 was predictable with the failures that 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.680
 presented the ship it started to fall and 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.140
 what we hear in the background is Vladimir 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.850
 at that precise moment it translates into 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.010
 when it was falling and when the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.709
 parachutes captured their crying rage 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.540
 before dying that yes before mounting 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.040
 in the capsule he asked that his funeral be 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 with the coffin open for all 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.390
 could see the fate he had 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 at number 7 we have the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.040
 shadows of the dead in hiroshima a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 tragic story the atomic bombs 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.610
 released in Japan are commonly used 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.830
 to show what you should never 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.380
 repeat death and misfortune during 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.450
 years after the nuclear bomb to 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.400
 hiroshima is drawn in some cases 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 a kind of shadows showing the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
 exact place where the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.130
 victims just at the time of the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.540
 explosion these shadows tell the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.580
 History better than any historian 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.319
 since if you look closely you 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.150
 they will tell what nobody else can tell you 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.609
 in position number 6 we have the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.989
 car-pump at this point in each 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.549
 new post in the 'top we started to 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.650
 prepare our bodies so that a 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.139
 once we see the photograph we take what 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.969
 worse in this case we have the picture of a 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.650
 man carrying a child on his shoulders and not 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.659
 in this case the man did not kill the boy 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.280
 or anything similar but what happened 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.620
 is that the red car that is just 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.829
 parked next door was a car-bomb with 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.139
 140 kilos of explosives the explosion of 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.730
 car left 29 dead man and the 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.650
 child luckily they were at the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.870
 just distance to not die the one that 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.750
 took the photograph however yes that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.389
 died at number 5 we have 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.180
 the human avalanche in hillsborough this 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.099
 case became quite famous because in 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.299
 1989 during a football match 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.699
 happened the tragedy that almost claimed 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.590
 100 lives were not fights of the 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.269
 fanatics or anything similar but a 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.799
 human avalanche occurred at 6 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.019
 minutes of starting the game and 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.519
 canceled on the spot the people are 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.900
 pressed between them and against the railings 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.790
 of security to the point of no 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.090
 let them move at all and not only 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.650
 that but also could not breathe 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.840
 in the end almost 100 people died 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.069
 trampled or suffocated leaving others 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.980
 700 more with him 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.650
 serious in the position number 4 we have the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.090
 golden gate bridge what we see here the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.130
 yellow machine that appears is not 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.509
 no normal telephone booth but 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.340
 a help line in case you have 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.829
 intention to commit suicide and you need 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.360
 advice and encouragement not to jump the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.160
 golden gate bridge has such a fame 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.320
 bad that many of the people who 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.000
 they want to commit suicide come here 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.470
 Because of this, they decided to install these 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.479
 devices that we see as a measure for 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 deter suicides and encourage them to 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.110
 move on and the one who took the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.000
 photography it seemed appropriate to do 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.030
 just at the moment when someone 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.070
 I needed help not to kill myself in the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.860
 put number 3 we have the last day of 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.300
 prison this photograph almost looks like a 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.160
 drawing for the poor condition of the woman 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.630
 but that's how they found it 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 after her mother kept her 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.840
 locked for 24 years occurred in 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.310
 France in 1901 the photo is the first 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.710
 what was done after finding it in the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.870
 room for 24 years care 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.120
 received was the minimum locked in with 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.490
 locked and watched forced to live between 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.380
 their own excrement because even to go 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.389
 to the bathroom they let her go when the 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.310
 they found was 49 years old and when 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.849
 they threw the door down they described the 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.590
 panorama 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.510
 the following way 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.460
 the woman lay in bed naked 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.680
 cover to the head with a sheet 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.060
 grimy around him he formed a 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.370
 kind of bark made by the 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.830
 excrement remains of vegetable meat 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.210
 fish and rotten bread the air was 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.130
 unbreathable and insects and 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.560
 cockroaches were the least repulsion 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.270
 it gave from that room stomps that with the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.490
 time the woman gained some weight never 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.490
 He regained his sanity and died 12 years 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.440
 then in a psychiatric hospital in 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.290
 place number 2 we have resin cake 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.270
 wolters this photo shows the reggina one 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.040
 14 year old girl who was killed by 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.130
 Robert Bentley There's the author of the 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.570
 photography this killer was characterized 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.310
 for traveling the country in his truck 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.650
 equipped on the back with a 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.820
 true torture chamber took advantage of the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.530
 moment in which resin had 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.200
 escaped from home and was with the boyfriend 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.420
 to kidnap them both ben rhodes a 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.980
 former military was picking up hitchhikers 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.570
 and prostitutes for later 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.180
 move them to the back and 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.800
 torture them to death the part of 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.290
 back I had a dirty mattress and some 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.490
 chains on one of the walls between 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.730
 instruments could be found 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.460
 wives whips dildos straps and 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.740
 multitude of needles and several tools 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.169
 for 15 years he was circling and 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.699
 killing with his truck the photograph 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.620
 that we see was the result of the last 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.380
 fantasy of the killer who cut him the 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.729
 hair and made her put on that dress 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.800
 where they are is a farm 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.569
 abandoned in illinois place where 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.300
 later found the body of the 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:44.120
 girl boyfriend yet never 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.620
 found nothing and finally in the post 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.470
 number one we have the death of the 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.910
 engineers in a windmill there 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.319
 times when nothing can be done 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.930
 times when you get too 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.340
 late like what happened in this mill 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.740
 of wind in which two workers 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.030
 they were trapped by the fire not 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.979
 there is greater impotence than that 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.650
 we see now neither forward nor back 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.509
 neither up nor down just a small place 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.400
 that is consumed little by little by the 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.050
 fire and that will force the workers 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.680
 to decide how they want 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.180
 jump or stay and die burn the 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.009
