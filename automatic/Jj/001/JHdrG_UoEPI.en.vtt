00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello I am today with 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 stéphane blanchet chef and founder 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.519
 gourmet initiation 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.080
 he shows you how to make a dessert 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 that we find very often at the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 map of restaurants the famous cream 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 burned then you are greedy you 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.869
 love the crème brûlée 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 you will see nothing easier 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.730
 for that you need us 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.290
 yellow a little bit of cream sugar 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.800
 liquid or milk cream a milk 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.340
 little bit of vanilla and of course 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 sugar brown sugar to caramelize 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.559
 cream 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 once it is cooked in a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.850
 first time let's put the milk 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.059
 and the cream to heat in a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.059
 pan 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.220
 add the milk and heat 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.400
 during that time we are going to mix 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.670
 yolks and sugar in a salad bowl 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.360
 it's gone I promise yellow game the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.360
 green in a salad bowl 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:24.360
 I add sugar and with a whip we go 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 whiten yolks and sugar 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.300
 so that the sugar is well melted 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.090
 with the yellows like that it's perfect 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.530
 my milk and hot I'm going to pour the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.100
 small vanilla liquid to perfume a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.509
 little bit like these and I pour 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:02:02.020
 then my hot milk on the mix 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:02:04.090
 yellow sugar then we mix and I 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.070
 will pour after this device into my 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.120
 mussels with crème brûlée so mussels 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.450
 not too thick and I pour it to the brim 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.450
 like this 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.920
 that's it and then we'll go to the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.579
 cooking we will now put them in 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.049
 oven then important cooking at 100 ° not 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.209
 the more we not put them in a water bath 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.489
 but cooking at 100 ° and you will have 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.030
 creme brulee that will be perfect even 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.890
 more than perfect our crème brûlées 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.150
 are ready 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.019
 so look at the little thing to find out 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.329
 if they are well cooked 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.299
 you take the crème brûlée shake you 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.629
 and when it stays firm, it's 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.489
 it's cooked 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.560
 this one it remains a little liquid 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.810
 inside it may still be missing 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.609
 2 or 3 minutes of cooking on attack 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.870
 the final phase we will caramelize 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.319
 our cream 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:03.090
 we go there burned we'll put a little bit of 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.919
 sugar brown sugar on it we do not put 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.430
 not too much we sprinkle 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:11.489
 this is all that's perfect 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.159
 and then we will use the torch 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.959
 so in the absence of a torch I understand 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.120
 everyone does not necessarily have that at the 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.069
 home you can put your cream 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.010
 burned in the oven under the salamander 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.479
 that is to say under the grid very very 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.979
 hot you and then to caramelize 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.290
 like that it will be longer 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.400
 it may be a little less good it is 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.860
 left 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.189
 and we're going to caramelize that 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.189
 slowly 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.460
 here we are caramelized both 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.560
 evenings to prevent it from starting cisco 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.700
 quickly and it burns look here it 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.700
 start to take a nice color 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.420
 do not put the flame too close 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.420
 more sugar 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.120
 there the dessert is finished the ideal one 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.500
 once it comes out of the oven leave 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.810
 cool your cream a little 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.629
 burned and then you caramelized 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.700
 okay then it's what it takes 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.700
 is that the cream is slightly lukewarm 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.250
 and the hot top here and there you 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.560
 have a little dessert you'll see a 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.129
 great talent and we will applaud you 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.129
 after all that
