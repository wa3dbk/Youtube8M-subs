 at the beginning human communication issue and that is quite limited 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.900
 long live the 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.120
 at the end of the 20th century 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.669
 he invented the computer 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.050
 but a young American computer scientist you decided to take advantage of it for 

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:24.049
 to found the biggest commercial empire of this end of century 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.199
 bibliobs was not a computer genius 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.960
 but he presented well 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.200
 he had patented a new operating system that was not working 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.130
 very well 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 but was very cheap 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.720
 an operating system 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.820
 that's what controls all the relationships between the machines the programs 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 and the user 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.390
 shortly before a bio five other computer scientists had also produced 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.700
 a new operating system 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.770
 the first is used or a mouse 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.810
 to click on icons to open windows 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 the first operating system usable per year 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 but these simple systems gave birth to function only on the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.550
 computers sold by its inventors owner 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.630
 while that of bibliobs between being installed on any machine 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.500
 also like a guigne a terrace principle of mouse and windows 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 it's his system that quickly attracted more and more consumers 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.960
 hence its range in addition to the builders of personal computers 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.020
 to equip their machines only with its system 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.740
 their users would have no choice but to buy exclusively 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.830
 software sold by the millions 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.210
 of their buddy the most that every two years out of new programs 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.720
 as well as a slightly less version to perform or its system 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.880
 operating 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 to ensure that consumers regularly buy their products 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.529
 but in the shadow of this business empire 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.769
 a community of computer scientists the other idealistic 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.019
 early take the free knowledge and work not to 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.089
 the development of free software that is free and stable number 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.399
 a beautiful day of 1992 a Finnish student of the world linux sport in basel 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.809
 to vantaa from these free software 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.459
 a new operating system 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.559
 and at the time we always kept secret it's source code 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.209
 the young computer specialist decided instead to share for free 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.129
 his contribution to the planet 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.859
 so was born the eight-minute system that developed very quickly 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:44.830
 thanks to the Internet 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.330
 and in front of the sworn enemy of the minims as the core of the fight for the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.289
 free software 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.589
 bibliobs it has always been the strongest in the art of commercial war 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.969
 the team today 96% of the computers on the planet 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.889
 it's not a single 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.259
 its main competitor holding 3% of the market 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.199
 but the same person does not even know who could type text navigate 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.890
 Internet 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.890
 thanks to software other than mining products 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.319
 yet the minutes system 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.319
 has gone beyond the stage where only computer scientists should be able to use 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.849
 today distributors offer prefabricated versions of the system 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:28.839
 minutes 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.879
 usable by municipal 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.959
 and allowing anyone that bibi or permanent products 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.019
 but in solidarity more reliable more resistant to the virus 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.899
 and for free 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.149
 for now the general public still prefers 2008 products 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.890
