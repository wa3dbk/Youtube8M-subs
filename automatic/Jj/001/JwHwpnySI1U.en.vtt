00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.190
 continuing the next program it 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.400
 call iphone you are also leaving 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.650
 the link in the video 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.769
 how the iphone works the iphone you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.940
 what he's going to do is replace the itunes 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.939
 everything a machine has with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.039
 jailbreak is recommended you are told and 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.189
 you have to keep in mind that never 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.840
 I recorded or did not open the iTunes when the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.660
 ipad is connected except that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.240
 want to update never open the ipad 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.220
 with the itunes because by the simple fact 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.839
 that the iTunes update the software 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.769
 the machine and the update is lost 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.600
 Hare 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.910
 I have simply lines to light 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 recorded on the computer because it's a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.680
 program that uses pp 25 and the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.230
 iphone vos 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.880
 we open the iphone box where the ipad already 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.580
 is connected to the machine 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.010
 we hope it has the same interface 45 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.300
 it's in Spanish and the iPhone is 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.130
 it does not record applications what it does is 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.130
 replace the example itunes here is 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.630
 let's go to the menu to manage applications 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.799
 I already have the applications that in the 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.420
 which we can record files 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.630
 now realizing when one has a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.369
 ipad or an apple machine 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.780
 When the iTunes comes in , the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.310
 applications where you can record 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.670
 files for example if I want to record a 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.030
 video you can use the abt player and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.000
 how it's called recorded the video or saved 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.979
 the video in the application and well what by 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.170
 reproduce from black but here 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.619
 example let's open the document that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.619
 It is the most used 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.620
 in these moments open it as it was and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.580
 these are all the files that I have 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.110
 on my ipad 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.290
 but now I'm going to record a file 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.230
 more so I just open the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.680
 Documents to go application 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.560
 I put copy to the device and look in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.980
 my documents any file that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.100
 want to record can be a pdf a power 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.160
 point a word whatever for example a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 Immunizations article a pdf 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.930
 selected here is crazy 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.020
 this project 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.290
 I just put it to open 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.350
 as a little company here is in an area 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.510
 of immunizations there is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.330
 and now when you open the ipad simply 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.800
 we will find it here for example 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.000
 as I mention bogota began horn 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.190
 to open everything that would come to be 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.670
 micros office for example now we want 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.560
 record a video 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.230
 I'm leaving installed in the machines 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.870
 in the bh player that is the most the market 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.640
 simply being all we can 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.940
 copy the device and if we start a 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940
 video 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.940
 for example I have a video 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.940
 a mp4 simply achieved 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.790
 as it weighs a little 150 less it took a 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.450
 little in recording the memory of life 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.450
 It was recorded 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.739
 it got worse and good we continue with 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.739
 we continue with that 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.099
 there he forgets 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.830
 now it's what you eat business for the pdf is 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.840
 the date for videos donkey 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.940
 dementia to serve to see different 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.590
 little things 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.470
 and here are all the applications to 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.520
 which can be recorded things 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.380
 to the camera 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.390
 to the camera we can add images 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.910
 we see images simply as we see it 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.910
 in the roll of the law simply 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.459
 that would be all well and good now 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.459
 example 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.360
 this is simply for the more 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.739
 applications you simply put this 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.660
 iphone application bo replaces what 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.160
 that comes in the itunes and the iphone box 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.650
 has never asked to update the ipad and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.390
 will ask for any kind of permission 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.850
 which is more advisable 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.110
 good once it is already managed it 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.880
 that gravel in the file simply 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.680
 I close them and from your ipad you can already 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.670
 open 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.670
 do not fire me this
