this<00:00:06.750> video<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.820> mining<00:00:08.820> my<00:00:09.349> apex<00:00:10.349> Neptune

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
this video is on mining my apex Neptune

this video is on mining my apex Neptune
controller<00:00:11.849> onto<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.570> board<00:00:14.240> we<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
controller onto the board we got the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.340 
controller onto the board we got the
brain

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
brain

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.040 
brain
we<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:18.150> display<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.340> energy<00:00:20.880> bar<00:00:21.119> we

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
we got the display got the energy bar we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.220 
we got the display got the energy bar we
also<00:00:22.230> got<00:00:22.710> ammo<00:00:23.100> mount<00:00:23.869> figure<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.019> gonna

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
also got ammo mount figure I'm gonna

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.700 
also got ammo mount figure I'm gonna
mount<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.980> power<00:00:26.279> strip<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:26.880> here

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
mount this this power strip right here

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.760 
mount this this power strip right here
so<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.779> there<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> one

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.790 

gonna<00:00:37.770> control<00:00:38.960> when<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.230> another<00:00:40.410> energy

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
gonna control when I get another energy

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.510 
gonna control when I get another energy
bars<00:00:40.980> gonna<00:00:41.219> control<00:00:41.550> both<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:43.190> Frank<00:00:44.190> tank

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
bars gonna control both the Frank tank

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.619 
bars gonna control both the Frank tank
and<00:00:46.280> my<00:00:47.280> main<00:00:47.820> display<00:00:49.309> well<00:00:50.539> sorry<00:00:51.539> about

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and my main display well sorry about

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.410 
and my main display well sorry about
that<00:00:52.940> camera's<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:53.969> working<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.780> good

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
that camera's not working very good

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.950 
that camera's not working very good
where's<00:00:57.420> camera's<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.020> working<00:00:58.170> good<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.800> all

right here's what I got so far I got one

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
right here's what I got so far I got one
energy<00:01:11.250> bar<00:01:11.780> no<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.729> got<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> apex<00:01:18.710> controller

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
energy bar no I got the apex controller

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.569 
energy bar no I got the apex controller
mounted<00:01:21.950> our<00:01:22.950> next<00:01:23.400> mounts<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.530> right<00:01:25.530> here

that mounted
I'll<00:02:08.910> let<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.269> space<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:11.610> there<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.180> I'll<00:02:12.420> get

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
I'll let the space in there so I'll get

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.900 
I'll let the space in there so I'll get
to<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.780> blog<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.650> need<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:16.610> okay<00:02:17.610> little
