00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 So welcome to the pc patch 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.780
 notes today from 21 06 2014 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.740
 we are talking about the champion today 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.020
 changes among others by nautilus brown 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.359
 jacks cale and michael and 6 we catch 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.460
 with nowtilus the only thing I contribute 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.140
 has changed that if he his 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.130
 passive on someone is doing now 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.579
 this circle timer dingens expires when 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.690
 he returns to his passive 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.960
 can use effects 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 at brown the wsl became the constantly 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.050
 put on pw and annoyed so in the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.110
 moment gives the wsp standby 15 to 25 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.700
 poor and maggy chriss is 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 instead of ten to twenty, I know 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.840
 not as it is live the change that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.789
 every patch with brown back and forth does not matter 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.219
 and percentage, there are ten to 16 but 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.400
 impossible kisses instead of 10 to 18 percent 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.750
 so hardly a few small earth 6 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.810
 the base hp is the 535 city 561 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.119
 the base hpv level is now 85 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.750
 98 the base amor is now 25 instead of 25 5 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.340
 and base but is now 3 per level 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 instead of 35 because a smaller larger earth 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.720
 at kay the empirical of her game 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 is now from 0.4 down to 0 2 then 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.820
 comes once to 6 because the wsb has it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.329
 five seconds cool then at 6 instead of 4 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.399
 but for each one for each piece 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.500
 even that she does not care that cool 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.630
 on our way down a second 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.659
 so now we come to the biggest change 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 and that costs the circle coesfeld 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 now ten times less so 45 and the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 slow now only lasts 15 seconds 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990
 instead of two seconds 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.770
 then the SP was the reason something 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 annoyed at the impact he makes now 40 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.800
 up to 120 damage instead of 40 to 40 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.690
 180 the explosion only makes it 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.730
 80 to 240 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.420
 instead of 80 to 280, however, it's loud 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.580
 explosion now for a second around 50 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 And the mahner costs are raw materials 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.920
 always 10 less so now 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.440
 60 to 100 instead of previously 70 to 110 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.720
 Commissar does that 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 percentage damage to nine to fifteen 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:44.040
 plus 0.04 show instead of 80 to 120 before 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.900
 damage or percentage in tooltip stands 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.430
 now that it does a maximum of 300 damage 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.000
 minions and monsters 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.470
 the range of oasis bell is now from 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.420
 Its going to cost 650 to 500 for that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.540
 meanwhile only 75 men 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.940
 instead of 75 to 95 and he does not like 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.220
 always cool 13 seconds ago 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.250
 now 12 at level 1 and only eight 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.480
 seconds kohler and on level 5 now 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.150
 but comes the most important 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 because if Michael now a multi 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.080
 activated because it surrounds him and moves 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.630
 with him is not cool 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.950
 cool or because you have the same times a 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.950
 Round the game 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.450
 so friends who should remember that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.069
 again, only the pp was and the changes 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.030
 not to 100 percent have to occur 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.500
 but write me please in the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.750
 comments what you think of the channels 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.909
 Mainly keep the motto change 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.730
 because I'm the extremely interesting and 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.989
 exciting also find can you now 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.579
 I do not know anywhere on the left 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.290
 can you do it again if you have it 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.879
 still does not know that warwick 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.920
 look at rework 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.200
 in the middle the new spot is troge 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.410
 meter with mr of blood horch and peep 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.079
 lp and tlp gaming and if ever 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.060
 you can still be bronze or silver gold 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.310
 you too with you again the providers 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.019
 look 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.470
 otherwise what about me I'm out to 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.470
