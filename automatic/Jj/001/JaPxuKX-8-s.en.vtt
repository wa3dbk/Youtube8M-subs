00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
next picture I just you know some

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.950 
next picture I just you know some
footage<00:00:43.260> from<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> moon<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.780> we<00:00:45.780> can

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
footage from the moon but we can

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
footage from the moon but we can
actually<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.530> where<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> claim<00:00:47.250> wars<00:00:47.489> are

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
actually see where the claim wars are

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually see where the claim wars are
supposed<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.239> there's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> helmet<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
supposed to be there's a helmet so you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
supposed to be there's a helmet so you
would<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.649> choose<00:00:52.890> if

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
would I think you can actually choose if

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.770 
would I think you can actually choose if
you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.090> helmet<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.570> take<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you want to put your helmet or take it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.580 
you want to put your helmet or take it
off<00:00:55.610> your<00:00:56.610> vision<00:00:57.120> will<00:00:57.360> probably<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
off your vision will probably be like a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.390 
off your vision will probably be like a
little<00:00:59.489> not<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.719> blurry<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:03.140> less

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
little not not blurry but a little less

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
little not not blurry but a little less
how<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.549> say<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.140> can't<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
how do you say you go you can't you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
how do you say you go you can't you
can't<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> lot<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> helmet<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.210> as

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
can't see a lot with the helmet on as

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.000 
can't see a lot with the helmet on as
you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.350> top<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.740> that

picture<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.400> starting<00:01:29.790> room<00:01:29.970> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
picture this is a the starting room this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.030 
picture this is a the starting room this
is<00:01:30.509> how<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.590> how<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
is how this is just how it's going to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.469 
is how this is just how it's going to
look<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:33.079> pretty<00:01:34.079> pretty<00:01:34.680> big<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.640> I'm

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
look like pretty pretty big actually I'm

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
look like pretty pretty big actually I'm
pretty<00:01:37.020> sure<00:01:37.320> there's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.650> suit<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
pretty sure there's a suit in there I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.899 
pretty sure there's a suit in there I
think<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.570> saw<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:41.060> yeah<00:01:42.060> guys<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
think I saw it and yeah guys that's it

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
think I saw it and yeah guys that's it
the<00:01:44.909> new<00:01:45.060> uh<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> grad<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the new uh it's like a grad this is a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
the new uh it's like a grad this is a
new<00:01:46.950> weapon<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> grenade<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.450> think

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
new weapon it's like a grenade I think

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.840 
new weapon it's like a grenade I think
it's<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> quantum<00:01:49.920> entanglement<00:01:50.340> device<00:01:50.490> i'm

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's the quantum entanglement device i'm

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's the quantum entanglement device i'm
not<00:01:51.060> sure<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.799> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.280> video<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:53.909> do

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
not sure but in the video what they do

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.330 
not sure but in the video what they do
is<00:01:54.240> they<00:01:54.390> throw<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.560> acts<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
is they throw it down and it acts like a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
is they throw it down and it acts like a
musket<00:01:57.000> doll<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.329> i'm<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.570> sure<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.840> they

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
musket doll but i'm not sure if they

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
musket doll but i'm not sure if they
threw<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> grenade<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.729> multiplied

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
threw a grenade and it just multiplied

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.090 
threw a grenade and it just multiplied
the<00:02:00.450> grenade<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> that's<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.270> sea<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.320> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the grenade so that's the sea and just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.940 
the grenade so that's the sea and just
kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> back<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.790> first<00:02:06.090> picture<00:02:06.420> guys

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
kind of back on the first picture guys
