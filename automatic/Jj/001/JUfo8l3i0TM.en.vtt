00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.690
 Bad luck for newcomers Reason Here comes the question of today 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.119
 we have a French bulldog kicking up a reprimand two years ago 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.579
 very sick and we can not properly educate him 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.909
 after a great Europeans everything is back in the lot the commands seated seat 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.680
 Often one won here ban from Lyon 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.350
 Space was kept in the apartment but it is not the exterior facade 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.550
 interesting festive treats and favorite toys are uninteresting 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.900
 From Kampala worst it is with his dog he betrays completely 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.310
 then already considered 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.630
 Berlin in a dog school to go 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.110
 yes clearly 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.510
 you should definitely in this case 2 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.220
 and save the crash 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.580
 and not only that he if the dog prevents but clearly 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 in Nantes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.180
 if there are more exercises then more exercise will be more training 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.560
 that means 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.950
 because they have to go out with him a lot and so many of the big ones are enough 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.460
 now where it works is okay 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 go outside and out there and it really has to be outside 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.020
 should be normal for the dog number at the beginning, of course, super and look around 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.120
 Do everything and start on dogs alone 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.540
 but we tend to spend a lot of time outside, then went to two 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.540
 Hours because then the semifinals 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 the wounds by also nothing new anymore hair in his environment 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.200
 that would be the right time and then 11% starts with the toy 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.870
 to come and then lie with him and then he gradually gets used to it 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.440
 that in the third and outside actually percent obedience finish no 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.350
 Difference is 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.680
 even if outside in winter are expected 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.320
 because you have to go into it from one thing that is clear with the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 Hundeschule that's 100 the one way 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.270
 to get used to it 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.430
 to learn to listen in the presence of other dogs 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.840
 and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.540
 to pay attention to the sign and just a dog school and the other dogs 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.350
 from 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.510
 how we distract now but if great ways to try things 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.500
 Ronald that the passers-by looking away makes the disadvantage of no school 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.850
 there for that one just 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.210
 busy with music so we quietly make it possible for users 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.050
 They add a lot to the large boardroom in the young school 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.099
 the normal process is actually percent 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.859
 that maintenance learns that 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.639
 that at home 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.029
 best made his living environment 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.029
 Do the percent also at some point in the dog school 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.300
 Rolf's incoming mails the third step 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.460
 that's out in the open in the wild, so to speak 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.950
 then finally percent works so it is a normal process that it too 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.130
 Home works best only after that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.130
 in the other difficult places the next difficult one 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.539
 until then those without school so who logically now after 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:47.189
 the SV hat off 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.189
 to try it somewhere else 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.159
 The investigator is 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.069
 on 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.909
 a small
