00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
station that when we took that sidebar

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.100 
station that when we took that sidebar
trip<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.180> find<00:01:27.390> feeding

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
trip to see if we could find feeding

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.249 
trip to see if we could find feeding
that<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.610> different<00:01:29.790> behavior<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:31.079> got

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that was very different behavior we got

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.140 
that was very different behavior we got
those<00:01:31.439> nice<00:01:31.680> man<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.189> feeding<00:01:32.579> shots<00:01:32.820> would

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
those nice man or a feeding shots would

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
those nice man or a feeding shots would
they<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> loop-d-loop<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.710> actually

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they do the loop-d-loop they actually

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
they do the loop-d-loop they actually
drive<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.939> mice<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
drive all the little mice it's up to the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
drive all the little mice it's up to the
surface<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.430> Luke<00:01:38.670> yeah

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
surface and then they they Luke yeah

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.600 
surface and then they they Luke yeah
right<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.299> front<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.840> scoop<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.229> up

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
right in front of them and scoop them up

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
right in front of them and scoop them up
absolutely<00:01:41.610> my<00:01:42.090> sense<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:44.189> know

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
absolutely my sense was that you know

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.679 
absolutely my sense was that you know
when<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.670> doing<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.030> loop-de-loop

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
when they're doing that loop-de-loop

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.060 
when they're doing that loop-de-loop
that<00:01:47.509> they're<00:01:48.509> they're<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.170> optimizing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that they're they're kind of optimizing

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
an area where they're working you know

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
an area where they're working you know

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and and what what a better wave in if

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
and and what what a better wave in if
you're<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> hot<00:01:54.780> spot<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.140> feeding<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you're on a hot spot for feeding and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.679 
you're on a hot spot for feeding and
just<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> keep<00:01:56.579> looping<00:01:56.820> around<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.509> mean

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
just to keep looping around I mean

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.270 
just to keep looping around I mean
that's<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.049> would<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> best<00:01:58.829> way<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> do

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that's that would be the best way to do

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520 
that's that would be the best way to do
it<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> they<00:02:00.090> figured<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it and they figured out they got it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
it and they figured out they got it
figured<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.509> their

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
figured out I think that they use their

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.289 
figured out I think that they use their
fins<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> corral<00:02:04.950> those<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.090> mice

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
fins to kind of corral those little mice

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.270 
fins to kind of corral those little mice
it's<00:02:06.570> those<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.020> shrimp<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:08.129> they

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it's those little shrimp and then they

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.460 
it's those little shrimp and then they
come<00:02:08.520> through<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.289> congregation<00:02:10.289> with

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
come through that congregation with

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.530 
come through that congregation with
their<00:02:10.679> mandibles<00:02:11.280> all<00:02:11.610> open<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.330> may

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
their mandibles all open like this may

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.020 
their mandibles all open like this may
scoop

scoop

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.300

and<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.570> can<00:02:13.750> see<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.260> license<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:14.980> water

and you can see the license in the water

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.810 
and you can see the license in the water
so<00:02:16.090> if<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.450> go<00:02:17.200> hang<00:02:17.560> out<00:02:17.770> where<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.430> mices

they<00:05:43.250> make<00:05:43.460> an<00:05:43.610> impression<00:05:44.210> on<00:05:44.420> all<00:05:44.750> presents

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.960 

it<00:06:21.050> looked<00:06:21.350> to<00:06:21.440> me<00:06:21.650> like<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:22.010> mobilis<00:06:22.640> were

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
it looked to me like the mobilis were

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.720 
it looked to me like the mobilis were
actually<00:06:23.690> working<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:24.290> bait<00:06:24.470> but<00:06:25.400> I<00:06:25.430> don't

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
actually working the bait but I don't

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.400 
actually working the bait but I don't
ever<00:06:25.910> remember<00:06:26.030> seeing<00:06:26.330> them<00:06:26.690> actually<00:06:27.140> get

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
ever remember seeing them actually get

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.020 
ever remember seeing them actually get
any<00:06:27.620> of<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.740> bait<00:06:27.950> they<00:06:28.550> must<00:06:28.760> have<00:06:28.880> been

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
any of the bait they must have been

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.110 
any of the bait they must have been
that's<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:29.900> me<00:06:30.020> a<00:06:30.050> mystery<00:06:30.500> to<00:06:30.850> obviously<00:06:31.850> the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
that's to me a mystery to obviously the

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.230 
that's to me a mystery to obviously the
mobile<00:06:32.420> is<00:06:32.570> were<00:06:32.870> right<00:06:33.770> in<00:06:34.100> the<00:06:34.280> action<00:06:34.460> with

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
mobile is were right in the action with

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.570 
mobile is were right in the action with
these<00:06:35.420> baitfish<00:06:35.690> when<00:06:36.470> they<00:06:36.650> were<00:06:36.710> swarming

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
these baitfish when they were swarming

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.120 
these baitfish when they were swarming
around<00:06:37.790> and<00:06:38.390> it<00:06:39.200> seemed<00:06:39.560> like<00:06:39.800> when<00:06:39.980> the

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
around and it seemed like when the

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.510 
around and it seemed like when the
mobile<00:06:40.460> was<00:06:40.640> came<00:06:41.030> through<00:06:41.620> that<00:06:42.620> they<00:06:42.920> were

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
mobile was came through that they were

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.960 
mobile was came through that they were
really<00:06:43.820> clearing<00:06:44.210> out<00:06:44.860> one<00:06:45.860> shot<00:06:46.430> I<00:06:46.460> recall

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
really clearing out one shot I recall

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.120 
really clearing out one shot I recall
the<00:06:47.330> mobile<00:06:47.780> life<00:06:47.930> just<00:06:48.320> came<00:06:48.500> through<00:06:48.530> the

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
the mobile life just came through the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.370 
the mobile life just came through the
baitfish<00:06:49.730> and<00:06:50.030> it<00:06:50.390> just<00:06:50.570> opened<00:06:50.990> up<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.170> big

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
baitfish and it just opened up a big

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.370 
baitfish and it just opened up a big
hole<00:06:51.640> and<00:06:52.640> we<00:06:53.540> spent<00:06:53.840> a<00:06:53.900> whole<00:06:54.020> afternoon

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380
