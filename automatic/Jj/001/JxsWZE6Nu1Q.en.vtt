 is a fight with a lot in that regard 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.299
 experience yes but not at the level of 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.570
 where I sat on 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.399
 the lame longer that clear 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.369
 and just like his first official 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.220
 competition on December 11, 1983 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.410

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.040
 just really 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.090
 and there are just many more opportunities like that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.850
 it goes well 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.980
 it's a trial but as summer 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.959
 I hear you just see how much is coming 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.069
 and doing that might go a long way 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.380
 to be 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.340

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.049

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.750
