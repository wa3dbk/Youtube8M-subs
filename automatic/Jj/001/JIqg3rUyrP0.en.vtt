00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.780
 so in this video we will look at you 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:21.350
 disassembly and assembly and repair of the camera 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:21.350
 vigilant such apparatus upper 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 unscrew the 4 screws facing while he 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:58.540
 also not interesting surrounded side and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:01:01.140
 we look that we have an instructor here 2 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.140
 stupor 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.900
 so 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:26.790
 The curtains are not in the best condition. 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:32.110
 dried out 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:39.150
 they need to be changed and the vidal got a piece 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 film that she twisted I broke away 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.229
 a piece of curtain up 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 2 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:00.670
 so we figured it out here too 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:12.150
 then everything in the original should be glued 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:18.459
 and so it should be visible 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:22.680
 drying out burst tires on them here 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:28.930
 the curtains are made by this machine they are already 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:37.930
 still they are oak it we will have 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:41.250
 change to make what could all 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.250
 it's a question of me doing 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:57.270
 right now, let's see you do not come in handy 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:05.790
 the only thing I ask you to note 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:05.790
 where can such a different level 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:24.260
 that is to confuse them practically 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:24.260
 impossible so send our magic 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:37.700
 concerns smog also send here 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:41.580
 the drum still touches 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:51.360
 access opened we removed gears not all 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:59.330
 naturally so insert the shutter on 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.330
 place in the last third of the screw 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.160
 how much do we have 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:32.780
 we enter and so together everything will work 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:43.940
 so on now we will 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.940
 embed rose 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:58.099
 covers why I put no place 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:09.110
 potatoes 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:09.110
 our potatoes put the lid 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.970
 St. level is so set the lens 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:30.599
 it remained literally lucky to 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:35.669
 memory and need to work about 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:39.050
 alignment I have already said I will talk about 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.050
 this later 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.240
 repair of the spy apparatus 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.240
 we will finish
