this is Bruce I'm back here for the

this is Bruce I'm back here for the
December<00:00:17.539> newsletter<00:00:18.050> my<00:00:18.380> how<00:00:18.830> time<00:00:19.190> is

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
December newsletter my how time is

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.000 
December newsletter my how time is
flying<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:19.940> so<00:00:20.360> is<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.660> evolution<00:00:21.199> as<00:00:21.410> we

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
flying and so is the evolution as we

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.800 
flying and so is the evolution as we
keep<00:00:22.160> our<00:00:22.340> eyes<00:00:22.490> open<00:00:22.730> we<00:00:23.030> see<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.330> world<00:00:23.540> is

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
keep our eyes open we see the world is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.020 
keep our eyes open we see the world is
in<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.140> state<00:00:24.770> of<00:00:24.800> upheaval<00:00:25.190> and<00:00:25.550> all<00:00:25.700> of<00:00:25.880> this

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
in a state of upheaval and all of this

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.720 
in a state of upheaval and all of this
is<00:00:26.300> really<00:00:26.540> a<00:00:26.900> preparation<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:28.010> chaos<00:00:28.430> that

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
is really a preparation a chaos that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.790 
is really a preparation a chaos that
precedes<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:29.480> formation<00:00:30.170> of<00:00:30.260> a<00:00:30.380> new<00:00:30.530> world

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
precedes the formation of a new world

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.770 
precedes the formation of a new world
and<00:00:31.130> this<00:00:31.790> world<00:00:32.029> that<00:00:32.239> we're<00:00:32.360> talking<00:00:32.540> about

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
and this world that we're talking about

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.900 
and this world that we're talking about
is<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.140> one<00:00:33.260> I've<00:00:33.469> written<00:00:34.100> about<00:00:34.430> with<00:00:34.640> Steve

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
is the one I've written about with Steve

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.270 
is the one I've written about with Steve
and<00:00:35.180> spontaneous<00:00:35.780> evolution<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.590> it's<00:00:37.100> very

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
and spontaneous evolution and it's very

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.530 
and spontaneous evolution and it's very
interesting<00:00:37.670> because<00:00:37.910> we<00:00:38.180> talk<00:00:38.360> about

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
interesting because we talk about

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.030 
interesting because we talk about
evolution<00:00:38.780> as<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.380> coming<00:00:39.590> together<00:00:39.800> of

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
evolution as the coming together of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.400 
evolution as the coming together of
individual<00:00:40.670> units<00:00:40.910> coming<00:00:41.780> together<00:00:41.900> to<00:00:42.230> form

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
individual units coming together to form

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.140 
individual units coming together to form
community<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.250> this<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.490> a<00:00:43.610> pattern<00:00:43.910> of

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
community and this is a pattern of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.990 
community and this is a pattern of
evolution<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:44.989> it's<00:00:45.440> interesting<00:00:45.739> because

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
evolution and it's interesting because

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.729 
evolution and it's interesting because
even<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.180> motto<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.750> United<00:00:48.140> States<00:00:48.170> e

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
even the motto of the United States e

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.760 
even the motto of the United States e
pluribus<00:00:49.310> unum<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.690> says<00:00:50.899> from<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.530> many

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
pluribus unum and it says from the many

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.610 
pluribus unum and it says from the many
come<00:00:52.250> one<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.940> this<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.540> exactly<00:00:54.170> what<00:00:54.470> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
come one and this is exactly what the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.380 
come one and this is exactly what the
evolution<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.280> whole<00:00:55.430> world<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:56.060> about<00:00:56.329> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
evolution of the whole world is about to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.020 
evolution of the whole world is about to
experience<00:00:57.200> and<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.010> really<00:00:58.430> part<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
experience and it's really part of the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.479 
experience and it's really part of the
whole<00:00:59.059> us<00:00:59.720> motto<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.500> credo<00:01:00.770> of<00:01:01.100> what<00:01:01.370> our

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
whole us motto and the credo of what our

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.790 
whole us motto and the credo of what our
country<00:01:01.790> was<00:01:01.910> built<00:01:01.940> on<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.630> so<00:01:03.380> what<00:01:03.590> we're

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
country was built on and so what we're

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.859 
country was built on and so what we're
seeing<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:04.369> evolution<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.119> chaos<00:01:05.570> start

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
seeing this evolution in chaos start

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.990 
seeing this evolution in chaos start
we're<00:01:06.079> also<00:01:06.259> seeing<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.860> action<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.490> Occupy

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
we're also seeing the action of Occupy

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.450 
we're also seeing the action of Occupy
Wall<00:01:08.270> Street<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.619> visual

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
Wall Street this is a visual

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.399 
Wall Street this is a visual
representation<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.870> change<00:01:12.170> in

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
representation of the change in

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.750 
representation of the change in
evolution<00:01:12.920> that's<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:13.250> front<00:01:13.400> of<00:01:13.549> us<00:01:13.670> right

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
evolution that's in front of us right

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.480 
evolution that's in front of us right
now<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.450> why<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.560> important<00:01:16.040> as<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:16.310> is

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
now and why this is important as this is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.700 
now and why this is important as this is
people<00:01:17.090> standing<00:01:17.540> up<00:01:17.690> for<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:17.990> simple<00:01:18.409> reality

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
people standing up for a simple reality

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.340 
people standing up for a simple reality
the<00:01:19.520> world<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:19.970> not<00:01:20.090> sustainable<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.200> no

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
the world is not sustainable it is no

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.950 
the world is not sustainable it is no
longer<00:01:21.740> supporting<00:01:22.280> us<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.700> we<00:01:23.390> must<00:01:23.659> make<00:01:23.930> a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
longer supporting us and we must make a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.740 
longer supporting us and we must make a
change<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.560> our<00:01:24.650> behavior<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.760> take<00:01:26.030> us<00:01:26.210> out<00:01:26.450> of

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
change in our behavior to take us out of

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.050 
change in our behavior to take us out of
an<00:01:26.960> inevitable<00:01:27.619> extinction<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.400> into<00:01:29.030> a

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
an inevitable extinction and into a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.539 
an inevitable extinction and into a
world<00:01:29.270> we<00:01:29.510> can<00:01:29.659> thrive<00:01:29.930> into<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.369> very

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
world we can thrive into and it's very

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.399 
world we can thrive into and it's very
interested<00:01:32.119> because<00:01:32.210> at<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.810> time<00:01:33.080> what<00:01:33.320> is

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
interested because at this time what is

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.200 
interested because at this time what is
Occupy<00:01:33.860> Wall<00:01:34.040> Street<00:01:34.100> all<00:01:34.520> about<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.060> really

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
Occupy Wall Street all about it's really

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.060 
Occupy Wall Street all about it's really
talking<00:01:35.720> about<00:01:35.750> how<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.140> moneyed<00:01:36.470> interests

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
talking about how the moneyed interests

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.190 
talking about how the moneyed interests
are<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.280> corporate<00:01:37.729> presence<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.689> actually

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
are the corporate presence is actually

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.750 
are the corporate presence is actually
changing<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.950> course<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.400> human<00:01:40.640> evolution

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
changing the course of human evolution

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.359 
changing the course of human evolution
and<00:01:41.450> why<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.229> really<00:01:42.619> want<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.860> bring<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.040> up

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
and why I really want to bring this up

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.130 
and why I really want to bring this up
is<00:01:43.549> because<00:01:43.580> rather<00:01:44.210> than<00:01:44.450> talking<00:01:44.840> about<00:01:44.900> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
is because rather than talking about the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.560 
is because rather than talking about the
corporate<00:01:45.560> presence<00:01:46.040> we<00:01:46.700> are<00:01:46.729> really<00:01:47.299> talking

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
corporate presence we are really talking

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.170 
corporate presence we are really talking
in<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.900> political<00:01:48.320> arena<00:01:48.500> about<00:01:48.920> whether<00:01:49.909> there

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
in a political arena about whether there

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.429 
in a political arena about whether there
should<00:01:50.299> be<00:01:50.360> more<00:01:50.659> government<00:01:51.170> or<00:01:51.259> less

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
should be more government or less

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.859 
should be more government or less
government<00:01:51.979> one<00:01:52.729> side<00:01:53.000> says<00:01:53.299> government<00:01:53.810> is

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
government one side says government is

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.420
