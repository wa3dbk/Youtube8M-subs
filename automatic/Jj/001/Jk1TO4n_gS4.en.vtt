00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.830
 channel my name is inna 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.629
 today girls show you my 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.639
 small purchases lately 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.440
 I recently ended two-phase 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.210
 clarins facial serum 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 and I decided to find myself something else on 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 replacement because there I was not impressed 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 it seemed to me that after half 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.789
 use she even stopped even 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.010
 moisturize my face and a little bit when 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.590
 film went to bed but I do not know something 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 here at all did not go whether the skin somehow 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.240
 does not react to him at all know connected 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.070
 In general, I went to the river and gosh already with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 specific purpose to buy at all 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.320
 friend in the moat serum and saw on 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.070
 booth a remarkable set of such 2 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.020
 1 this is from to dore such here are two means 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 otherwise there is slag serum 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.690
 Makeup Remover 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.260
 girls let's go straight to the shaft today 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.090
 this i will say well she removes makeup 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.969
 no claims to her no she does not dry 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 skin now peak eyes only minus 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.210
 very economical that's why taking it to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 full version I would not 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 here is girl serum me very 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 pleasantly surprised she certainly would not 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.080
 some super some properties to do with 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 she just moisturizes her skin 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.909
 can be used as a stand alone 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.680
 it is quite economical it is easy for me 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.439
 like a little face so straight 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.540
 engorged and the morning after the tree is not like 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.960
 elastic would have those girls 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 who just want moisturizing and if 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.869
 for example you for example up to 32 well maximum 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.210
 then went to stand 6 and took it myself 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.020
 this one is a contour cream around 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 eye 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.420
 benefiance 24 hours he goes as anti anti 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.610
 such an age 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.640
 fights crest with wrinkles fights 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.640
 for example, with the fact that it does not give the skin to write 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.009
 make it more elastic but very all that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.689
 I wanted from cream and he is very fat 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.000
 big plus that seems to me this 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.100
 enough wand for a long time that he thought 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 so economical it seems to me very much that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.380
 I don’t use it at all though almost 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.060
 on it there will be girls soon i'm 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 I can advise this cream 100% 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.250
 sure yes he stands 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.379
 water of course yes but if there is a gain 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.150
 discount card is fully justified 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.160
 their price can be one hundred percent say 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.410
 after a month of use here 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 here here on this eye when I'm all 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.390
 I wore makeup in a corner 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.069
 you know such as arrows 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.750
 wrinkle so to speak not all the time 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.640
 as it was straining to me it seemed that 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.580
 I would like to feed her with a cream 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.489
 so that she smoothed out in general not 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.830
 believe her tfat tattoo is simply no branch 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.239
 I advise you to advise 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.370
 look if you are looking for something like that 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.480
 like a day already i took myself 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.560
 sensibio 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.230
 a and a 5 arman let's get it show 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.930
 probably already in that cream it is very light 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.299
 great for the day he also 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.709
 struggling with some like this 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.980
 fill these here if some 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.480
 truths bummer this wrinkles he them 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.450
 smoothes and makes the skin also elastic 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.519
 but than 100 reviews on it already did 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.489
 I love very light for the summer like 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.709
 super further two facials very 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.900
 I also heard a lot of reviews from natura 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.170
 siberica instant mask it 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.870
 compare as an analog mask from by and he 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.569
 also instantly they have it from such in 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.609
 series and it goes for all skin types 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.010
 meaning she brings your face 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.930
 exactly in such good condition after 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.690
 the first of its application can say that 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.560
 there is something rather elegant but for the price 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.930
 she i don't know she like that face 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.690
 pulls up or new mask for me 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.180
 this bath Agafya rest calm on 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.739
 cornflower water 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.230
 blue clay here contains oatmeal 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.940
 cornflower blue water is generally very 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.430
 many praise such masks I had 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.590
 tar good at all so cleaned 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.359
 sometimes here it doesn't seem anymore yet 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.670
 the role to play is exactly what the shell and 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.560
 clay composed of blue clay even if in 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.989
 pure form just buy for 15-20 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.569
 rubles in the pharmacy it will also be cool 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.430
 work even 3 x 3 shampoo loss two of 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.790
 I have already had this new one here 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.230
 you told me about it and I had 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.770
 im not very good impressions i'm not 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.360
 I know 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.070
 so there is nothing like your own 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.459
 does not function even as dry 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.220
 shampoo 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.190
 so I didn’t like it for me 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.290
 the worst is like these two 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.100
 new and i'll tell you wanna say that they 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.350
 even 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.330
 Big liked than the original 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.210
 because this is exactly this juicy 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.970
 cheeky aroma with cherry is very cool 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.460
 cleans hair and they are straight 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.650
 volumetric it gets you much better and 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.510
 Here again, I repeat those that I 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.530
 have here is such a scent of first 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.110
 spring flowers 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.300
 they are the same to me in their own way 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.550
 properties if for example compare again 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.650
 I repeat with the original and there is fresh 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.770
 which until freshness so green 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.030
 they are even more 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.270
 and sprayed them here this here white 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.400
 it is the powder itself that takes longer 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.130
 would distribute the hair knead here 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.900
 it's all here it is polish and somehow wrong 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.090
 strongly that expressed I do not know that is 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.340
 I literally straighten a little and hair 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.290
 we are very clean looking super 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.300
 Of course do not use often and not somewhere 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.210
 once a week I advise you well two 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.210
 maximum not more than pharmacy creams 1 this 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.400
 bioderma sebium hydra really liked 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.170
 how even well-hydrates can be such an 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.150
 the rocks are heavy it feels like he is 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.350
 as if created by a film on the face 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:36.080
 but he had long absorbed so well, it is necessary to 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.230
 try and you are a guitar optimal for its victim 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.610

 oils in contrast here it is 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.990

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.580
 putrov it is of course he does not struggle with 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.000
 black dots just good very
