00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.610
 we are here in england and we drive 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:21.180
 a Russian swim because of it 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:23.500
 Rains after my professional 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.290
 night pressure I look at me 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.890
 the interior of that much steel in it 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:34.059
 and bakelit around a lot of clay very much 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.129
 very premium so a cannon of course 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.289
 does not even exist in porsche im 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.289
 Schoental beautiful rims 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.510
 varnish also made very nice with 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.920
 These promotional decors are very racing moderately 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.690
 I like the entry is a 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.460
 I have to say a bit high 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.900
 So you sit high but the entry 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.620
 is also high and i have a ladder 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.550
 second hand 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.190
 to drive a bit, well 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.870
 I am here 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.610
 on invitation from universe but that has 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.070
 no influence on mine 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.270
 Reporting completely independent though 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:21.200
 please buy the dvd everyone 3 ok thanks good 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.930
 further in the text of the 21 is what we 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.380
 Weapons fund a driver fat 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.509
 call 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.440
 that means he has only vehicle 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.390
 the looking class a 120 mm howitzer 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.840
 the grenades about 15 kilometers 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.119
 Far shoots top feature I could 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.790
 not try it because I have no 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.710
 but grenades had it but will be fine 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.190
 his 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.540
 the 21 has a sporty 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.300
 it's hand-geared two gears 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.590
 unfortunately that is a bit hakelig there 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.640
 had to get the the man as help 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.020
 to insert the gear 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.350
 a clutch and then has two levers 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.810
 with which one controls the differential 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.340
 You can then create so brake as 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.940
 differential and then it works 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 torque on the other chain 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.739
 actually such a standard steering a lot 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.220
 right now so here a bit of gas 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.500
 give 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.450
 great engine great engine great sound 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.450
 also here from the eight-cylinder and 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.460
 then it works 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.270
 Who speaks softly of steering then 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.350
 sporty directly 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.700
 beautiful from the beginning caught the best 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.990
 Of course, this engine is 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.380
 this is a V8 turbodiesel has really great 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.230
 300 ps 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.210
 but as it is so common for the diesel 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.640
 It is not so important that he is 300 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.940
 ps has but he has mainly 1080 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.520
 newtonmeter at 1400 rpm and the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.420
 had 14 8 liters displacement 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.860
 that's exactly the design we German 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.450
 always wished us the most 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.890
 every one of our car and of course on 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.890
 Most of course we are looking for one 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.380
 always has torque and on the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.830
 power up comes out not synonymous 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.240
 so on 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.490
 he only drives 60 or so 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.440
 is also enough so I mean who 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.730
 had to drive faster nowadays than 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:37.160
 60 that only pollutes the environment 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:41.770
 special feature is the special feature on 21 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.770
 that lightweight is this vehicle 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.190
 weighs only 18 tons and is like that 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.320
 easy that it even floats on water 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:57.320
 the industry does not do that for her 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.420
 and with the kitten then sloshs through 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.220
 water and somehow creates one 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.560
 half knot or should you can 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.330
 go through the water so if 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.730
 on the way to work a puddle 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:13.550
 then you are in good hands with it 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.720
 the guy said in the water that 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.000
 Driving is not special 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.970
 collapse of this fucking scary me 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.890
 do not translate it perfectly 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.050
 it says in German German 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.720
 journalism fucking scary not quite 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.530
 perfect well here I have unfortunately 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.100
 method 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.350
 But he also sees the advantage of 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.010
 chains namely you can easily 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.270
 go through 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.720
 He also said it is not that bad 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.800
 when I drive against the tree 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.330
 because if I drive against a wall 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.060
 Then the tree gives way to very beautiful 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.590
 lightweight uncomplicated way of driving me 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.970
 just imagine this in the city 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.220
 in Stuttgart I think I would 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.220
 somehow so curiously easy to cross 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.420
 i have a criticism namely i would have 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.760
 like a windshield 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.680
 I have a pair of glasses on and how 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.600
 I was so eingesaut I had them 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.880
 then give the colleague because I have nothing 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.800
 seen more 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.330
 and if you give the glasses but then 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.730
 you get the dirt directly into the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.370
 eat so I would be there 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.010
 repairs require a 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.490
 windshield 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.490
 otherwise I have to say 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.380
 best I've ever driven 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.340
 also nice quiet many thanks universe 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.340
 Thank you 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.389
 also
