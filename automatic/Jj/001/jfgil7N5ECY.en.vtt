really<00:01:52.429> but<00:01:52.700> yeah<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.910> think<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.300> was<00:01:53.360> always

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
really but yeah I think it was always

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.969 
really but yeah I think it was always
kind<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.800> guitar<00:01:55.640> music<00:01:56.000> others<00:01:56.619> laser<00:01:57.619> for<00:01:57.860> I

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
kind of guitar music others laser for I

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:19.890 
kind of guitar music others laser for I
like<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.399> mattes

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.420 

we<00:02:20.900> did<00:02:21.319> everything<00:02:21.409> quite<00:02:21.799> quickly<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
we did everything quite quickly for the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.369 
we did everything quite quickly for the
EPS<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:23.060> think<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.299> longest<00:02:23.569> time<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:23.930> spent<00:02:24.200> on

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
EPS I think the longest time we spent on

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.309 
EPS I think the longest time we spent on
an<00:02:24.920> EP<00:02:25.340> was<00:02:25.549> like<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.849> week<00:02:26.120> or<00:02:26.329> four<00:02:26.840> days<00:02:27.079> for

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
what's hard to say because we've only

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.509

hard<00:03:19.639> to<00:03:19.790> say<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.329> I'm<00:03:20.480> sure<00:03:20.750> going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
hard to say but I'm sure going to a

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.539 
hard to say but I'm sure going to a
lovely<00:03:23.049> different<00:03:24.049> place<00:03:24.260> would<00:03:24.979> be<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.340> nice

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
lovely different place would be a nice

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:47.830 
lovely different place would be a nice
way<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.790> write

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.350 

they're<00:03:48.840> all<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.310> different<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.299> I
