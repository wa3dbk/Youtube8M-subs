00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.210
 let's draw chuck and this character 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.610
 of horror movie then 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.230
 Let's start the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.250
 is going to be your hair 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.529
 let's do a pretty hairstyle 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.779
 we have so to speak since it has then 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.210
 the hair on the face not but here 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.570
 has more 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.090
 and here we are going to make the face 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.160
 / something like that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.840
 we continue making your hair but now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.840
 you see the top 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.300
 fringes 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.850
 it is here the same thing we will continue 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.900
 doing here has a hairstyle like that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.310
 pretty crazy 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.170
 seen something like that 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.700
 now let's draw your eyes 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.770
 then we are going to do 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.770
 more good so ovals 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.060
 they are not so round and well as 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.550
 lying down then we will draw the eyebrows 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 something like that 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.810
 making a bit of a bad face is the same 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.780
 with this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.750
 little wrinkled our doll not for 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.590
 I got my nose 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.590
 to the mouth 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.530
 let's do it 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.530
 making a pretty mouth 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.830
 pretty bad not our character by 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.830
 here would have through two wrinkles 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.190
 and the eye around here we do better 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.350
 We'll paint 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.070
 over here is in our character has 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.070
 a scar 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.940
 until they were caught there and everything was not 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.490
 would drop a mark here in the mouth 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.090
 and ready the face 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.950
 now let's draw these pants 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.100
 that were used in those times as well 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.470
 with braces and all 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 more or less we make the straight line here 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.500
 and here we will do the tugs 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.740
 now we are going to 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.610
 more or less comes with this curve 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.610
 with heels 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.200
 and we are going to go down like this 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.510
 and here the same thing a little more open 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.510
 do not 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.549
 then by here 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.930
 let's do the separation of the feet 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.310
 of his legs and already here enter the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.090
 buttons of our 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.800
 of his pants that hold his 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.400
 pants always have as well as a 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.400
 pocket here 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.470
 here we are going to do it like a broken 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.470
 damaged 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.830
 we will begin to draw the arm here 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.830
 of our cookie 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.780
 then something like that would come 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.660
 and the sleeve we're going to do 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.340
 like holding a knife 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.120
 in this character he likes very much the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.730
 knives 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.950
 ready then we have here the arm 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.660
 now we will do here as the catch of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.440
 knife 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.760
 it's like a razor in this way the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.760
 we practice the arm 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.790
 and so here we will draw for the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.790
 other 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.519
 the sleeve 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.519
 and this one we're going to make it open 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.860
 thus 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.090
 and ready 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.220
 and good now we continue with the feet 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.530
 with the shoes by 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.980
 because we already draw them with sisbÃ©n say 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.980
 something like that 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.390
 but here between the laces 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.970
 I love this this one yes I know how to face 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 do not 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.090
 then the cords would already have 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.090
 this form 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.250
 and seen and now we are going to do here the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.070
 neck if it does not fit like weird and the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.730
 round neck shirt and not 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.449

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.120
