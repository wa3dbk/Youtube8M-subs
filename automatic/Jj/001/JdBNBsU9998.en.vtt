00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
written a blog post I mean start out

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.130 
written a blog post I mean start out
with<00:02:22.430> pictures<00:02:22.730> again<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.270> have<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.630> so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.280 
with pictures again if I have them so
you<00:02:24.230> can<00:02:24.500> see<00:02:24.770> how<00:02:25.040> much<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.340> has<00:02:25.490> grown

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
you can see how much it has grown

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.870 
you can see how much it has grown
obviously<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.980> hair<00:02:28.190> would<00:02:28.370> grow<00:02:28.520> without

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
obviously my hair would grow without

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.550 
obviously my hair would grow without
taking<00:02:29.360> these<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> honestly<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.260> things

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
taking these but I honestly do things

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.140 
taking these but I honestly do things
that<00:02:30.710> accrue<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> lot<00:02:31.310> faster<00:02:31.730> than<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:31.910> normally

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
that accrue a lot faster than I normally

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.770 
that accrue a lot faster than I normally
would

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
would

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.660 
would
another<00:02:33.350> thing<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:33.860> have<00:02:34.040> noticed<00:02:34.220> is
