noticeable it feels like a little bit of
a<00:02:33.750> nitpick<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.350> still<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:35.040> nice

joint here or the hand rather so you

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.060 
joint here or the hand rather so you
guys<00:04:09.720> I'm<00:04:09.840> solid<00:04:10.079> range<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.350> movement<00:04:10.650> there<00:04:10.829> a

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
guys I'm solid range of movement there a

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.280 
guys I'm solid range of movement there a
nice<00:04:11.579> ball<00:04:11.820> joint<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.269> leg<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:13.019> skirt

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
nice ball joint for the leg the skirt

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.170 
nice ball joint for the leg the skirt
does<00:04:13.859> hinder<00:04:14.130> her<00:04:14.280> moving<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.609> little<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.820> but

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
does hinder her moving a little bit but

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.460 
does hinder her moving a little bit but
the<00:04:15.359> material<00:04:15.840> actually<00:04:15.900> does<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.169> pretty<00:04:16.260> good

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
the material actually does a pretty good

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.469 
the material actually does a pretty good
job<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:16.829> overtime<00:04:17.340> will<00:04:17.820> probably<00:04:18.120> give<00:04:18.239> even

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
job in overtime will probably give even

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.750 
job in overtime will probably give even
more<00:04:18.660> leeway<00:04:18.979> double<00:04:19.979> knee<00:04:20.100> joint<00:04:20.370> here

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
more leeway double knee joint here

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.210 
more leeway double knee joint here
swiveling<00:04:21.450> at<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.690> leg<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:22.019> well<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:23.099> then

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
swiveling at the leg as well and then

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.710 
swiveling at the leg as well and then
her<00:04:23.310> foot<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.700> on<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.000> nice<00:04:24.210> ball<00:04:24.479> joint

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
her foot is on this nice ball joint

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.990 
her foot is on this nice ball joint
which<00:04:24.930> gives<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.289> great<00:04:25.560> range<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.890> motion

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
which gives you a great range of motion

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.130 
which gives you a great range of motion
depending<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.270> what<00:04:27.420> kind<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.630> poses<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:28.020> want

depending on what kind of poses you want

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.200 
depending on what kind of poses you want
to<00:04:28.230> put<00:04:28.350> her<00:04:28.410> in<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.800> then<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.460> tow<00:04:29.730> that

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
look at hurricane yellow which I think

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.060 
look at hurricane yellow which I think
fares<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.630> little<00:05:12.900> bit<00:05:13.020> better<00:05:13.200> in<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.830> lot<00:05:14.010> of

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
fares a little bit better in a lot of

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.700 
fares a little bit better in a lot of
ways<00:05:14.460> his<00:05:15.180> head<00:05:15.360> sculpt<00:05:15.660> does<00:05:15.990> look<00:05:16.290> a<00:05:16.440> little

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
ways his head sculpt does look a little

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.320 
ways his head sculpt does look a little
skinnier<00:05:17.220> than<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.580> would<00:05:17.730> be<00:05:17.880> on<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.120> show

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
skinnier than it would be on the show

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.510 
skinnier than it would be on the show
but<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.260> is<00:05:19.440> really<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.710> nitpick<00:05:20.040> at<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.280> point

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
but it is really a nitpick at that point

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.340 
but it is really a nitpick at that point
I<00:05:20.700> think<00:05:21.090> with<00:05:21.210> blues<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.810> bring<00:05:21.990> up<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.169> little

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
I think with blues I bring up a little

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.080 
I think with blues I bring up a little
bit<00:05:22.470> better<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.770> point<00:05:23.010> sound<00:05:23.550> braggy<00:05:23.760> but<00:05:23.940> i

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
bit better of a point sound braggy but i

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.880 
bit better of a point sound braggy but i
mean<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.660> can<00:05:24.780> sort<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.020> tell<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.290> looks<00:05:25.620> funny

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
mean you can sort of tell it looks funny

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.790 
mean you can sort of tell it looks funny
with<00:05:26.160> his<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.940> does<00:05:27.270> look<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.870> smidge<00:05:28.230> skinnier

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
with his it does look a smidge skinnier

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.440 
with his it does look a smidge skinnier
but<00:05:29.280> it's<00:05:29.400> really<00:05:29.580> more<00:05:29.820> nitpicky<00:05:30.300> than

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
but it's really more nitpicky than

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.030 
but it's really more nitpicky than
anything<00:05:30.690> other<00:05:31.290> than<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.530> i<00:05:31.650> think<00:05:31.770> it

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
anything other than that i think it

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.800 
anything other than that i think it
looks<00:05:32.070> good<00:05:32.490> they<00:05:33.240> did<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.419> really<00:05:33.570> good<00:05:33.690> job

black<00:06:06.360> basic<00:06:06.720> it's<00:06:07.020> Blazek<00:06:07.290> so<00:06:08.250> he<00:06:08.400> pretty

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
black basic it's Blazek so he pretty

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.640 
black basic it's Blazek so he pretty
much<00:06:08.729> has<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.090> same<00:06:09.419> mold<00:06:09.690> as<00:06:09.960> hurricane<00:06:10.410> red

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
much has the same mold as hurricane red

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.560 
much has the same mold as hurricane red
so<00:06:11.190> he's<00:06:11.340> got<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.580> same<00:06:11.700> articulation<00:06:11.970> he<00:06:12.390> did

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
so he's got the same articulation he did

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.630 
so he's got the same articulation he did
which<00:06:12.750> was<00:06:12.870> very<00:06:13.020> well<00:06:13.140> done<00:06:13.500> like<00:06:14.340> I<00:06:14.430> said

went<00:06:51.119> over<00:06:51.269> with<00:06:51.360> hurricane<00:06:51.719> blue<00:06:51.959> but<00:06:52.229> the

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
went over with hurricane blue but the

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.859 
went over with hurricane blue but the
male<00:06:52.589> version<00:06:52.919> so<00:06:53.639> very<00:06:53.909> nicely<00:06:54.179> done<00:06:54.569> out<00:06:54.839> of

the<00:06:55.110> two<00:06:55.319> I<00:06:55.349> do<00:06:55.559> prefer<00:06:56.069> him<00:06:56.279> in<00:06:56.429> terms<00:06:56.639> of

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
the two I do prefer him in terms of

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.820 
the two I do prefer him in terms of
finger<00:06:57.149> I<00:06:57.330> think<00:06:58.080> that<00:06:58.199> he<00:06:58.319> just<00:06:58.349> doesn't<00:06:58.619> have

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
finger I think that he just doesn't have

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.739 
finger I think that he just doesn't have
many<00:06:59.009> proportion<00:06:59.489> issues<00:06:59.789> he<00:07:00.269> does<00:07:00.449> look<00:07:00.659> a

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:00.749 
many proportion issues he does look a

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:02.179 
many proportion issues he does look a
smidge<00:07:00.989> skinnier<00:07:01.379> than<00:07:01.499> on<00:07:01.619> the<00:07:01.739> show<00:07:01.919> but

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.189 
smidge skinnier than on the show but

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:03.649 
smidge skinnier than on the show but
when<00:07:02.309> you<00:07:02.429> need<00:07:02.580> to<00:07:02.699> use<00:07:02.789> the<00:07:02.909> same<00:07:03.119> mold<00:07:03.389> what

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
when you need to use the same mold what

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:04.969 
when you need to use the same mold what
are<00:07:03.719> you<00:07:03.809> going<00:07:03.929> to<00:07:03.989> do<00:07:04.139> about<00:07:04.259> it

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
are you going to do about it

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.769 
are you going to do about it
the<00:07:05.279> only<00:07:05.429> other<00:07:05.669> small<00:07:05.999> issue<00:07:06.209> I<00:07:06.269> have<00:07:06.479> is<00:07:06.509> the

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:06.779 
the only other small issue I have is the

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:08.719 
the only other small issue I have is the
sort<00:07:06.989> of<00:07:07.050> creases<00:07:07.319> you<00:07:07.559> can<00:07:07.709> see<00:07:07.889> here<00:07:08.249> but

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729 
sort of creases you can see here but

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.459 
sort of creases you can see here but
that's<00:07:08.909> really<00:07:09.569> just<00:07:09.719> a<00:07:09.839> nitpick<00:07:10.169> at<00:07:10.289> this

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:10.469 
that's really just a nitpick at this

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.159 
that's really just a nitpick at this
point<00:07:10.739> but<00:07:11.669> overall<00:07:12.149> I'm<00:07:12.539> really<00:07:12.899> pleased

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
point but overall I'm really pleased

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.689 
point but overall I'm really pleased
with<00:07:13.289> these<00:07:13.469> figures<00:07:13.769> I<00:07:13.949> really<00:07:14.459> liked

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
with these figures I really liked

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.850 
with these figures I really liked
hurricane<00:07:15.149> red<00:07:15.389> and<00:07:15.629> I<00:07:15.929> really<00:07:16.199> still<00:07:16.559> do<00:07:16.709> like

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
hurricane red and I really still do like

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.369 
hurricane red and I really still do like
these<00:07:17.069> figures<00:07:17.429> my<00:07:18.209> main<00:07:18.419> issue<00:07:18.629> is<00:07:18.959> just<00:07:19.229> from

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:19.379 
these figures my main issue is just from

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.259 
these figures my main issue is just from
her<00:07:19.499> helmet<00:07:19.649> his<00:07:20.219> helmet<00:07:20.610> is<00:07:20.699> such<00:07:20.819> a<00:07:20.849> nitpick

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:21.269 
her helmet his helmet is such a nitpick

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:22.850 
her helmet his helmet is such a nitpick
but<00:07:21.449> I<00:07:21.479> still<00:07:21.749> think<00:07:21.990> they're<00:07:22.199> really<00:07:22.409> solid

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
but I still think they're really solid

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.269 
but I still think they're really solid
figures<00:07:23.219> figures<00:07:23.909> have<00:07:24.360> great<00:07:24.659> articulation

at least with mine they have a large

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.459 
at least with mine they have a large
amount<00:07:29.639> of<00:07:29.699> accessories<00:07:30.330> I<00:07:30.539> still<00:07:31.019> enjoy<00:07:31.050> them
