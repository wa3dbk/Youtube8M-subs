00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.049
 it's not about actually killing for 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 the fucking assholes 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.650

 okada 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.750
 to be on top of the other 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.370
 Setting is dark and very funny 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.830
 I really thought that this anime was 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.190
 for bastards but finally like 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.920

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.280
 test which is true later 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.130

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.160

 the yagami light characters I already talked about 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.630
 he 's a good-ass bastard who does not 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.090

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.910
 asshole asshole but good is the one 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.800
 makes sense of the whole story 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.030
 through their intelligence and their 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.700
 murders 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.459

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.620
 favorite of the story for many 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.319
 including me you can say it's a 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.020
 police the truth is the best point 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.540

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.540
 I do not handle the story he likes many 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.970
 the candy and that is the enemy of the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.950
 mass to manÃ© or mass to mass is the typical aunt 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.160
 good and lameculos of the protagonists 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.590
 fuck that aunt is good I should have walked 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.080
 with her x of good she is considered 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.810
 the second strip because she too 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.360
 I had a death notebook fuck is the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.810
 girlfriend or whore of the light light you are a 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.030

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.620
 good shinigamis I will not talk about them 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.630
 I will only say points are some bastards point 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.600
 we have the most honest character in the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.570
 story in my opinion the father of light 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.910
 died with honor under his work was a 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.980
 great man and the worst is that the fucking 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.340
 delight told him son of a bitch before 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.400
 die 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.000
 damn good we have the air to melo 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.570
 I'll just say I'm a son of a bitch 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.570
 nair I like is my reincarnation 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.460
 thank you the case x was over 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.610
 continue what neither I could but 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.760
 good as I was saying unlike 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.680
 of melo is more rivers here the only thing that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.950
 I liked this little guy was he was 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.070
 very childish fuck but he is a fuck 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.720
 in general guattari another that should not 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.240
 die since he is an old man very 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.030
 Intellectual and famous fuck should not 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.640
 I liked dying because I worked more 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.370
 for x of good let's change the subject 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.060
 let's talk about the movies I liked 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:42.380
 a lot of the movies because one story 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:47.000
 different 2 has an alternative ending 3 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.850
 is live action and others more fuck apart 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.950
 of my great performance hehe in history 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.860
 I do not die for light but because I eat 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.410
 fucking shit I put my good name the 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.920
 movies that they made were three the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.050
 first titled simply death note 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.780
 the second death note 2 the last name 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.940
 and the last one will change the world without 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.100
 doubt that is the best in my role 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.620
 besides that the live exxon was 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.930
 excellent they improved it by giving it a final 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.450
 alternative is undoubtedly one of the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.360
 best movies liberation not like that 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.130
 shit that they took out of my favorite series 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.560
 dragon ball evolution fucked 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.540
 totally hopefully light will use a 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.360
 blade to kill those assholes of 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.490
 good shit already to cover the last 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.790
 topic that we should talk the final 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.440
 original of death note now that's how it was 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.040
 biggest shit in the history of 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.100
 late fuck at the end all but when 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.290
 I say all are all important are 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.740
 die I went ahead dying in the 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.110
 2004 light yagami dies in 2010 according to 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.090
 the last manga that they took out if 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.500
 want to see go or manga dot com web 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.660
 link and look for it 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.750
 I do not find who liked that ending 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.570
 some must have been fuck died on 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.180
 Fucking fucking but for me 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.400
 the end of the movie was better 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.470
 which I win but the two other than 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.470
 Mass in the anime does not show when he dies 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.440
 but she dies in 2011 is not known 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:19.250
 what the manga does not say the series is 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.650
 short only takes 37 chapters but each 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.290
 chapter is like being in an exam 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.240
 but concentrated addictive fun good 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.730
 dead is not you without doubt is one of my series 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.590
 preferred despite the ending but good 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.610
 not all the time you have what you 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.680
 wants 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.890
 well the series was saved from the thing that 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.110
 kill any anime the fillings do not 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.590
 had none, that's why it was 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.300
 very nice this series for being so much already in 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.940
 Japan have started to imitate the 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.940
 characters and that's why they brought fame to 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.430
 this anime that is good to fuck for 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.440
 fucking series fanboys I recommend 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.410
 much this series for which there is not 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.050
 ok I got tired of writing like that 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:04.139
 that follow the series of and line ocean way 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:07.289
 is fired are goku 05 18 and that alive 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:09.889
 dead note especially me x from chau and 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:09.889
 until next time
