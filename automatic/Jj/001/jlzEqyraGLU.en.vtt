00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 come to clarify this matter are 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 precisely the people who say 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.940
 have obtained the triumph and are 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.940
 they stole what he is doing and there 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.160

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.520
 I said and he leaves me the mind leaves you mind 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.520
 explained 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:30.960
 I already tell you to dance 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.720
 to have a perfect rating 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.730
 like the one you have between 1000 same 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.730
 and me too 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.080
 one thing all and respect for the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.790
 participants of this forum and more than one 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.020
 lady with mobility no p if we are going to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.390
 start a conversation we are going to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 make it as decent people as what 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.310
 are'm just not gay innocent request 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.559
 he obeys briefly to no jury in the 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.280
 fact that you have danced badly and that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.949
 sing even worse is no brother 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.380
 Cahill here is already behind the scenes before 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.030
 that the air entered jared told me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.580
 how was it possible that they had given 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.920
 the triumph before you do not dance that why not 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.740
 you dance that you look like a trunk that you see 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.390
 very heavy that you're overweight and the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.390
 which is a true 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.950
 this one I apologize angry apologize 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.829
 accepted 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.000
 I never asked for it, I never was merit 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.000
 yes never 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.679
 that's why I decide the same 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.910
 that being you my dear gil never 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.319
 it was merit because in the case of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.620
 producer and friend of mine never wanted it 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.620
 we all know 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.250
 but I want to show you that you should not 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.760
 have won since everything is one thing 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.450
 all right 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.969
 unfortunately for the couple 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.310
 talented with which competes are you 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.439
 you were the three that led to the defeat 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.379
 because neither is a talented girl 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.219
 dance unfortunately, they do not have 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.219
 neither of the two particularities 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.219
 listen to it 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.159
 and sing as well as the angels and so crazy 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.189
 as young people 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.810
 but pavarotti geniuses of best effort 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.950
 it's not that I can 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.140
 If we make a mistake, I accept it but if 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.520
 you sing but you do not dance the truth of fact 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 I do not know why they gave you that year 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.849
 because he has a perfect rating 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.270
 if you do not dance 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.849
 dance no not me I did not like like like 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.200
 truthfully dance truthfully 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.019
 we are wrong and the truth 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.599
 it's not because it's not about defending myself with 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:24.040
 why they put us this and not 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.780
 We listened to the music tell you something 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.489
 our course was jessica because you have 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.489
 three ballerinas discuss which 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.790
 the wardrobe says it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.790
 the day that we are full of envy 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.910
 I can not believe so much envy that 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.910
 exists 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.150
 talent for the way you dance because 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.370
 have friends what i am having is 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.240
 that the three participants the couple more 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.240
 that you 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.810
 participating you lost 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.960
 I think I took dance better but yes but 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.960
 you do not win
