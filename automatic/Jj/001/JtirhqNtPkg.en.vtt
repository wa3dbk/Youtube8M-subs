00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.850 
press here five pounds heavier than last
week<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.580> 200<00:02:09.299> pounds<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.500> we're

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
you'll see some grinders in here but

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.100 
you'll see some grinders in here but
like<00:02:18.510> I've<00:02:18.660> said<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.019> past<00:02:19.790> typically

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
with me I know that even if i grind the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.289 
with me I know that even if i grind the
weight<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.110> long<00:02:25.709> as<00:02:25.769> i<00:02:26.010> get<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.610> i

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
week and progress that way so all in all

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.240 
week and progress that way so all in all
it's<00:02:39.989> been<00:02:40.110> working<00:02:40.319> really<00:02:40.470> well<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.980> this

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it's been working really well like this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.550 
it's been working really well like this
and<00:02:41.549> i<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.360> installed<00:02:42.720> yet<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.410> i'm<00:02:43.530> just

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
and i have installed yet so i'm just

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.229 
and i have installed yet so i'm just
going<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.860> keep<00:02:44.040> pushing<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.549> until<00:02:45.060> i<00:02:45.090> can

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
going to keep pushing it until i can

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.319 
going to keep pushing it until i can
just<00:02:45.959> milk<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:47.430> close<00:02:47.819> as<00:02:48.000> i<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.150> get

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
just milk it for as close as i can get

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.470 
just milk it for as close as i can get
to<00:02:48.480> 225<00:02:49.049> i<00:02:49.109> think<00:02:49.470> i'll<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.650> able<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.889> get

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
to 225 i think i'll be able to get

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.890 
to 225 i think i'll be able to get
probably<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.989> 225<00:02:52.819> with<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.850> steady<00:02:54.209> five-pound

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
probably to 225 with a steady five-pound

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.530 
probably to 225 with a steady five-pound
increase<00:02:55.319> each<00:02:55.739> week<00:02:56.069> from<00:02:56.609> 200<00:02:57.060> pounds<00:02:57.420> up

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
increase each week from 200 pounds up

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.840 
increase each week from 200 pounds up
until<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:57.989> if<00:02:58.590> i<00:02:58.799> do<00:02:58.859> stall<00:02:59.280> i'm<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.549> throne

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
until there if i do stall i'm a throne

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.759 
until there if i do stall i'm a throne
addy<00:03:00.090> load<00:03:00.329> where<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.630> bring<00:03:01.170> my<00:03:01.319> bench<00:03:01.530> press

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
addy load where I bring my bench press

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.800 
addy load where I bring my bench press
way<00:03:01.950> down<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.549> week<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.030> we'll<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.660> when

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
way down for one week but we'll see when

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.479 
way down for one week but we'll see when
that<00:03:03.930> time<00:03:04.170> comes<00:03:04.470> set<00:03:05.310> for<00:03:05.609> here<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:07.079> think<00:03:07.560> one

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that time comes set for here I think one

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.550 
that time comes set for here I think one
of<00:03:08.519> these<00:03:08.670> sets<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.840> always<00:03:10.079> like<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.350> third

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
of these sets it's always like the third

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.590 
of these sets it's always like the third
or<00:03:10.680> fourth<00:03:10.950> set<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.400> kind<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
or fourth set that's kind of more of a

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.020 
or fourth set that's kind of more of a
grinder<00:03:12.989> than<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.290> last<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.609> all<00:03:14.730> kind<00:03:14.880> of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
grinder than the last and it all kind of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.879 
grinder than the last and it all kind of
take<00:03:15.269> like<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> sort<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.410> longer<00:03:16.620> break

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
take like a sort of a longer break

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.039 
take like a sort of a longer break
before<00:03:17.130> my<00:03:17.370> last<00:03:17.579> set<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.180> ensure<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> hit

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
before my last set to ensure that I hit

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.890 
before my last set to ensure that I hit
it<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.410> then<00:03:19.920> sometimes<00:03:20.910> my<00:03:21.000> rep<00:03:21.329> speed<00:03:21.690> will

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it and then sometimes my rep speed will

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.170 
it and then sometimes my rep speed will
actually<00:03:22.260> be<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> little<00:03:22.709> bit<00:03:22.889> faster<00:03:23.880> on<00:03:24.120> my

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
actually be a little bit faster on my

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.379 
actually be a little bit faster on my
final<00:03:24.630> set<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.459> all<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.670> all<00:03:26.760> my<00:03:26.940> shoulders

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
final set but all in all my shoulders

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.780 
final set but all in all my shoulders

really<00:03:49.560> sliding<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.069> your<00:03:50.159> palm<00:03:50.370> at<00:03:50.549> all<00:03:50.670> I

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
really sliding in your palm at all I

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.690 
really sliding in your palm at all I
don't<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:51.870> maybe<00:03:52.110> it's<00:03:52.260> placebo<00:03:53.189> mental<00:03:53.579> but

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
don't know maybe it's placebo mental but

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.010 
don't know maybe it's placebo mental but
I<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:53.909> like<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.209> do<00:03:54.329> it

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
I was going to do cable rows first but

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.840 
I was going to do cable rows first but
um<00:03:57.390> they<00:03:58.200> were<00:03:58.260> taken<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.310> decided<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.730> hit

um they were taken so I decided to hit
up<00:03:59.970> these<00:04:00.090> dumbbell<00:04:00.450> rows<00:04:00.660> I'm<00:04:00.900> keeping<00:04:01.260> it

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
up these dumbbell rows I'm keeping it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.100 
up these dumbbell rows I'm keeping it
relatively<00:04:01.830> light<00:04:02.160> sets<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.120> 12<00:04:03.390> with<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.720> 80s

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
relatively light sets of 12 with the 80s

my lap trying to solely feel it in the
lower<00:04:09.780> left<00:04:10.110> form<00:04:11.040> does<00:04:11.280> break<00:04:11.490> down<00:04:11.520> a<00:04:11.730> little

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
lower left form does break down a little

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.610 
lower left form does break down a little
bit<00:04:12.090> as<00:04:12.270> i<00:04:12.300> get<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> later<00:04:12.870> sets<00:04:13.230> but<00:04:13.410> just

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
bit as i get to the later sets but just

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.350 
bit as i get to the later sets but just

okay<00:04:18.330> with<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:18.510> as<00:04:18.780> long<00:04:18.810> as<00:04:18.959> I'm<00:04:19.170> feeling

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
okay with that as long as I'm feeling

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.979 
okay with that as long as I'm feeling
the<00:04:19.620> weight<00:04:20.060> really<00:04:21.060> where<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.510> want<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.840> feel

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the weight really where I want to feel

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.460 
the weight really where I want to feel
it<00:04:22.020> in<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.740> lats<00:04:22.950> now<00:04:23.700> here<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.630> decided<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.260> get

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
it in the lats now here I decided to get

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.050 
it in the lats now here I decided to get
the<00:04:25.530> 80s<00:04:25.980> on<00:04:26.070> incline<00:04:26.430> dumbbell<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.940> was

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
the 80s on incline dumbbell and I was

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.340 
the 80s on incline dumbbell and I was
like<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.360> right<00:04:27.390> maybe<00:04:27.630> I'll<00:04:27.810> go<00:04:27.930> for<00:04:28.110> five<00:04:28.320> or

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
like all right maybe I'll go for five or

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.680 
like all right maybe I'll go for five or
six<00:04:28.650> reps<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.160> then<00:04:29.550> drop<00:04:29.790> down<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> 70s

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
six reps and then drop down to the 70s

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.280 
six reps and then drop down to the 70s
and<00:04:30.810> 60s<00:04:31.610> but<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.940> surprised<00:04:33.420> myself<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:34.080> ended

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
and 60s but I surprised myself and ended

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.490 
and 60s but I surprised myself and ended
up<00:04:34.380> getting<00:04:34.890> ten<00:04:35.160> reps<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.420> kept<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.200> with

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
up getting ten reps so I kept it with

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.740 
up getting ten reps so I kept it with
the<00:04:37.590> 80<00:04:37.740> pound<00:04:38.040> dumbbells<00:04:38.400> four<00:04:39.150> sets<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.510> 10<00:04:39.720> i

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
the 80 pound dumbbells four sets of 10 i

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.320 
the 80 pound dumbbells four sets of 10 i
did<00:04:40.050> two<00:04:40.620> sets<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:40.950> ten<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.190> then<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.060> believe

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
did two sets of ten and then I believe

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.480 
did two sets of ten and then I believe
instead<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.690> eight<00:04:42.870> on<00:04:43.020> my<00:04:43.110> last<00:04:43.290> step<00:04:43.620> now<00:04:43.890> it

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
instead of eight on my last step now it

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.990 
instead of eight on my last step now it
doesn't<00:04:44.760> really<00:04:44.880> look<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.260> I'm<00:04:46.550> going<00:04:47.550> real

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
doesn't really look like I'm going real

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.620 
doesn't really look like I'm going real
low<00:04:48.270> here<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.430> pretty<00:04:50.760> much<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
low here but this is pretty much the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.030 
low here but this is pretty much the
lowest<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.830> i<00:04:53.160> was<00:04:53.460> i<00:04:53.640> could<00:04:53.700> get<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.240> my<00:04:54.420> chest

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
lowest I i was i could get with my chest

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.160 
lowest I i was i could get with my chest
before<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.400> would<00:04:56.520> feel<00:04:56.730> unnatural<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:58.020> like

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
before it would feel unnatural and like

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.480 
before it would feel unnatural and like
I<00:04:58.290> was<00:04:58.380> about<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.710> like<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.100> know<00:04:59.130> tear

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
I was about to like you know tear

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
something so i was getting full range of

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.210 
something so i was getting full range of
motion<00:05:02.220> there<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.780> all<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.620> all<00:05:04.680> felt<00:05:05.040> good<00:05:05.190> i

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
motion there and all in all felt good i

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.500

is my last chest movement wanted to get
in<00:06:02.610> another<00:06:02.970> fly<00:06:03.300> instead<00:06:03.690> of<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:03.870> pressing

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
in another fly instead of a pressing

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.469 
in another fly instead of a pressing
motion<00:06:04.440> ended<00:06:05.280> up<00:06:05.400> doing<00:06:05.640> a<00:06:05.669> drop<00:06:05.910> set<00:06:06.210> after

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
motion ended up doing a drop set after

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.190 
motion ended up doing a drop set after
this

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
this

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.840 
this
and<00:06:07.320> that's<00:06:08.010> not<00:06:08.160> something<00:06:08.310> I'll<00:06:08.580> do<00:06:08.700> in<00:06:08.790> the

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
and that's not something I'll do in the

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.340 
and that's not something I'll do in the
beginning<00:06:08.940> my<00:06:09.240> workouts<00:06:09.630> too<00:06:09.840> much<00:06:09.990> but<00:06:10.230> at

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
beginning my workouts too much but at

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.900 
beginning my workouts too much but at
the<00:06:10.440> end<00:06:10.470> i<00:06:10.800> do<00:06:10.860> like<00:06:11.100> to<00:06:11.130> burn<00:06:11.340> out<00:06:11.490> sometime

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
the end i do like to burn out sometime

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.390 
the end i do like to burn out sometime
so<00:06:12.300> that's<00:06:13.170> always<00:06:13.380> an<00:06:13.560> idea<00:06:13.830> especially<00:06:14.070> if

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
so that's always an idea especially if

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.400 
so that's always an idea especially if
you're<00:06:14.610> on<00:06:14.970> an<00:06:15.180> isolation<00:06:15.720> movement<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.200> just

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
you're on an isolation movement you just

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.980 
you're on an isolation movement you just
want<00:06:16.560> to<00:06:16.650> max<00:06:17.070> out<00:06:17.250> at<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.520> end<00:06:17.960> you<00:06:18.960> know

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
want to max out at the end you know

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.300 
want to max out at the end you know
sometimes<00:06:19.380> I<00:06:19.440> like<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:19.590> do<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:19.920> just<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.190> get

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
sometimes I like to do that just to get

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.190 
sometimes I like to do that just to get
a<00:06:20.370> little<00:06:20.520> pump<00:06:20.790> in<00:06:21.000> but<00:06:21.270> lat<00:06:21.540> pulldown<00:06:21.960> was<00:06:22.050> my

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
a little pump in but lat pulldown was my

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.290 
a little pump in but lat pulldown was my
last<00:06:22.410> exercise<00:06:22.950> which<00:06:23.250> is<00:06:23.430> not<00:06:23.580> very<00:06:23.610> typical

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
last exercise which is not very typical

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.720
