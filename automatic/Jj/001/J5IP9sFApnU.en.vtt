00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.880
 yes 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.850
 my accusers already complete previous what 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.160
 already understood with the Italians the 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.980
 air defense system has already received the payment 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.480
 the two Italian planes are fierce 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.599
 acquired by the Ministry of Defense 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.700
 have brought more than one headache 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.070
 irritable minister pedro cateriano up 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.930
 what has permanently prevented 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.119
 purchases in the defense sector 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.820
 they have been precisely those periodicazos 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.850
 that complaint that made the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.670
 people these aircraft bought at the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.260
 Italian company Alenia are questioned 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.650
 for its high price 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.110
 31 points 79 million euros each 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.150
 more expensive than aircraft also 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.320
 European countries that participated in the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
 bidding 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.880
 the question that surely you 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.370
 will be doing falls out of maturity because 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.290
 was spent so much on these aircraft if in a 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.720
 principle this investment project the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.640
 year 2010 it is specified that those of the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.670
 Alenia company consume more fuel 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.760
 and do not meet expectations 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.060
 operational 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 President Ollanta Humala's brother 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.490
 bises is one of those that questions the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.640
 purchase of these aircraft we do not have a 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.100
 minister who says there's a green light to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.280
 do an operation and continue as 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.380
 minister when we know that in that 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.540
 Ministry are buying aircraft 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.840
 with an overvaluation of 10 million 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 of dollars per unit 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.219
 when we see that purchases are made 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 secret we are talking about honesty 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.219
 the 2010 investment project 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.159
 recommends buying the plane c 295 of the 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.439
 Spanish company home as indicated by 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.719
 its efficiency to operate in the fields 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.600
 of the jungle and the coast with greater 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.659
 economy also transports more passengers 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.789
 and load with low fuel consumption 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.579
 and maintenance what a 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.670
 lower cost per flight hour then 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.560
 we are facing a bad purchase these 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.019
 Italian aircraft purchased by the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.349
 Ministry of Defense are good or are 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.849
 bad the Italian planes are 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.769
 extraordinary are not only good 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.510
 just like your competitor to the plane 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.269
 Spanish is an extraordinary plane 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.819
 also but the operational requirement 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.110
 of the country and the air force that is a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.530
 operator 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.060
 comply with all those factors for 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.650
 which we require the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.800
 replacement of transportation goods in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.750
 general fap carlos chávez cateriano 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.820
 communications director admits that the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.400
 price of Italian aircraft is 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.230
 We are honest and sincere in saying 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.350
 that the Italian plane is a little bit more 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.510
 expensive to buy is a little more expensive 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.900
 per flight hour and fuel in 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.870
 but fuel efficiency makes 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.780
 reduce transportation times to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.450
 half of what the other does 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.440
 model in such a way that an analysis of 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.660
 efectivity cost 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.330
 it turns out that the Italian plane is a lot 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.550
 more efficient much more secure and for 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.709
 end in the cheapest but for 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.900
 demonstrate its effectiveness gave us a 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.810
 example let's suppose we have a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.910
 friaje emergency in juliaca which is 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.940
 very usual every year in our country 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.150
 and we want to transport 20 tons of 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.060
 load the Spanish plane fulfills the mission 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.410
 of course but it needs six flights 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.430
 to do it 33 hours 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.580
 to accomplish the mission at a cost of 203 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.740
 thousand 115 soles approximately in 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.810
 fuel operating expenses 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.590
 the Italian plane to transport these 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.570
 20 tons requires only 4 flights 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 because your cargo hold is twice as 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.970
 size of the Spanish plane and will use 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.770
 only 14 hours of flight half that 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.470
 the other because it 's faster is more 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.720
 efficient and the total cost will be 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.060
 only 137 thousand soles 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 there is a difference of 70 thousand soles a 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.160
 favor of the Italian area then yes 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.950
 finally the flight time of the plane 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.420
 Spanish is smaller ends up being more expensive 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.580
 because he needs twice as many hours of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.350
 flight to be able to transport this cargo 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.990
 the engines of the plane have to have 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.780
 enough power to cross 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.090
 the mountain range without problems and allow 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.850
 given an emergency with failure of a 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.700
 engine continue flying thing that for the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.370
 Spanish model will become extremely 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.840
 difficult the minister pedro cateriano 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.240
 exposed last week on the commission 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.960
 of defense the reasons why you are 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.020
 Aircraft were a good buy 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.729
 that this plane was acquired against the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.199
 technical opinion as to the capacity 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.539
 the technical opinion at that time the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:52.710
 air force because the capacity of the 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:55.530
 plane not for not allowing to transport 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.560
 quality is not only acquiring 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.530
 the airplanes but also a support 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.560
 logistics is to say spare parts that 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.890
 allow the operation of these aircraft 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.410
 for two years the members of this 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.510
 commission point out that nothing is observed 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.000
 Suspect at the moment in this purchase 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.400
 but anyway there is a group that 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.310
 will investigate in depth all the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.860
 purchases made by this ministry 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.620
 there is a working group that chairs the 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.300
 yrupaílla congressman who is in charge 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.790
 to see the acquisitions that the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.920
 defense sector we have already installed the 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.320
 group as of January we have 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.900
 invitations to the minister of defense to 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.090
 internal unison and several authorities 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.680
 more and we will investigate to see the type 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.350
 of acquisitions that has been done call 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.570
 aircraft called munitions they were already saying 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.160
 military or police implements for 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.260
 that the plane is Italian that is 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.120
 Spanish that is French already depends on 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.250
 them from the bids they have made 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.170
 of the opening that they have given and about 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.760
 all of the order that is made the strength of 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.800
 time that the main thing is to be based on the 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.750
 request of people who will handle the 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.100
 scratches 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.040
 do not let us take care much 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.650
 Beware of frustrated salespeople 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.139
 that many times they throw below 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.699
 his missiles to finish knocking down a 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.250
 purchase and in the end we stayed in 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.410
 planes to the gentlemen that companies 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.150
 that these planes offer if they have 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.190
 some claims to do that 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.780
 come here that your representatives are coming 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.000
 give the face to speak directly 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.860
 and state your reasons 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.780
 here we are to serve them andres 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.759
 Gómez de la Torre points out that this 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.300
 controversy unleashed by the purchase of 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.669
 Italians spartans et 27j is not positive 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.500
 for the country there is a controversy because 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.810
 unfortunately day traditions 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.150
 military are not only technical but 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.340
 there are also propagandistic factors and 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.560
 journalistic by the competition of the 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.380
 companies have immobilized companies 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.570
 lobbies campaign obviously with the 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.360
 intention to win tenders there 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.599
 ships that have been operating for more than 25 years 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.039
 and you need a change the reality is 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.840
 that the transport aircraft of 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.110
 our armed and police forces 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.849
 have collapsed and it is already positive that 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.039
 that fleet is modernized 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:11.069
 fulfill the important missions for 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:13.199
 those that are destined however there 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.059
 to explain calmly without 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.789
 get irritated like the minister does 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:20.069
 cateriano and especially thinking that it 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:22.439
 it's about the money of the Peruvians without 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:24.839
 spend more for Italian aircraft in 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:27.649
 place of the Spanish will be beneficial 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:27.649
 for the country
