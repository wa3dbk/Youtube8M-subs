00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
might be like that it might have one bit

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
might be like that it might have one bit
looking<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.229> end<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.769> bit<00:01:04.949> sticking<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
looking at this end one bit sticking and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.490 
looking at this end one bit sticking and
that's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> go<00:01:07.260> you

that's not the way you want to go you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.580 
that's not the way you want to go you
want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:09.060> spring<00:01:09.570> facing<00:01:10.380> down

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
want to have your spring facing down

normal if you just do it the way that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
normal if you just do it the way that
you've<00:01:15.330> probably<00:01:15.650> made<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> mistake<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:18.590> so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590

you've probably made the mistake with so
what<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
what we do is we just put it in here and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
what we do is we just put it in here and
then<00:01:24.229> yeah<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.560> let's<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> wrong

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then yeah so let's put it in the wrong

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.569 
then yeah so let's put it in the wrong
way<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.610> look<00:01:28.009> let's<00:01:29.009> say<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> push

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
way and look let's say you have to push

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.920 
way and look let's say you have to push
it<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.180> push<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.450> back<00:01:30.509> man<00:01:30.689> again

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it up and then push your back man again

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
it up and then push your back man again
not<00:01:31.439> great<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.829> again<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.280> claim<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.759> more

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
not great for again and claim or more

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
not great for again and claim or more
after<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.479> whatever<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.320> play

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
after three whatever you want to play

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.069 
after three whatever you want to play
it's<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.340> exactly<00:01:35.759> ideal<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.960> you're

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it's not exactly ideal so what you're

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's not exactly ideal so what you're
going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> need<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.490> going

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
going to need to do is you're just going

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
going to need to do is you're just going
to<00:01:38.670> need<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> push<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:39.960> dad<00:01:40.140> simple<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
to need to push your dad simple as that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.940 
to need to push your dad simple as that
and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.689> need<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> wedge

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and then you just need to try and wedge

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.810 
and then you just need to try and wedge
it<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.119> stays<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> need

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it just so it stays down and then I need

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.120 
it just so it stays down and then I need
to<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:50.899> put<00:01:51.899> into<00:01:52.610> its<00:01:53.610> place<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to do is put into its place it really is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.639 
to do is put into its place it really is
as<00:01:56.340> simple<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.360> mean<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> had<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
as simple as that I mean I had the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.149 
as simple as that I mean I had the
problem<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.659> looked<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.710> it's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
problem I looked up and you know it's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.929 
problem I looked up and you know it's
it's<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:04.020> call<00:02:04.380> an<00:02:04.530> error<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.040> mean<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.430> wasn't

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it's I call an error I mean I wasn't

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.089 
it's I call an error I mean I wasn't
paying<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.240> much<00:02:06.540> attention<00:02:06.950> when<00:02:07.950> i<00:02:07.979> took

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
paying that much attention when i took

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.550 
paying that much attention when i took
it<00:02:08.459> apart<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:10.080> i<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.619> thought<00:02:10.800> i'd<00:02:10.950> share

going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.540> I'm<00:02:18.980> trading<00:02:19.980> my

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
going to have to I'm trading my

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.670 
going to have to I'm trading my
controller<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.850> buy<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> new<00:02:21.209> one<00:02:21.630> but<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.319> am<00:02:22.440> no

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
controller and buy a new one but I am no

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.640 
controller and buy a new one but I am no
that's<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> way<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.819> turned<00:02:24.180> out<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.650> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that's not the way it turned out and it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.820 
that's not the way it turned out and it
turned<00:02:25.920> out<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.270> thought<00:02:27.540> that

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
turned out good so I just thought that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.140 
turned out good so I just thought that
instead<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.890> keeping<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> myself<00:02:29.459> I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
instead of keeping it to myself I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
instead of keeping it to myself I
thought<00:02:31.020> about<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.350> guys<00:02:31.650> know<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.310> case

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
thought about you guys know just in case

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.780 
thought about you guys know just in case
you<00:02:32.640> ever<00:02:32.820> encounter<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.900> problem<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.310> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
