00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 and hello to all and all your friends 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.420
 fear series and today we find ourselves 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.010
 for the murder of assassin's creed iv 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.170
 berck fac on ps4 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.509
 so I will have received today the 19th 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.599
 november i did not expect it at all i 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 thought that to receive 21 to the 21st day of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.710
 exit so I did not expect everything 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.769
 just because it's not a day 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.279
 the output is to say I did not think 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.800
 even more so suddenly 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 the carrier ups and came care to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 bring I was really expecting no 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 parcel I did not think at all that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.809
 it was these so that after 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 baggage I range and deferred as 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.190
 as always almost micro of 2 of the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.870
 laptop is really really bad 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 so we can already see that the taste that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.760
 is pretty imposing his galley I had to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.160
 cover so there is my darling who is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 came to help me to film for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.750
 open a necklace in the video as 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.879
 you can see so I took a liking to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.769
 the match edition is edifying a team of 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.869
 hacks four frames that is available 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.240
 on all media ps4 ps3 xbox one 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.830
 touch for where I go out we can see that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 it's really awesome me when I 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.580
 saw that I thought, but what's 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.140
 is waiting for me inside how 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.259
 how is it possible to have done 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.210
 something so big so for a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.310
 once I get a game before a day 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 released it falls badly because I did 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 not even to consume 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 short so I'm going to go open and I 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.799
 will show you what takes the most 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.689
 place in this case this edition is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.869
 simply the figurine that I'm going 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.450
 show you right now then by 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.950
 against we want to see figurines which is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.390
 really awesome so here I go 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.329
 cut because it's true that I 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.189
 galley to cover so we can see a 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.970
 kind of little card I think I 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.960
 thought it was a parchment even 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.439
 it's a map 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.549
 so I'm going to cut the video because 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.850
 I really loved a lot of time 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.399
 aguirre and I galley and I see will enter 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.399
 end of the video completely assembled 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.030
 So if I show you around 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 thematically designed to assemble all 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.360
 the parts of you that figurine 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.480
 I believe is the biggest big 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.459
 never done by ubisoft 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.069
 there are several steps to realize that I 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.420
 you will explain just now hey he 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.860
 is not very stable I you I you 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.600
 explain why just now and 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 I show you how to make a little 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.090
 more a little more stable 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.830
 this is then 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.320
 what's it binds to other in 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.739
 this box then no other thing that 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.060
 surprised me is that there are two frames 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.620
 horde is nothing behind rim of these four 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.040
 that I almost dropped it viable 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.989
 flag pirate flag that was supposed 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.440
 apparently be embroidered or play where I do not 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.230
 know what but that does not seem to be 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.769
 with two frames really really enjoys 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.980
 of hero Edward Quesnoy and his 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.769
 boat jack of water I believe his 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.030
 castle his punishment his boat that 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.010
 is called like that 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.019
 then of course like to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.590
 the usual in collector's edition your 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.650
 sting book where you can put up to 2 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.500
 cd so we'll see right away we'll 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.540
 decide for the xbox 360 version which I 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.730
 think will benefit from two dvd 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.820
 unlike the version in position 4 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.890
 ps3 xbox one who will benefit from this borough 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.760
 given that Bourg is able to 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.480
 much larger storage 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:50.700
 good me I passed as a common second 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.989
 dvd I put the dvd of his stuff that I 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.730
 shows you just now then wins 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.250
 small envelope with weapons 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.440
 freedom nassim edition creed iii of 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.450
 guitaut graphie where we can see 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.910
 abnormally low and same thing as this 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.660
 reframing the hero edward can wait and 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.489
 his boat right behind so that's it 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.320
 do not love myself personally I do not 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.329
 do not know where I'm going to put all this 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.430
 do not have much room in my 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.930
 apartment but I would find a way 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.090
 of 10 chandeliers and this in a beautiful setting 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.060
 gold here there was what's called the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.039
 artbook so 7 on small books and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.470
 where we can really see everything and everyone 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:35.070
 artistic drawings made for 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:37.500
 for the game with a finger for game 4 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.509
 so good so I do not want everything you 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.460
 show I flipped through it quickly I 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:48.000
 will look in detail later then 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.490
 me cdc wesh cousin it was 200 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.810
 leaflets so it's really him and the 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.880
 music of the game 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.139
 so I looked at his debts or tiger and 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.610
 I actually found there were 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.639
 music even two of the old 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.570
 assassin's creed not just from that 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.340
 so I feel all that is contained 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.490
 of collector auditions I think I 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.250
 could have really looked at it a bit 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.259
 in detail only until I have the ps4 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.150
 so created at yaya game jacket 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.280
 to my surprise the game jacket 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.440
 is in English I do not know why 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.380
 I ordered on the ubishop apparently 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.240
 it is a mode at ubisoft de ivry and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.130
 Jacques and English me it bothers me 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.380
 I do not speak very well removed 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.479
 so it can bother some players 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.750
 French then there are sixty minutes of 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:37.650
 more gameplay for the cheeks and 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.139
 playstation players on ps3 vs 4 like 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.500
 another regular and that's it there is also 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.210
 write a little trick about the racket 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.400
 contest we can not re 27th copy 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.020
 so good I hope this video will have you 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.280
 more case we will immediately go to 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.759
 something else and I'm going to show you a 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.759
 little my figurine completely installed 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.490
 over here we can finally see that I 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.740
 managed to assemble this figurine which 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.000
 really gave me a hard time 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.500
 rotor because simply she does not 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.220
 not hold then just shove him 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.560
 a little it falls to the method that my 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.169
 darling advised me to put everything 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.639
 just a flag to the left of the 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.930
 character which makes it actually the 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:26.190
 flag will make a kind of balance 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.740
 between characters and even needle 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.320
 so that even boat are holding 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.960
 a lot better after that is when 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.520
 not even stable at all is enough that fast 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.680
 have moved a little figurines and while 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:44.729
 I put bags with the world book 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.010
 below the flag aja my box that 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.440
 is really big 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:52.349
 the two frames with the ally of 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.070
 lithographs and the little map and 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:59.310
 here is the cardboard that just below me 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.529
 did not have anything to propose there is 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.849
 this mboka jacques is right next to 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.770
 right of the figurine 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.539
 I hope this visit will have pleased you and 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.770
 I'll hold you next on hd 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.770
 chaory reporting people
