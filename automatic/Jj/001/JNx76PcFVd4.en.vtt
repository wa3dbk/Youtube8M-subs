00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello everyone with you sale in your today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.940
 we will have too 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.849
 a quick glance at the seemingly pretty 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 ancient model but with a small upgrade 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.779
 called this model air force lumma well 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 or lunar force 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.340
 I do not know how you like so you can 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.630
 call it looks like this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.080
 nike lunar force probably liza that is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 leather 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.059
 I do not know what this reduction is likely 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.600
 so it is inside familiar to force here 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.800
 such here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 carton on it as if he could see 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.789
 sneaker force well and it is called 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.850
 probably a certificate that is, in principle 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.980
 If you do not come across the box 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.230
 this cardboard or something and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.449
 or lost or maybe you 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 provide poor quality product 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:10.830
 interesting point in the package is this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:15.540
 such stars on paper 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 branding on paper is visible to you or 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:25.790
 no, we will try to bring it closer 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.400
 stars tinted and written on them with 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 1985 box itself looks on top 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.900
 like this nike air force 1 that is when 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.240
 you buy a force 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.920
 such a box 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.570
 but this force of gray is burnt and he has 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.369
 depreciation element not by the will of the ride 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.710
 on a lunar 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.950
 and it basically makes them very 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.360
 comfortable and very comfortable but again, 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.990
 playing them is probably not very interesting 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.819
 but you can have these sneakers in 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.679
 principle in terms of depreciation 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.680
 traction of course quite so 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.890
 tolerable can basically use them 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 both for the game and for peugeot left 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.940
 what do we have here 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.830
 force and still give us Velcro 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.760
 inside cardboard I support here u 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:41.550
 us a brief story no story just 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:46.709
 It is written here is such a thing that the company 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.610
 nike from really made it their direct from 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.379
 I will pass the markarian guarantees quality 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.760
 top pretty leather 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.430
 she has such an interesting texture not 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.800
 I know how it is called correctly 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.129
 similar to some streaks 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.550
 technological ventilation 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.970
 it says here that it is 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:16.330
 force lunar 1 and 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.610
 hall that immediately catches the eye and 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.340
 felt by hand 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.370
 this is that this farce has become much easier 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.920
 because the poly-vitamin is certainly very 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.800
 hard very heavy material and thats 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.100
 Well, not a super feather, of course, but 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.790
 pretty easy and interesting such 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.340
 sneakers in this case, in principle, left 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.010
 all the same a little bit changed 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.050
 materials and most basic is 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.360
 added lunar here so we 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.430
 I got a quick look I think that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.750
 the company will not continue to release 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.920
 these sneakers, I think that already 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.450
 low version for walking and others 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.670
 depreciation elements are used 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.110
 for these, that is, nike is just 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 refreshed the classics and made it more 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.390
 modern principle to me such a move is very 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.980
 liked with you was the salon me and 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.620
 force he r1 or lunar force 1 as you 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.620
 Thank you for watching
