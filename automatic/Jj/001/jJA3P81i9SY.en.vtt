00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
single day we scrub the serrations of

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.060 
single day we scrub the serrations of
our<00:02:37.600> clamps<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.140> make<00:02:38.320> sure<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.740> they<00:02:38.860> are

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
our clamps to make sure that they are

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.330 
our clamps to make sure that they are
spotless<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:41.140> then<00:02:41.320> dry<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.590> Tri<00:02:41.890> gene<00:02:42.160> off

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
spotless we then dry the Tri gene off

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.920 
spotless we then dry the Tri gene off
pop<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.270> into<00:02:44.130> self<00:02:45.130> sealable<00:02:45.550> bags<00:02:45.930> make

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
pop them into self sealable bags make

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.270 
pop them into self sealable bags make
sure<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.230> those<00:02:47.350> are<00:02:47.560> all<00:02:47.650> vacuumed<00:02:48.070> and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
sure that those are all vacuumed and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.030 
sure that those are all vacuumed and
sealed<00:02:49.180> properly<00:02:49.450> then<00:02:50.350> they<00:02:50.530> go<00:02:50.680> into<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
sealed properly then they go into the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.880 
sealed properly then they go into the
autoclave<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.820> 40-minute<00:02:52.390> cycle<00:02:52.810> at<00:02:52.900> 134

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
autoclave for a 40-minute cycle at 134

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.970 
autoclave for a 40-minute cycle at 134
degrees<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.870> reason<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.290> we<00:02:56.410> put<00:02:56.620> them<00:02:56.770> into

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
degrees the reason that we put them into

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.640 
degrees the reason that we put them into
bags<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.580> because<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> bag<00:02:58.900> itself<00:02:59.290> has<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
bags is because the bag itself has a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.650 
bags is because the bag itself has a
stereo<00:02:59.950> indicator<00:03:00.520> on<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.270> will<00:03:01.390> show

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
stereo indicator on it so it will show

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.300 
stereo indicator on it so it will show
you<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:01.990> it<00:03:02.140> has<00:03:02.260> been<00:03:02.440> through<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.709> autoclave

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
you if it has been through the autoclave

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.290 
you if it has been through the autoclave
and<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.630> bags<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.680> side<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.100> paper<00:03:06.400> one

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
and with the bags one side is paper one

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.699 
and with the bags one side is paper one
side<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.990> like<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> critic<00:03:09.790> plastic<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
side is like a critic plastic and the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.220 
side is like a critic plastic and the
paper<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.100> one-way<00:03:12.370> permeable<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.720> basically

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
paper is one-way permeable so basically

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.199 
paper is one-way permeable so basically
the<00:03:14.470> Steen<00:03:14.680> goes<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.130> through<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> paper<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the Steen goes in through the paper and

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.630 
the Steen goes in through the paper and
then<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> paper<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.230> sealed<00:03:17.470> shut<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.519> it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
then the paper is sealed shut so it

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.820 
then the paper is sealed shut so it
keeps<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.450> instrument<00:03:19.959> perfectly<00:03:20.560> clean

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
keeps the instrument perfectly clean

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.920 
keeps the instrument perfectly clean
once<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.670> instrument<00:03:21.880> comes<00:03:22.239> out<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.750> bag

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
once the instrument comes out of the bag

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.720 
once the instrument comes out of the bag
I<00:03:23.230> always<00:03:23.530> rain<00:03:23.830> wine<00:03:24.040> with<00:03:24.250> 90<00:03:24.610> percent

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
I always rain wine with 90 percent

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.060 
I always rain wine with 90 percent
isopropyl<00:03:25.150> alcohol<00:03:25.780> which<00:03:26.260> basically<00:03:26.709> kills

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
isopropyl alcohol which basically kills

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.880 
isopropyl alcohol which basically kills
anything<00:03:27.340> airborne<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.090> could<00:03:28.209> get<00:03:28.390> onto<00:03:28.540> it

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
anything airborne that could get onto it

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.979 
anything airborne that could get onto it
branding-iron<00:03:29.890> wise<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.420> way<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:31.810> clean

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
branding-iron wise the way that we clean

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.750 
branding-iron wise the way that we clean
our<00:03:32.140> branding<00:03:32.560> tips<00:03:32.830> is<00:03:33.040> pretty<00:03:33.280> simple

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
our branding tips is pretty simple

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.170 
our branding tips is pretty simple
really

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
really

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.300 
really
you<00:03:34.780> can't<00:03:35.110> put<00:03:35.350> branding<00:03:35.769> tips<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.190> an

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
you can't put branding tips in an

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.890 
you can't put branding tips in an
autoclave<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:37.390> not<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.630> problem

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
autoclave but that's not a problem

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.470 
autoclave but that's not a problem
because<00:03:38.260> there<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.980> really<00:03:39.400> no<00:03:39.550> point<00:03:39.790> cooking

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
because there is really no point cooking

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.320 
because there is really no point cooking
something<00:03:41.070> 134<00:03:42.070> degrees<00:03:42.220> when<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.940> actual

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
something 134 degrees when the actual

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.550 
something 134 degrees when the actual
unit<00:03:43.660> itself<00:03:43.720> runs<00:03:44.320> at<00:03:44.500> 750<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:47.200> there<00:03:47.440> is

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
unit itself runs at 750 so there is

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.870 
unit itself runs at 750 so there is
nothing<00:03:47.950> really<00:03:48.220> that's<00:03:48.370> going<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.610> live<00:03:48.760> on

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
nothing really that's going to live on

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.750 
nothing really that's going to live on
there<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.530> all<00:03:50.709> you're<00:03:50.890> doing<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.340> making<00:03:51.549> sure
