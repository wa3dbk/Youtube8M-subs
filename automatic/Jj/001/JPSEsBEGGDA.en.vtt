 burn a lot of calorie and today it will not 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.210
 being different will show a lesson that 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.620
 mix ballet with fitness besides burning 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.840
 The subject of calories you go 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:57.670
 to qualify the muscles as it is 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:00.460
 Everything for you now I 'm here with the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.070
 creators of this modality raffaele 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 girl, alright , listen and listen here. 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.530
 Cool idea of ​​mixing ballet with fitness 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.000
 where did this idea is because 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.890
 first we put classic ballet 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.810
 Even for women here at the gym. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.720
 we did not have much demand for 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.760
 clothes 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.640
 an hour an hour and a half in the bush 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.860
 For me, I train to work and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.010
 until they lost calories and they thought 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.170
 talking is easy was so interesting right? 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.960
 that's when we try easy chantal 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.409
 where this is to be achieved. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.409
 wifey 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.780
 but it's new to everything, it's been a while since 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.909
 You invented the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.960
 in 2000 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.000
 I saw it today 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.490
 The full class said that in the morning they did not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.590
 It is so crowded but the night was the leader's 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.680
 hertha bar as more women or 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.970
 The less we've come around you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.970
 who has 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.030
 he speaks of the benefits because ballet 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.910
 classic we already know that thing 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.610
 of posture looks beautiful people see the tone 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.830
 the dancers or lean and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.740
 impeccable does not move its arms to with 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.709
 the wages of ferrai will tell how 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.200
 can be so beautiful and delicate not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.270
 It's any difference of this you seem 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.410
 you can get a little more 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.959
 your work a little more with 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.790
 intensity is that it was your impression and 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.430
 the indifference of any elastic band 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.150
 order if there is you use this peace 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.880
 sealed 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.900
 as it is used to more arm 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.720
 to the leg then I run is the most part 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.940
 of executives in class works more 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.400
 lower limbs folks take the band 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.959
 to give a balanced in the exercises 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.959
 it is also with the outside environment 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.770
 I just wanted to be one, it's cool, said ballet. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.520
 facts even have culture 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.730
 It's where the work of those who boot is. 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.030
 abdomen 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.430
 the track is how long this torture 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 giving wonderful results while 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.780
 entrust to the left it is the hour 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.260
 21 minutes 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.230
 I think one of the students reaches 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.480
 different angles two months the staff 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.319
 managed to lose a goal 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.959
 rates on time to those who smoke group 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.959
 a little already have only poorer 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.940
 Come and ask you how many classes. 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.870
 in the interesting week do back to see 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.940
 the fastest result in 2002 two 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.100
 because it has other possibilities and that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.470
 even at the clan academy and comes to 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.760
 but if you wanted to do everything 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.210
 quiet day is not so is not the most 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.750
 indicated for our purpose is not the 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.090
 indicated because the flow is then 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.370
 here one day, yes, day would not be perfect 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.299
 Yes, I can, not only that it does not help 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.070
 exaggerated 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.810
 I always say what this 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.940
 summer smell is coming and everyone 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.860
 You want to get well soon and there will not 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.390
 have to do it right and rest 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.560
 because resting you see the 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.560
 faster result 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.969
 Hmm 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.320
 and demand has increased because 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.610
 different innovator imagines two months in the 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.200
 market people are still 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.540
 knowing I think you'll meet 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.560
 much more has no age limit so 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.070
 you have 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.170
 I know from 19 to 60 years old to do 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.120
 You have not seen this coming here and 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.860
 make it fun with them they leave with 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.860
 a mission accomplished guy 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.380
 what we said that has this track 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.419
 elastic I saw that most of the 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.669
 exercises are done in the bar so as not to 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.910
 run away from ballet but every once in a while you 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.790
 changes a little bit this is not that today 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.370
 We made two néné exercises 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.820
 frequency of how we do classes 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.790
 Sometimes we pick it up It 's a little class more 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.550
 It's obvious then we do exercises in 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.360
 bar goes more pro center of vacaria year 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.910
 he uses more the rate of the week is for 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.370
 change meant in practice the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.229
 same thing and do not accommodate either 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.229
 exploded was condendo we got 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.780
 songs known to this every hundred 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.940
 to just be working hard 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.660
 That's cool, and that's what I'm going to 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.070
 you in relation to the music they listen 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.070
