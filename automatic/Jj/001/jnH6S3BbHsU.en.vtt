chilling built in Windsor where we have

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.389 
chilling built in Windsor where we have
a<00:01:43.060> lot<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.270> tolling<00:01:43.799> capabilities<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.100> sent

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
a lot of tolling capabilities and sent

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.800 
a lot of tolling capabilities and sent
it<00:01:45.490> over<00:01:45.579> to<00:01:45.729> montana<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.479> rings<00:01:46.689> were

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
it as well and what I've done is removed

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
it as well and what I've done is removed

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
it's exciting and it also allows people
