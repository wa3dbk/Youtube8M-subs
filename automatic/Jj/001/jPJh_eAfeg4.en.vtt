the RiRi hearts Mac smoked Coco palette
from<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.220> collection<00:00:27.000> she<00:00:27.029> released<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
from the collection she released a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.679 
from the collection she released a
couple<00:00:27.779> weeks<00:00:28.410> months<00:00:29.099> ago<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.359> figured

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
couple weeks months ago and I figured

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
couple weeks months ago and I figured
what<00:00:30.960> better<00:00:30.990> way<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.380> incorporate<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.340> than

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
what better way to incorporate it than

in<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.300> Rihanna<00:00:33.600> inspired<00:00:34.020> look<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.030> music

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
in a Rihanna inspired look so the music

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
in a Rihanna inspired look so the music
video<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.840> think<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.440> agree<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
video I think we can all agree that it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
video I think we can all agree that it
is<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:38.670> different<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.899> she<00:00:39.930> normally

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is very different from what she normally

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
is very different from what she normally
puts<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.309> slightly<00:00:41.550> demonic<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
puts out it was slightly demonic and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.010 
puts out it was slightly demonic and
resembled<00:00:43.399> exorcism<00:00:44.399> type<00:00:44.879> qualities<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
resembled exorcism type qualities but I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
resembled exorcism type qualities but I
loved<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.680> different<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
loved it it was different and I think it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.510 
loved it it was different and I think it
really<00:00:48.210> brought<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.440> her<00:00:49.649> symbolism<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
really brought out her symbolism for the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
really brought out her symbolism for the
relationship<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.239> her<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> Chris<00:00:51.960> Brown

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
relationship with her and Chris Brown

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
relationship with her and Chris Brown
just<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.010> don't<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.610> kind<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
just I don't know it's kind of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
just I don't know it's kind of
heartbreaking<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.480> anyways<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.140> loved

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
heartbreaking but anyways I really loved

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770
