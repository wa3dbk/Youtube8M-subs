00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.210 
mode to white mat so that I can see the
area<00:02:14.870> that's<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.590> masked

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
area that's going to be masked

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.550 
area that's going to be masked
now<00:02:17.090> I'll<00:02:17.210> increase<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.600> feather<00:02:17.900> value<00:02:18.290> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
now I'll increase the feather value and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.190 
now I'll increase the feather value and
you<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.460> see<00:02:19.820> how<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.210> gives<00:02:20.420> my<00:02:20.660> selection

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
you can see how this gives my selection

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.670 
you can see how this gives my selection
a<00:02:21.290> faded<00:02:21.710> edge<00:02:21.860> rather<00:02:22.670> than<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.000> defined<00:02:23.360> one

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a faded edge rather than a defined one

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.660 
a faded edge rather than a defined one
so<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> will<00:02:24.980> blend<00:02:25.130> into<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.640> background

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
so it will blend into the background

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.220 
so it will blend into the background
more<00:02:26.209> easily<00:02:27.250> okay<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.640> looks<00:02:28.820> good<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:30.170> to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
more easily okay that looks good now to

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.400 
more easily okay that looks good now to

here's another quick example of how you
can<00:04:40.640> use<00:04:40.820> this<00:04:41.000> method<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.900> pop<00:04:42.110> color<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.710> a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
can use this method to pop color in a

can use this method to pop color in a
black-and-white<00:04:43.310> image<00:04:43.730> I<00:04:44.740> convert<00:04:45.740> my<00:04:45.770> photo

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
black-and-white image I convert my photo

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.400 
black-and-white image I convert my photo
to<00:04:46.370> black<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.730> white<00:04:46.820> by<00:04:47.690> adding<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:48.050> black<00:04:48.230> and

to black and white by adding a black and
white<00:04:48.470> film<00:04:48.740> adjustment<00:04:50.890> you<00:04:51.890> can<00:04:51.920> see<00:04:52.280> that

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
white film adjustment you can see that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.830 
white film adjustment you can see that
this<00:04:52.520> has<00:04:52.700> added<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.120> black<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.510> white<00:04:53.600> film

this technique can be used to create

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:23.270 
this technique can be used to create
some<00:05:15.009> really<00:05:15.189> cool<00:05:15.520> effects

understanding of them and are looking
forward<00:05:36.379> to<00:05:36.560> experimenting<00:05:36.919> with<00:05:37.490> them<00:05:37.639> in
