up the cubicles a bit now some of the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.829 
up the cubicles a bit now some of the

mats have started to curl up a bit as

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.770 
mats have started to curl up a bit as
you<00:00:06.960> can<00:00:06.990> see<00:00:08.179> they're<00:00:09.179> not<00:00:09.269> set<00:00:09.599> down

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
you can see they're not set down

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.470 
you can see they're not set down
properly<00:00:11.540> and<00:00:12.540> some<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.559> them<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> bit<00:00:13.740> ripped

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
properly and some of them a bit ripped

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.460 
properly and some of them a bit ripped
so<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.630> we're<00:00:15.750> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.379> going

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.380 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:16.529> put<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:16.890> new<00:00:17.070> cubicle<00:00:17.699> mats<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> few<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to put some new cubicle mats in a few of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.870 
to put some new cubicle mats in a few of
the<00:00:18.449> places<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:20.100> generally<00:00:20.460> tidy<00:00:20.699> up

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the places and just generally tidy up

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.000 
the places and just generally tidy up
because<00:00:21.300> realistically<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.590> only<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.830> matter

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
because realistically it's only a matter

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.179 
because realistically it's only a matter
of<00:00:23.160> kind<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.880> month<00:00:24.720> or<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.949> perhaps

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
of kind of a month or so if that perhaps

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.099 
of kind of a month or so if that perhaps
before<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.609> open<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.880> site<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.480> toilets<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
before we open that site the toilets a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.830 
before we open that site the toilets a
little<00:00:28.320> bit<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.680> let<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.460> cows<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.269> the

see<00:01:36.320> they're<00:01:36.470> pretty<00:01:36.620> worn<00:01:36.890> out<00:01:37.750> they<00:01:38.750> tend<00:01:38.930> to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
see they're pretty worn out they tend to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
see they're pretty worn out they tend to
split<00:01:39.380> after<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.890> while<00:01:41.560> there's<00:01:42.560> just<00:01:42.710> no<00:01:42.890> good

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070

to<00:01:43.220> anything<00:01:43.580> worn<00:01:44.360> out<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.700> we<00:01:46.820> get<00:01:47.000> rid<00:01:47.060> of

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
to anything worn out so we get rid of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.070 
to anything worn out so we get rid of
those<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:50.090> we're<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:50.360> putting<00:01:50.720> in<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.900> new

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080

there we go that's that Matt secure day
now<00:02:40.750> as<00:02:41.750> we<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:42.019> see<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:43.840> few<00:02:44.840> more<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.140> sort<00:02:45.410> out

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
now as we can see a few more to sort out

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.850 
now as we can see a few more to sort out
the<00:02:45.800> old<00:02:45.920> ones<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.310> put<00:02:46.940> back<00:02:47.120> into<00:02:47.150> place<00:02:47.860> and
