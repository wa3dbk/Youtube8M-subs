00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.470

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.779
 I hope you're doing a lot less 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.390
 quiet and today we find ourselves 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.760
 with lots of news on black ops three 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.649
 years in a row started with the first 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.870
 information is the leak of all 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.540
 maps of black ops 3 what are the codes 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.170
 so of each map so I specify that 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.809
 the wanted and vac codes combined and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.699
 stronghold already appear 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.100
 so precisely these codes can not 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.170
 necessarily to see the name of the map and this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.799
 who jumped at me from this code 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.610
 mp new town x would that be the return of 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.530
 nuke tarn 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.989
 well yes look here again

 other evidence of others screen here 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.369
 we have a message on ps4 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.250
 since Brazil ten years that we can 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.189
 preorder nuke tarn for the release of the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.650
 game it is stated that they have redid the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:21.220
 map for the new motion system 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.659
 playstation deleted from this alone 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.390
 this message 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.610
 but the image is not at all made for 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.439
 We continue with this leaked poster 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.979
 indicates that we can preorder the 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.960

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.299
 30 days before leaving on the others 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.369
 platforms we are super fun these 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.859
 information for me nocturn is 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.439
 confirmed already that there is this image that 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.659
 comes from the official code site 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.479
 I think they did not put it for 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.159
 nothing and then deleted for nothing no 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.679
 more latest news we'll talk about 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.990
 last is 9th and specialists finally 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.909
 revealed so here was a lot of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.899
 debates what will it be the last 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.299
 specialist 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.030
 the new ability of this specialist 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.959
 to be a flamethrower so that was 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.429
 leaked since the beta 2 bo3 pc so the 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.400
 ability it's a ball of flames 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.840
 who are you hatched and burn the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.300
 enemies for about three seconds 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.709
 here it is in spear flames I can not wait 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.150
 to test it 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.340
 so that's what finding the return of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.319
 dull nuke is what he is good is this 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.700
 that it was good to redo the nuke map 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.819
 tarn well is what they could have 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.050
 to make another map to change a little 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.030
 frankly it's to see how she 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.430
 will be the map lived according to the new 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.480
 movement system as we will be able to 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.460
 move etc 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.290

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.080
