these controls adjust horizontal and
vertical<00:03:33.800> position<00:03:34.599> these<00:03:35.599> are<00:03:35.780> just

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
vertical position these are just

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.220 
vertical position these are just
rotation<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.120> these<00:03:38.120> let<00:03:38.360> me<00:03:38.480> resize<00:03:38.870> the
