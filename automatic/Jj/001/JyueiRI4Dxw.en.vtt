00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the first question for today is I always

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.470 
the first question for today is I always
hear<00:00:23.250> people<00:00:23.310> talking<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:24.240> how

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
hear people talking about how

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
hear people talking about how
overpowered<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> medic<00:00:25.529> class<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.980> in

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
overpowered the medic class is in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.400 
overpowered the medic class is in
battlefield<00:00:26.730> 3<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.119> thought<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.720> making<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
battlefield 3 I thought that making the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.529 
battlefield 3 I thought that making the
revive<00:00:28.740> animation<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> recharge<00:00:30.210> timer

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
revive animation or the recharge timer

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
revive animation or the recharge timer
longer<00:00:31.140> would<00:00:31.260> help<00:00:31.500> lower<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> number<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
longer would help lower the number of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
longer would help lower the number of
people<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.880> play<00:00:33.180> medic<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.140> change<00:00:34.559> would

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
people that play medic this change would

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.520 
people that play medic this change would
also<00:00:34.950> prevent<00:00:35.399> long<00:00:35.910> revive<00:00:36.480> trains<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.170> small

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
also prevent long revive trains on small

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
also prevent long revive trains on small
maps<00:00:37.800> such<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.160> Grand<00:00:38.340> Bazaar<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> Metro<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
maps such as Grand Bazaar and Metro I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.580 
maps such as Grand Bazaar and Metro I
would<00:00:39.390> love<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> hear<00:00:39.750> thoughts<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.379> next

but then when you actually think about

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.219 
but then when you actually think about
it<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> realize<00:01:30.930> you're<00:01:31.079> actually

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it you just you realize you're actually

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
it you just you realize you're actually
killing<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> same<00:01:31.920> people<00:01:32.100> over<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> over

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
killing the same people over and over

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
killing the same people over and over
again<00:01:32.970> they're<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.479> being<00:01:33.600> revived<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
again they're just being revived all the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
again they're just being revived all the
time<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:36.150> suggestion

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
time and so I think that your suggestion

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
time and so I think that your suggestion
of<00:01:37.049> increasing<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.100> animation<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
of increasing the animation time and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
of increasing the animation time and
some<00:01:39.270> people<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:39.799> recommend<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.250> can

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
some people even recommend that you can

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
some people even recommend that you can
only<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> limited<00:01:42.270> number<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.899> revives

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
only have a limited number of revives

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
only have a limited number of revives
before<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.700> can't<00:01:44.939> use<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.210> tool<00:01:45.689> anymore<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
before you can't use that tool anymore I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
before you can't use that tool anymore I
think<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.220> too<00:01:47.340> far

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
think that's going a little bit too far

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
think that's going a little bit too far
but<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.390> increased<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
but I think if they just increased the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.950 
but I think if they just increased the
animation<00:01:49.950> time<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:51.030> maybe<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.360> couple<00:01:51.750> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
animation time to maybe a couple of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
animation time to maybe a couple of
seconds<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.740> first<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.430> all<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:53.909> make

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
seconds then first of all it would make

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.730 
seconds then first of all it would make
it<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.210> lot<00:01:54.270> harder<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:55.020> revives<00:01:55.350> off<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it a lot harder to get revives off you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.830 
it a lot harder to get revives off you
can<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.189> ninja<00:01:56.610> revive<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.240> switch

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
can just like ninja revive and switch

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.410 
can just like ninja revive and switch
back<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.079> your<00:01:58.680> primary<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.909> half<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
back to your primary like in half a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.760 
back to your primary like in half a
second<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:01.530> merry

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
second and then just go on your merry

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
second and then just go on your merry
way<00:02:01.920> you'd<00:02:02.520> actually<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> dedicate<00:02:03.450> some

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
way you'd actually have to dedicate some

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
way you'd actually have to dedicate some
time<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.610> your

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
time to actually to get your your

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
time to actually to get your your
soldier<00:02:06.390> back<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.560> only<00:02:07.680> would<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
soldier back up and not only would that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.249 
soldier back up and not only would that
leave<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> vulnerable<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> would<00:02:09.569> reduce

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
leave you vulnerable but it would reduce

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
leave you vulnerable but it would reduce
the<00:02:10.470> effectiveness<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.129> those<00:02:11.760> medic<00:02:12.090> trains

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the effectiveness of those medic trains

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.110 
the effectiveness of those medic trains
and<00:02:12.629> I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.640 
and I
I<00:02:13.150> think<00:02:13.540> that's<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.810> really<00:02:14.080> good<00:02:14.200> idea<00:02:14.260> I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
I think that's a really good idea I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.500 
I think that's a really good idea I
don't<00:02:14.830> think<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.489> ruin<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.090> game<00:02:16.269> by

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
don't think it would ruin the game by

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.300 
don't think it would ruin the game by
any<00:02:16.690> means<00:02:17.019> sure<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.650> would<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.010> would<00:02:18.040> change

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
any means sure it would it would change

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.640 
any means sure it would it would change
how<00:02:18.580> people<00:02:18.610> would<00:02:19.569> approach<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.170> class<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
how people would approach that class you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.520 
how people would approach that class you
can<00:02:20.830> do<00:02:21.280> business<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:22.120> usual<00:02:22.569> but<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.200> think<00:02:23.409> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
can do business as usual but I think it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.780 
can do business as usual but I think it
would<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> step<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.549> right<00:02:24.730> direction

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
would be a step in the right direction

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.690 
would be a step in the right direction
and<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> would<00:02:25.780> put<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.230> class<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.890> line<00:02:27.280> with

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
and it would put the class in line with

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.039 
and it would put the class in line with
the<00:02:27.790> other<00:02:27.819> ones<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> would<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
the other ones I what I would like to

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.149 
the other ones I what I would like to
know<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:29.409> guys<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.799> do<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.069> think

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
know what you guys think do you think

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.280 
know what you guys think do you think
the<00:02:30.610> medic<00:02:30.849> class<00:02:30.940> as<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.599> right<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:31.900> is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the medic class as it is right now is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.839 
the medic class as it is right now is
too<00:02:32.470> powerful<00:02:32.650> would<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.549> see<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.210 
they're patching a cycle is a little
slow<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.319> little<00:02:59.530> annoying<00:02:59.799> but<00:03:00.069> that's

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
slow it's a little annoying but that's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.860 
slow it's a little annoying but that's
probably<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.940> completely<00:03:01.359> other<00:03:01.540> video

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
probably for a completely other video

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.319 
probably for a completely other video
but<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.680> know<00:03:02.799> dice<00:03:03.069> really<00:03:03.609> has<00:03:03.790> given<00:03:04.180> us<00:03:04.239> a

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
but you know dice really has given us a

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.839 
but you know dice really has given us a
lot<00:03:04.359> of<00:03:04.540> content<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.140> really<00:03:05.590> once<00:03:05.829> once<00:03:06.579> end

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
lot of content and really once once end

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.300 
lot of content and really once once end
game<00:03:06.940> has<00:03:07.390> been<00:03:07.659> released<00:03:08.069> battlefield<00:03:09.069> 3

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
game has been released battlefield 3

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.520 
game has been released battlefield 3
will<00:03:09.579> be<00:03:09.760> about<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.209> year<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:10.720> half<00:03:10.870> old<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
will be about a year and a half old and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.680 
will be about a year and a half old and
if<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.310> think<00:03:12.670> about<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.150> probably<00:03:13.390> spent

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
if you think about it you probably spent

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.050 
if you think about it you probably spent
around<00:03:13.780> sixty<00:03:14.290> dollars<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.549> main<00:03:15.760> game

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
around sixty dollars for the main game

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.339 
around sixty dollars for the main game
and<00:03:16.239> they<00:03:16.299> probably<00:03:16.480> spent<00:03:16.659> around<00:03:16.900> fifty

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
and they probably spent around fifty

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.949 
and they probably spent around fifty
dollars<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.950> are<00:03:18.099> a<00:03:18.130> premium<00:03:18.549> user<00:03:18.669> so<00:03:19.359> for

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
dollars if you are a premium user so for

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.870 
dollars if you are a premium user so for
a<00:03:19.989> hundred<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.500> ten<00:03:20.650> dollars<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.340> got<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.579> game

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
a hundred and ten dollars you got a game

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.940 
a hundred and ten dollars you got a game
that's<00:03:22.180> lasted<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> year<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.560> half<00:03:23.769> and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
that's lasted you a year and a half and

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.860 
that's lasted you a year and a half and
probably<00:03:24.250> even<00:03:24.340> longer<00:03:24.870> considering

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
probably even longer considering

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.509 
probably even longer considering
probably<00:03:26.169> going<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.349> play<00:03:26.620> once<00:03:27.099> end<00:03:27.340> game<00:03:27.489> is

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
probably going to play once end game is

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.280 
probably going to play once end game is
released<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.090> continue<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.720> play<00:03:28.959> if<00:03:29.169> you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
released and continue to play if you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.830 
released and continue to play if you
enjoy<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.519> really<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.090> my<00:03:31.299> opinion<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
enjoy it and so really in my opinion to

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.839 
enjoy it and so really in my opinion to
think<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.379> dice<00:03:32.620> should<00:03:33.069> give<00:03:33.250> us<00:03:33.400> even<00:03:33.579> more

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
think that dice should give us even more

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.119 
think that dice should give us even more
content<00:03:34.569> for<00:03:34.780> battlefield<00:03:35.169> 3<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.560> would<00:03:35.829> say<00:03:35.980> is

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
content for battlefield 3 I would say is

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.800 
content for battlefield 3 I would say is
like<00:03:36.310> naive<00:03:36.609> by<00:03:37.030> any<00:03:37.209> means<00:03:37.419> but<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.599> think

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
like naive by any means but I think

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.690 
like naive by any means but I think
you're<00:03:37.930> asking<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.709> little<00:03:38.829> bit<00:03:39.069> too<00:03:39.220> much<00:03:39.459> and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
you're asking a little bit too much and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.000 
you're asking a little bit too much and
really<00:03:40.180> once<00:03:40.660> we<00:03:41.019> do<00:03:41.200> get<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.650> end<00:03:41.769> game<00:03:41.949> dlc

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
really once we do get the end game dlc

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.099 
really once we do get the end game dlc
and<00:03:42.579> we<00:03:42.639> played<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.000> for<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.150> long<00:03:43.359> time<00:03:43.569> there's

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
and we played it for a long time there's

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.110 
and we played it for a long time there's
probably<00:03:44.500> going<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.829> lot<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.310> news<00:03:45.669> and<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
probably going to be a lot of news and a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.330 
probably going to be a lot of news and a
lot<00:03:46.329> of<00:03:46.599> hype<00:03:47.169> around<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.799> battlefield<00:03:48.069> 4

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
lot of hype around a battlefield 4

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.949 
lot of hype around a battlefield 4
because<00:03:48.639> in<00:03:48.819> about<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.120> year<00:03:49.510> now<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.750> think

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
because in about a year now I think

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.900 
because in about a year now I think
there<00:03:50.620> hasn't<00:03:50.949> been<00:03:50.980> an<00:03:51.190> official<00:03:51.489> release

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
there hasn't been an official release

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.789 
there hasn't been an official release
date<00:03:51.970> by<00:03:52.269> any<00:03:52.419> means<00:03:52.629> but<00:03:53.109> I<00:03:53.199> think<00:03:53.379> they<00:03:53.500> said

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
date by any means but I think they said

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.050 
date by any means but I think they said
that<00:03:53.919> they're<00:03:54.069> scheduled<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.549> release

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
that they're scheduled to release

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.599 
that they're scheduled to release
battlefield<00:03:55.629> 4<00:03:55.780> in<00:03:55.840> about<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.079> year<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:57.310> once

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
battlefield 4 in about a year so once

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.780 
battlefield 4 in about a year so once
once<00:03:58.090> an<00:03:58.480> end<00:03:58.660> game<00:03:58.840> has<00:03:59.109> rolled<00:03:59.859> out<00:04:00.069> we're

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
once an end game has rolled out we're

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.280 
once an end game has rolled out we're
probably<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.209> going<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.540> be<00:04:01.629> really<00:04:01.900> excited

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
probably all going to be really excited

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.869 
probably all going to be really excited
about<00:04:02.379> battlefield<00:04:02.739> 4<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.280> looking<00:04:03.579> forward

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
about battlefield 4 and looking forward

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.789 
about battlefield 4 and looking forward
to<00:04:03.970> battlefield<00:04:04.359> 4<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:04.840> then<00:04:05.109> would<00:04:05.410> be<00:04:05.560> and

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
to battlefield 4 and then would be and

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.420 
to battlefield 4 and then would be and
then<00:04:05.949> we're<00:04:06.040> going<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.220> be<00:04:06.280> playing

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
then we're going to be playing

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.949 
then we're going to be playing
battlefield<00:04:07.000> 4<00:04:07.120> when<00:04:07.329> it's<00:04:07.449> released<00:04:07.690> and

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
battlefield 4 when it's released and

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.140 
battlefield 4 when it's released and
we're<00:04:08.470> not<00:04:08.620> really<00:04:08.919> gonna<00:04:09.099> be<00:04:09.370> going<00:04:09.669> back<00:04:09.910> to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
we're not really gonna be going back to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.089 
we're not really gonna be going back to
battlefield<00:04:10.599> 3<00:04:10.810> unless<00:04:11.079> you<00:04:11.379> know<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.709> title

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
battlefield 3 unless you know that title

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.500 
battlefield 3 unless you know that title
just<00:04:12.280> absolutely<00:04:12.730> sucks<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.209> don't<00:04:13.359> think

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
just absolutely sucks I don't think

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.180 
just absolutely sucks I don't think
that's<00:04:13.569> going<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.780> be<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.989> case<00:04:14.139> so<00:04:14.410> really<00:04:15.160> I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
that's going to be the case so really I

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.759 
that's going to be the case so really I
think<00:04:15.280> dice<00:04:15.699> in<00:04:16.060> my<00:04:16.599> opinion<00:04:16.959> has<00:04:17.289> given<00:04:17.650> us

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
think dice in my opinion has given us

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.490 
think dice in my opinion has given us
everything<00:04:17.919> we<00:04:18.669> could<00:04:19.090> really<00:04:19.299> ask<00:04:19.570> for<00:04:19.989> for

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
everything we could really ask for for

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.260 
everything we could really ask for for
battle<00:04:20.889> for<00:04:21.039> three<00:04:21.250> they've<00:04:21.549> given<00:04:21.729> us<00:04:21.909> a<00:04:22.030> lot

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
battle for three they've given us a lot

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.330 
battle for three they've given us a lot
of<00:04:22.300> content<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.409> think<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:23.919> we're<00:04:24.250> not

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
of content and I think that we're not

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.770 
of content and I think that we're not
going<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.550> get<00:04:24.700> anything<00:04:24.849> else<00:04:25.090> after<00:04:25.300> endgame

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
going to get anything else after endgame

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.910

what<00:05:54.610> I've<00:05:54.700> seen<00:05:54.730> so<00:05:55.090> far<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.870> since<00:05:56.500> seen

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
what I've seen so far and since seen

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.500 
what I've seen so far and since seen
what<00:05:56.920> Treyarch<00:05:57.310> has<00:05:57.340> put<00:05:57.790> into<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.150> game<00:05:58.330> it

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
what Treyarch has put into the game it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.550 
what Treyarch has put into the game it
looks<00:05:58.540> like<00:05:58.810> they're<00:05:58.960> really<00:05:59.110> trying<00:05:59.350> to

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
looks like they're really trying to

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.710 
looks like they're really trying to
freshen<00:05:59.890> things<00:06:00.010> up<00:06:00.280> I'm<00:06:00.820> fairly<00:06:01.570> excited

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
about the game and I'll probably even

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.580 
about the game and I'll probably even
make<00:06:03.730> some<00:06:03.940> videos<00:06:04.060> about<00:06:04.240> it<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:05.260> fact<00:06:05.470> that

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
make some videos about it the fact that

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.020

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
which looks amazing I really wasn't all

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.900

that<00:06:12.850> interested<00:06:13.090> in<00:06:13.600> zombies<00:06:14.380> in<00:06:14.670> black<00:06:15.670> ops

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
that interested in zombies in black ops

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.580 
that interested in zombies in black ops
considering<00:06:16.570> that<00:06:16.990> it<00:06:17.110> just<00:06:17.260> looked<00:06:17.440> like<00:06:17.500> he

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
considering that it just looked like he

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.230 
considering that it just looked like he
just<00:06:17.830> ran<00:06:18.070> around<00:06:18.220> in<00:06:18.520> circles<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.090> that

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
just ran around in circles and that

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.850 
just ran around in circles and that
didn't<00:06:19.450> really<00:06:19.480> appeal<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:19.870> me<00:06:20.020> but<00:06:20.500> now<00:06:20.650> that

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
didn't really appeal to me but now that

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.590 
didn't really appeal to me but now that
it's<00:06:20.980> kind<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.430> like<00:06:21.610> its<00:06:21.760> own<00:06:21.940> fleshed<00:06:22.420> out

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
it's kind of like its own fleshed out

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.270 
it's kind of like its own fleshed out
campaign<00:06:23.170> it<00:06:23.410> looks<00:06:23.560> like<00:06:23.680> you<00:06:23.800> can<00:06:23.950> just<00:06:23.980> kind

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
campaign it looks like you can just kind

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.430 
campaign it looks like you can just kind
of<00:06:24.340> free<00:06:25.210> roam<00:06:25.420> everywhere<00:06:25.600> that<00:06:26.230> looks

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
of free roam everywhere that looks

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.050

while campaigns for first-person

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.990 
while campaigns for first-person
shooters<00:06:32.410> usually<00:06:32.950> feel<00:06:33.160> a<00:06:33.190> little<00:06:33.370> lacking<00:06:33.640> I

was<00:06:34.510> very<00:06:34.540> impressed<00:06:34.870> by<00:06:35.140> the<00:06:35.200> campaign<00:06:35.650> in<00:06:36.130> or

was very impressed by the campaign in or

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.070

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
at least I thought it was fairly decent

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.380 
at least I thought it was fairly decent
in<00:06:38.230> black<00:06:38.830> ops<00:06:39.100> and<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.820> fact<00:06:40.000> that<00:06:40.060> we<00:06:40.210> get

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
in black ops and the fact that we get
