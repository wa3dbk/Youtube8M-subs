00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
this bear costume over here we actually

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.930 
this bear costume over here we actually
got<00:01:48.150> fur<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.340> think<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.760> about

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
got fur I think it was something about

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.460 
got fur I think it was something about
going<00:01:51.240> green<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.780> while<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.260> was<00:01:52.350> pretty

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
going green a while back it was pretty

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
going green a while back it was pretty
much<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.800> same<00:01:52.979> concept<00:01:53.160> as<00:01:53.580> this<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
much the same concept as this one so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.180 
much the same concept as this one so
there<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.840> let's<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.040> looks

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190
