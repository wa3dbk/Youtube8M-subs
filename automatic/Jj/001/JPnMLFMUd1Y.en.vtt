so those of you who've been following my
blog<00:00:03.810> know<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:04.980> I've<00:00:05.130> been<00:00:05.279> moving<00:00:05.460> away

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
blog know that I've been moving away

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.740 
blog know that I've been moving away
from<00:00:07.220> optical<00:00:08.220> systems<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.000> trying<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.510> look

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
from optical systems and trying to look

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.009 
from optical systems and trying to look
at<00:00:09.929> other<00:00:10.170> forms<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:11.240> other<00:00:12.240> methods<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
at other forms of other methods of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.620 
at other forms of other methods of
detecting<00:00:13.440> inputs<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> multi-modal<00:00:15.240> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
detecting inputs for a multi-modal and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.269 
detecting inputs for a multi-modal and
multi-touch<00:00:16.470> hardware<00:00:18.289> so<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.949> days<00:00:20.100> ago

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
multi-touch hardware so two days ago

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.970 
multi-touch hardware so two days ago
three<00:00:20.760> days<00:00:20.850> ago<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.660> bought<00:00:22.350> myself<00:00:22.560> an

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
three days ago really I bought myself an

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.490 
three days ago really I bought myself an
Arduino<00:00:23.640> board<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.519> created<00:00:26.990> this<00:00:27.990> matrix

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
Arduino board and created this matrix

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
Arduino board and created this matrix
that<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.830> see<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.340> pretty<00:00:29.609> simple<00:00:29.880> just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
that you see here is pretty simple just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.220 
that you see here is pretty simple just
two<00:00:30.570> three<00:00:30.869> by<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.080> matrix<00:00:32.149> bi-directional

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
two three by two matrix bi-directional

two three by two matrix bi-directional
LEDs<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.680> trying<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> replicate<00:00:35.570> pawns<00:00:36.570> led

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
LEDs I'm trying to replicate pawns led

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.319 
LEDs I'm trying to replicate pawns led
input<00:00:37.829> detection<00:00:38.340> method<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.570> I've<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.590> my

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
input detection method so I've got my

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.319 
input detection method so I've got my
leds<00:00:42.329> connected<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.160> arduino<00:00:44.730> down<00:00:44.969> here

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
leds connected to my arduino down here

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.029 
leds connected to my arduino down here
just<00:00:45.719> using<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.460> plastic<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.390> shield<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
just using this plastic so to shield it

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
just using this plastic so to shield it
don't<00:00:50.039> cause<00:00:50.309> any<00:00:50.489> short<00:00:50.789> circuits<00:00:50.850> etc<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
don't cause any short circuits etc so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.900 
don't cause any short circuits etc so
this<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.980> metal<00:00:53.129> plate<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.699> bottom

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
this little metal plate at the bottom

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.540 
this little metal plate at the bottom
okay<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.390> basically<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.989> wrote<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> book<00:00:58.550> program

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
okay so basically I wrote a book program

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.180 
okay so basically I wrote a book program
in<00:00:59.760> processing<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.330 

first<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.059> all<00:01:04.089> I<00:01:04.150> wrote<00:01:04.479> my<00:01:04.720> arduino<00:01:05.560> program

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
first of all I wrote my arduino program

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.840 
first of all I wrote my arduino program
in<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:07.060> arduino<00:01:07.540> itself<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.229> then<00:01:09.100> i<00:01:09.130> wrote<00:01:09.640> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
in the arduino itself and then i wrote a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.649 
in the arduino itself and then i wrote a
pro<00:01:10.180> in<00:01:10.390> processing<00:01:10.930> i<00:01:10.990> just<00:01:11.170> wrote<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.380> up<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
pro in processing i just wrote it up to

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.140 
pro in processing i just wrote it up to
show<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:15.190> inputs<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.330> what<00:01:16.509> how<00:01:17.409> they<00:01:17.619> behave

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
show the inputs and what how they behave

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.430 
show the inputs and what how they behave
when<00:01:19.150> an<00:01:19.509> input<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.409> detected<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:23.049> we<00:01:23.350> can

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
when an input is detected so as we can

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.190 
when an input is detected so as we can
see<00:01:23.500> when<00:01:23.799> we<00:01:23.890> go<00:01:24.070> over<00:01:24.100> an<00:01:24.490> input<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.690> turns<00:01:26.049> to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
see when we go over an input it turns to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.670 
see when we go over an input it turns to
blue<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.509> its<00:01:28.659> detection<00:01:28.990> I've<00:01:29.380> got<00:01:29.649> a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
blue that so its detection I've got a

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.389 
blue that so its detection I've got a
threshold<00:01:30.220> level<00:01:30.520> that<00:01:30.610> I've<00:01:30.759> set<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.979> detect

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
threshold level that I've set to detect

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.870 
threshold level that I've set to detect
it<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:35.049> can<00:01:35.200> go<00:01:35.350> over<00:01:35.440> multiple

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
it we can go over multiple

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.880 
it we can go over multiple
inputs<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.210> detect<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.140 

and<00:01:43.280> cover<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.729> entire<00:01:43.790> thing

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.500 

so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
so

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.990 
so
effect<00:01:50.230> as<00:01:50.380> an<00:01:51.040> experiment<00:01:51.550> this<00:01:51.730> works

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
effect as an experiment this works

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200 
effect as an experiment this works
really<00:01:52.270> effectively<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:54.160> terms<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.940> being

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
really effectively but in terms of being

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.370 
really effectively but in terms of being
utilized<00:01:55.750> for<00:01:56.080> an<00:01:56.650> actual<00:01:57.640> input<00:01:58.380> detection

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
utilized for an actual input detection

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.510 
utilized for an actual input detection
method<00:02:00.120> for<00:02:01.120> any<00:02:01.900> project<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:03.070> would<00:02:03.190> say<00:02:03.370> this

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
method for any project I would say this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.990 
method for any project I would say this
is<00:02:03.730> far<00:02:04.030> from<00:02:04.060> complete<00:02:04.650> first<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.890> all<00:02:06.000> right

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
is far from complete first of all right

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.030 
is far from complete first of all right
now<00:02:07.150> I'm<00:02:07.510> interfacing<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.320> directly<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.920> an

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
now I'm interfacing this directly to an

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.910 
now I'm interfacing this directly to an
Arduino<00:02:09.690> ideally<00:02:10.690> if<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.899> wanted<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.500> make

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
Arduino ideally if you wanted to make

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.980 
Arduino ideally if you wanted to make
this<00:02:12.130> large<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:13.000> larger<00:02:13.330> scale<00:02:13.600> you'd<00:02:13.810> have

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
this large in a larger scale you'd have

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.460 
this large in a larger scale you'd have
to<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:16.000> secondary<00:02:16.510> connects<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
to have a secondary connects to the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.980 
to have a secondary connects to the
secondary<00:02:18.010> board<00:02:18.430> which<00:02:19.270> connects<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.870> an

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
secondary board which connects to an

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.190 
secondary board which connects to an
Arduino<00:02:20.620> where<00:02:20.950> your<00:02:21.460> LEDs<00:02:21.970> are<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.600> your

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
Arduino where your LEDs are on your

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200 
Arduino where your LEDs are on your
secondary<00:02:23.650> board<00:02:24.010> itself<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.730> have<00:02:24.970> like

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
secondary board itself so you have like

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.240 
secondary board itself so you have like
an<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.800> LED<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.160> connected<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:28.770> 2d<00:02:29.770> which<00:02:30.130> is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
an the LED is connected to a 2d which is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.000 
an the LED is connected to a 2d which is
connected<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:31.150> an<00:02:31.300> Arduino<00:02:31.690> using<00:02:32.140> serial

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
connected to an Arduino using serial

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.530 
connected to an Arduino using serial
peripheral<00:02:33.370> interface<00:02:33.520> or<00:02:34.090> something<00:02:34.420> like

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
peripheral interface or something like

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.480 
peripheral interface or something like
that<00:02:34.600> but<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:37.120> an<00:02:37.590> experiment<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:39.220> works

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
that but for an experiment it works

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.530 
that but for an experiment it works
pretty<00:02:39.940> effectively<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.840> found<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:42.270> like<00:02:43.270> all

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
pretty effectively I found that like all

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.800 
pretty effectively I found that like all
