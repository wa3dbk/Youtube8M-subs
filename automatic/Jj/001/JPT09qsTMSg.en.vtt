00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it pretty much just unclip itself just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:15.120 
it pretty much just unclip itself just
like<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:03.830> there<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:07.610> there<00:01:11.270> okay

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
so now we have the display now where I

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.310 
so now we have the display now where I
cracked<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.860> believe<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.549> on<00:01:24.729> this<00:01:24.970> side

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
cracked it I believe it's on this side

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.399 
cracked it I believe it's on this side
but<00:01:26.320> until<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:26.680> get<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.009> apart<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.990> all<00:01:29.229> they

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
but until I get it apart then all they

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.080 
but until I get it apart then all they
have<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.710> do<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.130> flip<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.520> over<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:33.090> you've

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
have to do is flip it over and you've

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.529 
have to do is flip it over and you've
got<00:01:34.299> these<00:01:34.420> metal<00:01:34.659> tabs<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.530> Bend<00:01:39.330> all<00:01:40.330> you

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:57.500 
got these metal tabs that Bend all you
have<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.780> do<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.049> straighten<00:01:41.289> them<00:01:41.500> out

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.370 

now<00:01:58.510> this<00:01:58.780> should<00:01:59.110> just<00:01:59.380> we<00:01:59.860> go<00:02:00.010> up

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.750 

okay<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.440> I've<00:02:14.560> wiggled<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> out<00:02:17.760> here's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
okay now that I've wiggled it out here's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.450 
okay now that I've wiggled it out here's
your<00:02:18.910> screen<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.160> there's<00:02:21.160> your<00:02:21.340> little

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
your screen and there's your little

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.820 
your screen and there's your little
connector<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.990> like<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> rubber<00:02:23.710> or

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
connector it's like a rubber or

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.260 
connector it's like a rubber or
something<00:02:25.620> now<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> little<00:02:27.760> tricky<00:02:28.180> to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
something now this is a little tricky to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.050 
something now this is a little tricky to
get<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.600> without<00:02:28.830> breaking<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.250> oh<00:02:30.430> there

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
get out without breaking it oh there

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.420 
get out without breaking it oh there
goes<00:02:31.300> because<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.380> get<00:02:32.500> glass<00:02:32.770> on<00:02:33.070> metal

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
goes because you get glass on metal

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.990 
goes because you get glass on metal
pretty<00:02:33.670> much<00:02:33.880> there<00:02:34.270> we<00:02:34.480> go<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.340> oh<00:02:36.580> it's<00:02:36.850> on

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
pretty much there we go so oh it's on

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.170 
pretty much there we go so oh it's on
this<00:02:37.150> side<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.720> mine<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:39.150> barely

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.740 

where<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.300> chipped<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.450> little

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
where it's chipped it was just a little

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.780 
where it's chipped it was just a little
chip<00:02:47.170> off<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.800> but<00:02:48.040> it's<00:02:48.190> enough<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.610> lose

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
chip off of it but it's enough to lose

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.810 
chip off of it but it's enough to lose
the<00:02:48.970> connection<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.530> rubber<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:54.100> pulls

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
the connection so that rubber just pulls

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.980 
the connection so that rubber just pulls
off<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.820> there's<00:02:58.030> where<00:02:58.240> it's<00:02:58.390> broken<00:02:58.600> and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
off and there's where it's broken and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.050 
off and there's where it's broken and
that's<00:02:59.230> enough<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.590> screw<00:03:00.190> up<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.490> display

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
that's enough to screw up the display

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.990 
that's enough to screw up the display
just<00:03:01.360> dropped<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.560> from<00:03:02.800> about<00:03:03.160> three<00:03:03.490> feet<00:03:03.730> in

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
just dropped it from about three feet in

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.550 
just dropped it from about three feet in
the<00:03:04.900> case<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:06.250> cracked<00:03:06.460> it<00:03:07.710> nice<00:03:08.710> huh<00:03:10.560> so

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
the case and that cracked it nice huh so

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
the case and that cracked it nice huh so
here's<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.950> new<00:03:12.070> display<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:13.450> got<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.630> film

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
here's the new display it's got a film

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.729 
here's the new display it's got a film
on<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:15.450> peel<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.600> off<00:03:19.230> I've<00:03:20.230> got<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.590> new

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
on it peel it off I've got the new

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.910 
on it peel it off I've got the new
rubber

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.300 

as<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.700> try<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.910> make<00:03:28.120> sure<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.510> even<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
as you try to make sure it's even and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.620 
as you try to make sure it's even and
then<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.800> one<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.160> has<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.640> more<00:03:36.880> clips<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
then the one that has the more clips the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.610 
then the one that has the more clips the
more<00:03:37.840> metal<00:03:38.050> is<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:40.209> side<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.020> rubber

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
more metal is the side that the rubber

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.470 
more metal is the side that the rubber
goes<00:03:41.890> into<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.580> of<00:03:42.730> course<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.120> needs<00:03:43.270> to

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
goes into because of course it needs to

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.590 
goes into because of course it needs to
hold<00:03:43.660> more<00:03:44.110> even<00:03:44.410> pressure<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:48.600> carefully

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
hold more even pressure so carefully

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.300 
hold more even pressure so carefully
drop<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:50.050> down<00:03:51.450> line<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.690> up<00:03:53.819> okay<00:03:56.310> watch

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
drop that down line that up okay watch

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.190 
drop that down line that up okay watch
this<00:03:57.580> dust<00:03:57.849> fall<00:03:58.269> apart<00:03:58.630> because<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:59.050> will

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
this dust fall apart because this will

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.020 
this dust fall apart because this will
just<00:03:59.319> come<00:03:59.530> flying<00:03:59.860> right<00:03:59.980> off<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.760> would<00:04:06.880> be<00:04:07.000> a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
just come flying right off it would be a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:16.920 
just come flying right off it would be a
