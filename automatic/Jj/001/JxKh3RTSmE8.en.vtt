the ipod and see it will play just a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.820 
the ipod and see it will play just a
little<00:02:52.960> bit<00:02:53.050> that's<00:02:53.140> amusing<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.710> so<00:02:53.770> you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
systems for the iphone but this is the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.900 
systems for the iphone but this is the
first<00:03:02.290> one<00:03:02.650> that's<00:03:02.800> actually<00:03:03.220> enclosed<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.820> i

can<00:03:04.090> tell<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.270> guys<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.510> actually<00:03:04.870> plays<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
can tell you guys that actually plays a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.420 
can tell you guys that actually plays a
very<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:07.300> in<00:03:07.900> comparison<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.830> other

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
very well in comparison to the other

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.880 
very well in comparison to the other
devices<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.000> i<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.390> I'll<00:03:11.200> just<00:03:11.410> grab<00:03:11.560> some

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
devices that i have I'll just grab some

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:26.700 
devices that i have I'll just grab some
music<00:03:12.190> here

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.440 

so<00:03:27.710> it<00:03:27.770> actually<00:03:27.890> plays<00:03:28.130> pretty<00:03:28.580> nicely<00:03:28.820> it

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
so it actually plays pretty nicely it

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.480 
so it actually plays pretty nicely it
does<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.870> little<00:03:30.530> bit<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.740> bass<00:03:30.950> actually

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
does have a little bit of bass actually

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.430 
does have a little bit of bass actually
in<00:03:32.000> comparison<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.690> other<00:03:32.870> devices<00:03:33.230> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
in comparison to the other devices that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.850 
in comparison to the other devices that
I've<00:03:33.650> been<00:03:33.770> using<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:35.330> very<00:03:35.720> loud<00:03:36.080> as<00:03:36.800> you

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
I've been using it's very loud as you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.380 
I've been using it's very loud as you
can<00:03:36.950> tell<00:03:37.160> that's<00:03:37.340> actually<00:03:37.640> on<00:03:37.760> half<00:03:37.970> setting

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
can tell that's actually on half setting

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.390 
can tell that's actually on half setting
it<00:03:39.170> can<00:03:39.380> get<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.560> lot<00:03:39.770> louder<00:03:39.920> than<00:03:40.250> that

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
it can get a lot louder than that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.700 
it can get a lot louder than that
obviously<00:03:41.300> if<00:03:41.390> you're<00:03:41.510> outside<00:03:41.660> if<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.560> want

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
obviously if you're outside if you want

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.660 
obviously if you're outside if you want
to<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.920> know<00:03:43.010> play<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.220> little<00:03:43.370> bit<00:03:43.550> louder

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
to you know play a little bit louder

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.880 
to you know play a little bit louder
music<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.180> can<00:03:44.300> definitely<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.660> do<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:44.960> it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
music you can definitely can do that it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.340 
music you can definitely can do that it
has<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.250> good<00:03:46.880> amount<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.270> base<00:03:47.510> like<00:03:48.170> what

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
has a good amount of base like what

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.680 
has a good amount of base like what
comparison<00:03:48.890> honest<00:03:49.130> honestly<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.060> set<00:03:50.600> of

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
comparison honest honestly to a set of

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.080 
comparison honest honestly to a set of
radius<00:03:51.080> headphones<00:03:51.470> about<00:03:52.220> about<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.940> same

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
radius headphones about about the same

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.220 
radius headphones about about the same
amount<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.330> base<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.810> would<00:03:53.930> get<00:03:54.050> from

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
amount of base that you would get from

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.930 
amount of base that you would get from
those<00:03:54.470> if<00:03:54.740> you've<00:03:55.190> actually<00:03:55.340> used<00:03:55.760> those
