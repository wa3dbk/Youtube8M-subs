we<00:00:13.110> live<00:00:13.410> under<00:00:13.590> extreme<00:00:14.099> conditions<00:00:14.269> today

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
we live under extreme conditions today

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.359 
we live under extreme conditions today
the<00:00:15.480> extreme<00:00:15.900> condition<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.890> heat<00:00:17.130> is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the extreme condition is the heat is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.779 
the extreme condition is the heat is
very<00:00:17.970> very<00:00:18.449> hot<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.560> rotation<00:00:19.920> number<00:00:20.490> is

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
very very hot and it rotation number is

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.170 
very very hot and it rotation number is
very<00:00:21.300> important<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.500> let's<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:22.949> inside<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
will show you how to get water to these

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.450 
will show you how to get water to these
guys<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.279> inside<00:00:29.810> my<00:00:30.810> friend

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
guys so here we are inside my friend

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
guys so here we are inside my friend
logically<00:00:32.460> i<00:00:33.739> will<00:00:34.739> show<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.520> other

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
logically i will show you all the other

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.319 
logically i will show you all the other
parts<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.710> through<00:00:38.329> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
parts that we have to go through the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
parts that we have to go through the
water<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.870> board<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.469> how<00:00:40.649> better

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
water on board so how better

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.510 
water on board so how better
understanding<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.360> process<00:00:43.340> first<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
understanding of the process first of

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
understanding of the process first of
all<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.829> water<00:00:47.070> maker<00:00:47.430> itself<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
all here is the water maker itself is a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.439 
all here is the water maker itself is a
spectra<00:00:49.730> that<00:00:50.989> from<00:00:51.989> comes<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> pressure<00:00:52.710> on

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
spectra that from comes the pressure on

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
spectra that from comes the pressure on
here<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> word<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> filter<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
here we have a word of the filter and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.930 
here we have a word of the filter and
the<00:00:56.460> engines<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.340> one<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> filters

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the engines this is one of the filters

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.420 
the engines this is one of the filters
this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> spare<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.309> in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this is a spare one we have this one in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.520 
this is a spare one we have this one in
case<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.899> gets<00:01:04.280> with<00:01:05.280> bad<00:01:05.729> water<00:01:06.030> or

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
case that one gets with bad water or

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
case that one gets with bad water or
something<00:01:07.530> we'll<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> change<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:09.110> then

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
something we'll have to change it then

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.850 
something we'll have to change it then
here<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.250> evolved<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:13.500> check<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
here we have evolved to to check the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640 
here we have evolved to to check the
pressure<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.630> at<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> beginning<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.350> have

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
pressure on so at the beginning we have

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.149 
pressure on so at the beginning we have
that<00:01:16.799> ball<00:01:17.070> open<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> water<00:01:19.650> flow

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that ball open to to make the water flow

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.760 
that ball open to to make the water flow
so<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> clean<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.479> whole<00:01:21.630> system<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.320> then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so we clean the whole system and then

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.590 
so we clean the whole system and then
when<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.070> ready<00:01:23.280> after<00:01:23.610> five<00:01:23.880> minutes<00:01:24.090> which

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
when it's ready after five minutes which

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.850 
when it's ready after five minutes which
is<00:01:24.630> closed<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:26.210> another<00:01:27.210> water<00:01:27.530> start<00:01:28.530> going

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
is closed it another water start going

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.660 
is closed it another water start going
into<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.990> two<00:01:31.110> options<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.250> put<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
into we have two options we can put it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.850 
into we have two options we can put it
in<00:01:32.729> test<00:01:33.090> mode<00:01:34.100> we<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.130> put<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.520> test<00:01:35.790> mode<00:01:36.860> or

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
in test mode we can put in test mode or

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
in test mode we can put in test mode or
we<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> tank<00:01:38.900> we<00:01:39.900> put<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
we can put it to the tank we put it to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.630 
we can put it to the tank we put it to
the<00:01:40.290> tank<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.820> straight<00:01:42.090> there

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
the tank it's going to go straight there

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.980 
the tank it's going to go straight there
this<00:01:44.640> tank<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.750> hold<00:01:46.079> 40<00:01:46.649> 2<00:01:46.799> liters<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
this tank can hold 40 2 liters and and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.340 
this tank can hold 40 2 liters and and
takes<00:01:49.590> approximately<00:01:50.579> 50<00:01:51.180> minute<00:01:51.479> 55<00:01:52.020> minutes

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
takes approximately 50 minute 55 minutes

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.030 
takes approximately 50 minute 55 minutes
to<00:01:52.470> fill<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.659> how<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.829> need

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
to fill it up how do we know if we need

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.970 
to fill it up how do we know if we need
water<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.430> more<00:01:56.729> basically<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.899> human<00:01:58.350> alarm

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
water or more basically by human alarm

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.550 
water or more basically by human alarm
and<00:02:00.250> in<00:02:00.430> what<00:02:00.550> else<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:01.000> cool<00:02:01.440> that's<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and in what else is cool that's the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.100 
and in what else is cool that's the
moment<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:03.100> need<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.580> do<00:02:03.700> whatever<00:02:03.940> we<00:02:04.930> have<00:02:04.960> to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
moment I need to do whatever we have to

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.620 
moment I need to do whatever we have to
entrance<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:06.070> water<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.790> system<00:02:07.360> for<00:02:07.570> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
entrance of water to the system for the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.740 
entrance of water to the system for the
water<00:02:07.840> maker<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:08.830> because<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:10.540> boats

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
water maker and that's because the boats

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.450 
water maker and that's because the boats
heal<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.410> lot<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.710> boat<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.280> heal

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
heal a lot so so if the boat is to heal

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.010 
heal a lot so so if the boat is to heal
up<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:16.030> only<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.390> one<00:02:16.600> we're<00:02:16.900> not<00:02:16.990> going

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
up and we only have one we're not going

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.960 
up and we only have one we're not going
to<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.290> able<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.590> put<00:02:17.770> water<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.580> system

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
to be able to put water into the system

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.750 
to be able to put water into the system
so<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.270> always<00:02:19.600> down<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.830> sickle<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.610> is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
so we always down to the sickle that is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.200 
so we always down to the sickle that is
a<00:02:21.810> newer<00:02:22.810> side<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.070> case<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.820> mean
