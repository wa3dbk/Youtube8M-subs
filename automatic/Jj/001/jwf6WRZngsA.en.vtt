00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 here in the gta by the social club of

 rockstar now instead of 300 members 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.969
 which was a limitation we had been 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.050
 for a thousand members, that's it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 Something else I wanted to say to you. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.300
 you guys to add the clan that I 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.750
 I'll leave it in the description link so that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.610
 You can enter what's the way it is. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.640
 released just click there and enter already 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.739
 We have 431 members at this time, so far 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.369
 shows that we have more than the limit 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 standard would then have 300 initial're 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.200
 worth the new form of the rockstar of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 let a thousand people be good to be 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.210
 added even created with a 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.710
 deficit if you want to participate in live 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.420
 not sometimes I can not 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.049
 add everyone's face for the simple 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.060
 fact that is is totally psn 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.670
 disclosed but if you enter by clan 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.100
 bks da tu there is a plan which a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 friend some friends and subscribers 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.939
 they created you will be able to play because 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.860
 at the time that I 'm going to do there and I'm going 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.530
 in the clan 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.560
