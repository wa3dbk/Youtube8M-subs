00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
derailleur will miss shift is due to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.790 
derailleur will miss shift is due to
lack<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.880> cable<00:00:30.390> tension<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.619> pull

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
lack of cable tension if you can pull

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790 
lack of cable tension if you can pull
your<00:00:31.890> cable<00:00:32.310> down<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:33.030> far<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> easiest

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
your cable down that far the easiest

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
your cable down that far the easiest
thing<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.400> just<00:00:35.550> add<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:36.060> cable

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
thing to do is just add a little cable

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360 
thing to do is just add a little cable
tension<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.440> first<00:00:37.680> thing<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.220> do

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
tension the first thing that you can do

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.550 
tension the first thing that you can do
is<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.030> barrel<00:00:39.330> adjuster<00:00:39.810> which<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
is use your barrel adjuster which is

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.250 
is use your barrel adjuster which is
here<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.100> shifter<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:41.970> many<00:00:42.780> times<00:00:43.020> will

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
here on your shifter or many times will

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.720 
here on your shifter or many times will
be<00:00:43.380> here<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:43.920> derailleur<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:46.730> turning

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
be here on your derailleur and turning

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
be here on your derailleur and turning
the<00:00:47.820> barrel<00:00:48.060> adjuster<00:00:48.150> clockwise<00:00:48.720> will<00:00:49.710> add

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the barrel adjuster clockwise will add

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.720 
the barrel adjuster clockwise will add
cable<00:00:50.820> tension<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.920> continue<00:00:53.310> to<00:00:53.550> add

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
cable tension so you can continue to add

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510 
cable tension so you can continue to add
cable<00:00:54.420> tension<00:00:54.750> until<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.740> bicycle<00:00:56.130> shifts

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
cable tension until the bicycle shifts

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.810 
cable tension until the bicycle shifts
appropriately<00:00:57.150> or<00:00:57.330> however<00:00:57.900> you<00:00:57.990> like<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.820> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
appropriately or however you like it so

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
give that a shot looks like that's a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.660 
give that a shot looks like that's a
little<00:01:03.060> bit<00:01:03.210> too<00:01:03.480> high<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.550> turn

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
little bit too high now so you can turn

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
little bit too high now so you can turn
the<00:01:05.820> barrel<00:01:06.030> adjuster<00:01:06.150> counterclockwise<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the barrel adjuster counterclockwise to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.430 
the barrel adjuster counterclockwise to
release<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.550> cable<00:01:08.850> tension<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:13.170> looks

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
release some cable tension that looks

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.170 
release some cable tension that looks
good<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.950> there

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
good right there

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.900 
good right there
many<00:01:15.600> times<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:17.250> cause<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
many times what can also cause the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.640 
many times what can also cause the
derailleur<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.330> shift<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.900> properly<00:01:19.260> is<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
derailleur to shift and properly is a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.080 
derailleur to shift and properly is a
bent<00:01:19.920> derailleur<00:01:20.280> hanger<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.730> we'll<00:01:20.910> cover

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
bent derailleur hanger which we'll cover

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.660 
bent derailleur hanger which we'll cover
later<00:01:21.650> again<00:01:22.650> another<00:01:22.980> thing<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> cause

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
later again another thing that can cause

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.190 
later again another thing that can cause
your<00:01:23.910> derailleur<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.450> shift<00:01:24.660> improperly

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
your derailleur to shift improperly

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.290 
your derailleur to shift improperly
would<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.650> two<00:01:25.950> short<00:01:26.250> lengths<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.150> cable

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
would be two short lengths of cable

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.170 
would be two short lengths of cable
housing<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:28.830> two<00:01:28.890> long<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.550> it's<00:01:29.700> way<00:01:29.940> out

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
housing or also two long if it's way out

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
housing or also two long if it's way out
and<00:01:30.420> curvy<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.080> lot<00:01:31.230> of<00:01:31.260> cable<00:01:31.650> has<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.950> pull

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and curvy and a lot of cable has to pull

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.600 
and curvy and a lot of cable has to pull
through<00:01:32.340> there

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
through there

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.000 
through there
it<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.180> hung<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.570> inside<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.380> not

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
it can get hung up inside there and not

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.830 
it can get hung up inside there and not
shift<00:01:35.310> properly<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.600> too

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
shift properly and also if it's too

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.649 
shift properly and also if it's too
short<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> cable<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.550> kind<00:01:39.510> of

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
short then the cable will be kind of

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
short then the cable will be kind of
trying<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> pull<00:01:40.590> itself<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
trying to pull itself out of the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.680 
trying to pull itself out of the
derailleur<00:01:42.120> because<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.870> so<00:01:43.050> short

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
derailleur because it's so short

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.210 
derailleur because it's so short
another<00:01:45.690> quick<00:01:46.050> fix<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.040> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
another quick fix that you can do is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.030 
another quick fix that you can do is
also<00:01:47.940> if<00:01:48.150> your<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.900> bike<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.800> little

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
also if your if your bike is a little

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
also if your if your bike is a little
bit<00:01:50.130> older<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.550> may<00:01:50.760> or<00:01:50.880> may<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.330> barrel

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
bit older it may or may not have barrel

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
bit older it may or may not have barrel
adjusters<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> can't<00:01:53.190> seem<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.430> find

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
adjusters so if you can't seem to find

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
adjusters so if you can't seem to find
one<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> those<00:01:54.180> either<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> handlebar<00:01:55.560> or

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
one of those either on the handlebar or

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.780
