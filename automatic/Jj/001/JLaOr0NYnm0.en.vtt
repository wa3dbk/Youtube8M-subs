00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.420 
photocell and the light a midi signal is
sent<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> modulate<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.970> computer<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
sent to modulate on the computer a

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.039 
sent to modulate on the computer a
program<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.729> bottom<00:01:57.060> cell<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> pause<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
program the bottom cell to pause the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.550 
program the bottom cell to pause the
video<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.299> then<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.630> middle<00:02:00.869> cell<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
video and then the middle cell is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.810 
video and then the middle cell is
programmed<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.700> play<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.189> top<00:02:05.189> cell<00:02:05.549> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
programmed to play it in the top cell is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.700 
programmed to play it in the top cell is
programmed<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.990> advance<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.430 

so<00:02:10.370> when<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.000> ball<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.210> at<00:02:11.510> rest<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.170> video

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so when the ball is at rest the video

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.840 
so when the ball is at rest the video
should<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.710> paused<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:14.570> then<00:02:15.520> using<00:02:16.520> my

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
should be paused and then using my

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.170 
should be paused and then using my
concentration<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.960> can<00:02:18.890> play<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.460> change<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
concentration I can play and change the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.490 
concentration I can play and change the
video<00:02:20.330> at<00:02:20.660> will<00:02:21.160> hands-free<00:02:23.050> using<00:02:24.050> only<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
video at will hands-free using only the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.450
