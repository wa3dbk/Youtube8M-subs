00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
like in the key of how about see when I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.230 
like in the key of how about see when I
switch<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.900> camera<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> could<00:00:16.880> get<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.000> close

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
switch this camera I could get up close

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.359 
switch this camera I could get up close
and<00:00:20.510> my<00:00:21.510> zoom<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.769> scooting<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.160> chair

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and my zoom is just scooting a chair

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.150 
and my zoom is just scooting a chair
forward<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.300> backwards<00:00:24.960> anyway<00:00:25.680> here's<00:00:26.070> some

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
forward and backwards anyway here's some

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.490 
forward and backwards anyway here's some
country<00:00:26.699> Hank<00:00:27.660> Williams<00:00:28.080> style<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.800> see

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.140 

you<00:00:36.500> ever<00:00:36.680> take<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:36.890> C<00:00:37.220> chord<00:00:37.490> hit<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.940> bass

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
you ever take a C chord hit the bass

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.010 
you ever take a C chord hit the bass
note<00:00:38.540> which<00:00:38.780> is<00:00:38.810> C<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:40.550> strum<00:00:41.120> down<00:00:43.810> pick<00:00:44.810> that

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
note which is C and strum down pick that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.820 
note which is C and strum down pick that
bass<00:00:45.290> note<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.930> strum<00:00:48.320> down

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
bass note and strum down

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.430 
bass note and strum down
so<00:00:48.950> that's<00:00:49.100> your<00:00:49.370> fifth<00:00:49.940> string<00:00:50.440> pressing

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
so that's your fifth string pressing

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.960 
so that's your fifth string pressing
down<00:00:51.590> third<00:00:51.950> fret<00:00:54.580> then<00:00:55.580> you<00:00:55.640> get<00:00:55.790> your

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
down third fret then you get your

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.090 
down third fret then you get your
alternate<00:00:56.600> bass<00:00:56.840> note<00:00:57.170> which<00:00:57.470> is<00:00:57.850> G<00:00:59.860> that's<00:01:00.860> on

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
alternate bass note which is G that's on

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.390 
alternate bass note which is G that's on
the<00:01:01.370> 6th<00:01:01.760> string<00:01:02.090> 3rd<00:01:02.150> fret<00:01:02.510> pick<00:01:03.320> that<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
the 6th string 3rd fret pick that and

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.160 
the 6th string 3rd fret pick that and
strum

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
strum

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.260 
strum
so<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.890> just<00:01:07.190> have<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.490> be<00:01:07.610> able<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.790> hop<00:01:08.030> your

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
so you just have to be able to hop your

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
so you just have to be able to hop your
ring<00:01:08.450> finger<00:01:08.840> back<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.260> forth

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:34.870 

I<00:01:24.530> dig<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.810 

so<00:01:35.880> let's<00:01:36.030> say<00:01:36.240> C<00:01:36.300> is<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.900> rut<00:01:37.110> let's<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so let's say C is the rut let's go to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.410 
so let's say C is the rut let's go to
what<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> call<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:40.200> fourth<00:01:40.610> that's<00:01:41.610> F<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
what we call the fourth that's F in the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.620 
what we call the fourth that's F in the
key<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> C<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.230> fourth<00:01:43.760> note<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> scale<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
key of C the fourth note in the scale is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.130 
key of C the fourth note in the scale is
f<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.440> call<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:47.280> F<00:01:47.430> chord

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
f so we call the F chord

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.789 
f so we call the F chord
the<00:01:49.140> fourth<00:01:49.500> chord<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.580> got<00:01:50.700> your<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:52.040> dr4

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.279 

which<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.609> totally<00:01:57.060> normal<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.990> change

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
which is a totally normal kind of change

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.760 
which is a totally normal kind of change
to<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.740> chord<00:01:59.310> change<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.420> let's<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.109> a<00:02:01.409> bass

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to do chord change but let's do a bass

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.249 
to do chord change but let's do a bass
note<00:02:01.799> run<00:02:02.490> let's<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:03.179> this<00:02:03.390> sound<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
note run let's make this sound so you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.289 
note run let's make this sound so you
can<00:02:04.409> totally<00:02:04.770> hear<00:02:05.130> where<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:06.000> check

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
can totally hear where it's going check

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.919 
can totally hear where it's going check
it<00:02:06.479> out

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.350 

so<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.099> little<00:02:12.400> walk<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.329> a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
so that little walk it's like a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.569 
so that little walk it's like a
stair-step<00:02:13.780> sound<00:02:14.439> you<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.709> walk<00:02:15.250> right<00:02:15.280> up

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
stair-step sound you just walk right up

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:24.960 
stair-step sound you just walk right up
the<00:02:15.700> stairs<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.450> scale<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.569> that's<00:02:20.280> D<00:02:21.989> F<00:02:23.970> C

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the stairs up the scale and that's D F C

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.640 
the stairs up the scale and that's D F C
is<00:02:25.360> third<00:02:26.049> fret<00:02:26.519> fifth<00:02:27.519> string<00:02:28.200> D<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.470> open

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
is third fret fifth string D is open

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.979 
is third fret fifth string D is open
fourth<00:02:30.189> string<00:02:30.299> E<00:02:31.379> is<00:02:32.489> second<00:02:33.489> fret<00:02:33.989> fourth

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
fourth string E is second fret fourth

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.979 
fourth string E is second fret fourth
string<00:02:35.760> F<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:37.799> third<00:02:38.799> fret<00:02:39.159> fourth<00:02:39.609> string<00:02:39.989> and

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
string F is third fret fourth string and

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.949 
string F is third fret fourth string and
that's<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.470> bass<00:02:41.650> note<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.220> your<00:02:42.790> F<00:02:42.940> chord<00:02:42.970> so

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.330 
and then on your F chord you can do
alternating<00:02:58.000> bass<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.420> -<00:02:58.660> or<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.870> go<00:02:58.959> bass

so<00:03:36.060> get<00:03:36.329> really<00:03:36.629> good<00:03:36.870> hay<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.890> from<00:03:38.099> C<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.459> F

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:38.969 
so get really good hay going from C to F

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.289 
so get really good hay going from C to F
and<00:03:39.650> then<00:03:40.650> F<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:41.159> C<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.700> we<00:03:41.909> just<00:03:42.090> use<00:03:42.269> that

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
and then F to C and we just use that
