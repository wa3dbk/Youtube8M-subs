00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
those types of things so I thought the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
those types of things so I thought the
13-inch<00:00:39.149> macbook<00:00:39.960> air<00:00:40.170> would<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> better<00:00:40.710> a

you<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.060> i

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you that you can get for this so i

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.429 
you that you can get for this so i
probably<00:01:24.330> will<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.659> picking<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.110> within

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
probably will be picking that up within

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
probably will be picking that up within
the<00:01:25.619> next<00:01:25.740> few<00:01:25.979> weeks<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:27.060> enough<00:01:27.360> talking

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
this thing cut open I know this has been

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.920

open up this little film there and that

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.849 
open up this little film there and that
is<00:04:06.840> pretty<00:04:07.229> much<00:04:07.469> it<00:04:08.659> very<00:04:09.659> very<00:04:09.900> thin<00:04:10.259> thing

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
is pretty much it very very thin thing

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.279 
is pretty much it very very thin thing
is<00:04:10.979> very<00:04:11.219> lightweight<00:04:11.459> definitely

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:12.289 
is very lightweight definitely

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.509 
is very lightweight definitely
lightweight<00:04:13.289> compared<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.709> my<00:04:13.799> 15<00:04:14.129> inch<00:04:14.250> pro

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
lightweight compared to my 15 inch pro

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.529 
lightweight compared to my 15 inch pro
so<00:04:14.879> let's<00:04:15.000> go<00:04:15.090> ahead<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.239> get<00:04:15.359> this<00:04:15.479> thing

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:15.539 
so let's go ahead and get this thing

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:20.840 
so let's go ahead and get this thing
powered<00:04:16.019> on

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.400 

hopefully<00:04:21.240> we've<00:04:21.390> got<00:04:21.510> enough<00:04:21.750> juice<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:22.110> kind

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
hopefully we've got enough juice to kind

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.740 
hopefully we've got enough juice to kind
of<00:04:22.500> get<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.770> thing<00:04:22.950> going<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.300> startup

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
of get this thing going so to startup

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.930 
of get this thing going so to startup
chime<00:04:25.100> let's<00:04:26.100> kind<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.340> turn<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.790> can

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
chime let's kind of turn this you can

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.330 
chime let's kind of turn this you can
see<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.560> know<00:04:28.560> apples<00:04:28.920> does<00:04:29.100> state<00:04:29.310> that

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
see it I know apples does state that

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.180 
see it I know apples does state that
this<00:04:29.550> has<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.900> instant<00:04:30.900> on<00:04:31.080> but<00:04:31.800> will<00:04:31.980> kind<00:04:32.130> of

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
this has a instant on but will kind of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.320 
this has a instant on but will kind of
see<00:04:32.310> how<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.580> goes<00:04:32.610> i've<00:04:32.940> never<00:04:33.090> had<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
see how that goes i've never had a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.880 
see how that goes i've never had a
computer<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.840> has<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> solid<00:04:34.380> state<00:04:34.680> drive

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
computer that has a solid state drive

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.340 
computer that has a solid state drive
before<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.970> that'll<00:04:36.660> be<00:04:36.720> interesting<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:37.230> see

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
before so that'll be interesting to see

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.440 
before so that'll be interesting to see
how<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.650> works<00:04:37.800> out<00:04:38.100> I<00:04:38.430> know<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.330> probably

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
how that works out I know this probably

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.910 
how that works out I know this probably
will<00:04:39.720> take<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.930> little<00:04:40.230> bit<00:04:40.380> of<00:04:40.440> time<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> boot

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
will take a little bit of time to boot

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.530 
will take a little bit of time to boot
up<00:04:41.010> on<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.370> first<00:04:41.520> time<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:42.090> because<00:04:42.240> you're

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
up on the first time just because you're

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.330 
up on the first time just because you're
got<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.350> go<00:04:43.410> through<00:04:43.560> all<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.740> setup<00:04:44.010> prompts

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
got to go through all the setup prompts

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.360 
got to go through all the setup prompts
and<00:04:44.460> those<00:04:44.550> types<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.880> things<00:04:46.370> this

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
and those types of things this

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.160 
and those types of things this
definitely<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.850> very<00:04:48.180> very<00:04:48.420> small<00:04:48.570> computer

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
definitely is a very very small computer

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.290 
definitely is a very very small computer
and<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:50.040> would<00:04:50.460> definitely<00:04:50.550> recommend<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:51.120> for

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
and I would definitely recommend it for

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.910 
and I would definitely recommend it for
anybody<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> college<00:04:52.440> student<00:04:52.740> or

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
anybody that is a college student or

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.060

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
needing something lightweight on the go

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.770 
needing something lightweight on the go
so<00:04:56.070> now<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:56.910> basically<00:04:57.210> just<00:04:57.420> need<00:04:57.540> to<00:04:57.660> go

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
so now I basically just need to go

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.300
