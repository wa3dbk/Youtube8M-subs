00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
lightweight cleats I honestly I'm not

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.380 
lightweight cleats I honestly I'm not
too<00:02:40.240> big<00:02:40.480> into<00:02:40.780> lightly<00:02:40.990> cleats<00:02:42.270> just<00:02:43.270> like

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
too big into lightly cleats just like

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.420 
too big into lightly cleats just like
the<00:02:43.540> 11<00:02:43.870> froze<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.440> like<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.860> 11<00:02:45.220> froze

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the 11 froze I I like the 11 froze

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.699 
the 11 froze I I like the 11 froze
because<00:02:45.700> they're<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:45.970> super<00:02:46.600> heavy<00:02:47.410> but

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
because they're not super heavy but

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.050

it's totally fine I totally respect that
but<00:03:20.110> in<00:03:20.380> my<00:03:21.040> opinion<00:03:21.190> please<00:03:21.820> don't<00:03:22.120> make<00:03:22.239> you

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
but in my opinion please don't make you

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.710 
but in my opinion please don't make you
run<00:03:22.840> faster<00:03:22.870> or<00:03:23.530> play<00:03:23.830> better<00:03:24.070> but<00:03:24.720> according

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
run faster or play better but according

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.590 
run faster or play better but according
to<00:03:25.900> adidas<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.830> makes<00:03:27.160> your<00:03:27.580> feet<00:03:28.180> stay<00:03:28.540> in

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
to adidas this makes your feet stay in

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.800 
to adidas this makes your feet stay in
place<00:03:28.870> better<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.130> can<00:03:30.970> run<00:03:31.269> faster

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
place better so you can run faster

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.140 
place better so you can run faster
because<00:03:32.050> your<00:03:32.200> foot<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.620> more<00:03:32.860> secure<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.550> I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
because your foot is more secure and I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.850 
because your foot is more secure and I
don't<00:03:34.600> think<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.900> doesn't<00:03:35.260> make<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.470> run

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
don't think it doesn't make you run

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.720 
don't think it doesn't make you run
faster<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.450> kind<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.810> helps<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.620> get<00:03:39.370> or
