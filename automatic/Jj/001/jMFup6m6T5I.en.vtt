00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
speak to the American public like they
weren't<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:47.070> bunch<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.489> morons<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:50.270> really<00:00:51.270> don't

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
weren't a bunch of morons I really don't

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
weren't a bunch of morons I really don't
know<00:00:51.809> why<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.399> us<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.820> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
know why it is that all of us are so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.580 
know why it is that all of us are so
committed<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> sea<00:00:55.309> except<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> am<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.590> think

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
committed to the sea except I am I think

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
committed to the sea except I am I think
it's<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.820> addition<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> fact

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it's because in addition to the fact

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's because in addition to the fact
that<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> sea<00:01:01.250> changes<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.239> light

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that the sea changes and the light

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.050 
that the sea changes and the light
changes<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> ships<00:01:04.650> change<00:01:05.060> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
changes and the ships change it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.380 
changes and the ships change it's
because<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.500> came<00:01:07.710> from<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> sea<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
because we all came from the sea and it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
because we all came from the sea and it
is<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.780> interesting<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.560> biological<00:01:11.340> fact<00:01:11.780> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is an interesting a biological fact that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.609 
is an interesting a biological fact that
all<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> us<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.830> our<00:01:13.979> veins<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:16.229> exact

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
all of us have in our veins the exact

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.670 
all of us have in our veins the exact
same<00:01:16.890> percentage<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.670> Saul<00:01:18.229> in<00:01:19.229> our<00:01:19.380> blood

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
same percentage of Saul in our blood

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.910 
same percentage of Saul in our blood
that<00:01:19.920> exists<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> ocean<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.920> therefore

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that exists in the ocean and therefore

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120 
that exists in the ocean and therefore
we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.909> salt<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> our<00:01:24.630> blood<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.320> our<00:01:25.770> sweat

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
we have salt in our blood in our sweat

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.789 
we have salt in our blood in our sweat
in<00:01:26.520> our<00:01:26.729> tears<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:28.049> tied<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> ocean

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
in our tears we are tied to the ocean

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.630 
in our tears we are tied to the ocean
and<00:01:29.299> when<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> sea<00:01:31.640> whether

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and when we go back to the sea whether

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.600 
and when we go back to the sea whether
it<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> sail<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.140> watch<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:35.460> are

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it is to sail or to watch it we are

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:48.120 
it is to sail or to watch it we are
going<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.060> from<00:01:36.240> whence<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.689> came

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.960 

and<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.659> ends<00:01:50.080> up<00:01:50.170> being<00:01:50.229> an<00:01:50.770> ad<00:01:51.220> for

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970

stick-in-the-mud
who<00:02:14.890> gets<00:02:15.520> creeped<00:02:15.880> out<00:02:16.060> at<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> idea<00:02:16.780> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
who gets creeped out at the idea of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.140 
who gets creeped out at the idea of
someone's<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.810> know<00:02:20.970> someone<00:02:21.970> being

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
someone's you know someone being

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.770 
someone's you know someone being
exploited<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.290> NAT<00:02:23.830> fashion<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.880> it

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
exploited in that NAT fashion and it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.840 
exploited in that NAT fashion and it
turns<00:02:25.989> out<00:02:26.170> no<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.830> was<00:02:27.430> wrong

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
turns out no I was wrong

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.540 
turns out no I was wrong
the<00:02:28.330> reason<00:02:28.690> why<00:02:28.810> people<00:02:29.560> were<00:02:29.860> upset<00:02:30.069> about
