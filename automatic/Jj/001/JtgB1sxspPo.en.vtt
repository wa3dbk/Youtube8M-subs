 friends of youtube here I bring you a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 tutorial is to put tricks in alocÃ©n 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 the truth I do not know if it works in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.910
 multiplayer on other servers 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.280
 xd xd xd xd xd xddddd I think so because 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620
 I used it, we will need two 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 programs are the ensign I already know 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.469
 trainer 3 I will leave them in the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.000
 description of the video xdddd xd xd xd 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.100
 xddddd good first they go to the limit 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.739
 the download then we give a download to 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 I forgot it 's half fire and one 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 Once downloaded, the files will be left 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 where they have saved them here in my case 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.109
 downloads drag them to the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 desktop and already open the two programs 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.920
 and the halo but what the fuck I can not 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 open the halo because I do not have it because 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.220
 my pc is a bitch's daughter and I do not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 runs well xd xd xd xd 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.509
 because this part is very important for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.299
 that you grasp the tricks need to do what 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.159
 next are going to properties I'm going 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.350
 to do with another program so that it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.600
 give an idea go to the shortcut 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 to something right click and properties then 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.409
 up there as a text underlined there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 do not erase anything just write what 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.940
 next will crush the key 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 space or space is then indent 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.950
 console and there are already altogether three forms 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.020
 one is the one that I just told you another is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 same but after console you get 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.970
 space and then and window together another is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.310
 same everything just that after with only 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.619
 they give it space and then together so and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.450
 then together they write good window they give 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.550
 to apply and accept something else to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.860
 activate the tricks to patx the key 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.750
 repat to deactivate it is the same for 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.000
 activate the tricks is with the key that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.679
 is next to the 1 and below they are left 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 pressed to that key and at the same time 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.840
 press the trick key for example 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.149
 f1 for the escrow plus we have the same just 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.100
 that squeeze efe 7 and already to move it 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.229
 tighten the little ball that is in the middle of 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.239
 right and left mouse button and you 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290
 they give the wo with which to advance like this 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.000
 will move the camera 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.769
 to move your hand you just have to 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.540
 move like in the game and to do 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.670
 that speak only point down and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.799
 move the mouse as if they spoke and go 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 that was all friends I hope you serve them 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.909
 the ways to activate the console are 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.250
 girls I'll leave in the video description 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.470
 same as the link and the tricks if you do not 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.150
 then go and sell churros to the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 base of the truck until the next
