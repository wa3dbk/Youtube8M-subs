there<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> sort<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> smaller<00:01:32.100> stiff<00:01:32.729> dome

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
there is sort of a smaller stiff dome

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.080 
there is sort of a smaller stiff dome
this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> used<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.890> create<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.909> on

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this is all I used to create the look on

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
this is all I used to create the look on
my<00:01:36.180> eyes<00:01:36.450> today<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> shadows<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.710> least

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
my eyes today for the shadows at least

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.530 
my eyes today for the shadows at least
obviously<00:01:38.340> there<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> liner<00:01:38.880> involved<00:01:39.420> but

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
obviously there was a liner involved but

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.999 
obviously there was a liner involved but
this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> used<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> very<00:01:40.650> practical

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
this is all I used as a very practical

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
this is all I used as a very practical
brush<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.880> definitely<00:01:42.600> comes<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.869> handy<00:01:42.930> when

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
brush it definitely comes in handy when

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.679 
brush it definitely comes in handy when
actually<00:01:43.649> using<00:01:43.979> these<00:01:44.130> shadows<00:01:44.640> speaking<00:01:45.570> of

right<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.850> did<00:02:19.180> what<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.630> another<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.990> did

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
right now I did what and another I did

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.250 
right now I did what and another I did
dry<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.070> then<00:02:21.520> on<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.820> end<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.450> gold<00:02:22.960> bar

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
dry and then on the end here is gold bar

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.960 
dry and then on the end here is gold bar
and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.590> would<00:02:23.770> say<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.160> obviously<00:02:24.520> more

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and I would say this is obviously more

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.970 
and I would say this is obviously more
of<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.150> green<00:02:25.390> gold<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.960> would<00:02:26.020> honestly<00:02:26.470> call<00:02:26.890> it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
of a green gold I would honestly call it

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.920 
of a green gold I would honestly call it
more<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.250> lime<00:02:27.490> green<00:02:27.520> over<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> gold<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.840> it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
more of a lime green over a gold and it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.740 
more of a lime green over a gold and it
is<00:02:29.170> again<00:02:29.620> shimmery<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:30.940> together<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
is again shimmery as well together it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.210 
is again shimmery as well together it
looks<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.200> creates<00:02:32.500> an<00:02:32.620> overwhelmingly

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
looks like it creates an overwhelmingly

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.190 
looks like it creates an overwhelmingly
warm<00:02:33.610> palette<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.240> have<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.600> say<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:35.020> even

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
warm palette but I have to say that even

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.800 
warm palette but I have to say that even
on<00:02:35.440> my<00:02:35.620> skin<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.220> has<00:02:36.370> pretty<00:02:36.730> heavy<00:02:37.270> neutral

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
on my skin that has pretty heavy neutral

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.660 
on my skin that has pretty heavy neutral
undertones<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.620> still<00:02:38.860> flattered<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.430> really

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
undertones it still flattered it really

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.390 
undertones it still flattered it really
nicely<00:02:39.990> even<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.620> super<00:02:42.100> warm

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
nicely even this really super warm

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
way each of these shadows performed

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.449 
way each of these shadows performed
especially<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.020> mats<00:02:53.470> they're<00:02:54.040> ton<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.340> great

shimmers out there and these are among
them<00:02:56.350> but<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> mats<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.040> particular<00:02:57.340> are<00:02:57.790> very

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
them but the mats in particular are very

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.090 
them but the mats in particular are very
smooth<00:02:58.510> they're<00:02:59.020> not<00:02:59.170> chocking<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.890> least
