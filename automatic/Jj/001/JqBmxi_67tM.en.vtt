00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
that let you know if you have change the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
that let you know if you have change the
secret<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> sequence<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:36.000> key<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
secret in a sequence and the key to the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740 
secret in a sequence and the key to the
healing<00:00:37.980> process<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> taking<00:00:39.239> place<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
healing process that is taking place is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.170 
healing process that is taking place is
probably<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.920> sequence<00:00:41.430> because

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
probably the sequence because

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 
probably the sequence because
frequencies<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.230> pick<00:00:43.469> million

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
frequencies you can pick million

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
frequencies you can pick million
frequencies<00:00:44.730> how<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
frequencies how you how are you going to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
frequencies how you how are you going to
organize<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> way<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.820> will<00:00:48.030> do

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
organize them in a way that it will do

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
organize them in a way that it will do
something<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> positive<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.070> right

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
something for you positive for you right

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
something for you positive for you right
so<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.780> sequence<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
so that that the sequence is so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
so that that the sequence is so
important<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.760> can't<00:00:53.940> change<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
important you can't change that and this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
important you can't change that and this
is<00:00:55.379> why<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.800> need<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.309> Bible<00:00:56.760> music<00:00:57.149> writer

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is why we need the Bible music writer

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.830 
is why we need the Bible music writer
which<00:00:58.050> give<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:59.100> gives<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> notes<00:00:59.969> um
