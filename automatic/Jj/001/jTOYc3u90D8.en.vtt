00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
films outside and stuff like that so you

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.000 
films outside and stuff like that so you

change<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.069> signs<00:04:02.489> around<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.560> windows<00:04:05.359> this

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
change the signs around and windows this

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.780 
change the signs around and windows this
just<00:04:06.569> detects<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.199> active<00:04:07.530> windows<00:04:07.919> names<00:04:08.310> so

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
just detects the active windows names so

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.719 
just detects the active windows names so
it<00:04:08.909> shows<00:04:09.560> what's<00:04:10.560> open<00:04:10.769> at<00:04:11.009> the<00:04:11.099> moment<00:04:11.310> I

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
it shows what's open at the moment I

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:16.039 
it shows what's open at the moment I
think<00:04:12.150> that's<00:04:12.389> so<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.199> can<00:04:13.259> see<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:14.459> know<00:04:15.049> how

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
think that's so you can see you know how

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.189 
think that's so you can see you know how
much<00:04:16.259> CPU<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:18.000> apps<00:04:18.150> use<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.870> stuff<00:04:19.049> like

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
much CPU the apps use it and stuff like

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.850 
much CPU the apps use it and stuff like
that<00:04:19.259> and<00:04:20.780> those<00:04:21.780> go<00:04:21.959> back<00:04:22.139> in<00:04:22.289> sense<00:04:22.560> because

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
that and those go back in sense because

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.770 
that and those go back in sense because

the<00:04:24.930> options<00:04:25.460> well<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.730> think<00:04:27.530> on<00:04:28.530> XDA<00:04:29.070> they

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
the options well I think on XDA they

that some different settings are working

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.930 
that some different settings are working
better<00:04:43.770> than<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.580> said<00:04:44.940> again<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:47.460> stock

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
better than like I said again the stock

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.810 
better than like I said again the stock
setting<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.419> works<00:04:48.720> fine<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.050> me<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:50.639> can

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
setting this works fine for me you can

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.150 
setting this works fine for me you can
choose<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.690> put<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.320> background<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:53.070> the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
choose to put the background on on the

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.010 
choose to put the background on on the
AC<00:04:53.340> power<00:04:53.580> which<00:04:54.210> means<00:04:54.450> obviously<00:04:54.750> when<00:04:54.930> you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
AC power which means obviously when you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
AC power which means obviously when you
plug<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.380> in<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:56.550> can<00:04:56.820> actually<00:04:57.560> make<00:04:58.560> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
plug it in you can actually make the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.640 
plug it in you can actually make the
application<00:04:59.730> work<00:05:00.510> while<00:05:00.960> it's<00:05:01.230> plugged<00:05:01.410> in

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
application work while it's plugged in

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.920 
application work while it's plugged in
which<00:05:02.490> shouldn't<00:05:02.910> usually<00:05:03.300> be<00:05:03.419> necessary

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
which shouldn't usually be necessary

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
which shouldn't usually be necessary
because<00:05:04.110> you're<00:05:04.320> usually<00:05:04.440> going<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.740> be<00:05:04.860> in

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
because you're usually going to be in

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.500 
because you're usually going to be in
your<00:05:05.070> house<00:05:05.220> anyway<00:05:05.700> and<00:05:06.060> it's<00:05:06.210> not<00:05:06.330> going<00:05:06.419> to

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
your house anyway and it's not going to

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.000 
your house anyway and it's not going to
be<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:07.290> know<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.410> summarized<00:05:07.890> own

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
be you know the summarized own

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.210 
be you know the summarized own
reflection<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.669> your<00:05:08.760> screen<00:05:09.950> yeah<00:05:10.950> that's

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
reflection of your screen yeah that's

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.950 
reflection of your screen yeah that's
the<00:05:11.310> main<00:05:11.490> reason<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.850> got<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.120> really<00:05:12.450> because

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
the main reason I got it really because

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.000 
the main reason I got it really because
I<00:05:13.490> found<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.640> when<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:14.910> went<00:05:15.120> outside<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:16.010> hd2

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
I found that when I went outside the hd2

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.340 
I found that when I went outside the hd2
screen<00:05:17.520> really<00:05:18.150> does<00:05:18.479> something<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.020> light

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
screen really does something that light

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.540 
screen really does something that light
and<00:05:20.150> he<00:05:21.150> just<00:05:21.360> can't<00:05:21.570> seem<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.930> see<00:05:22.110> anything

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
and he just can't seem to see anything

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.110 
and he just can't seem to see anything
the<00:05:24.320> settings<00:05:25.320> that<00:05:25.470> came<00:05:25.680> with<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.460> hd2

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
the settings that came with the hd2

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.900 
the settings that came with the hd2
