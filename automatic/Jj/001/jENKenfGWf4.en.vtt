thing<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.360> program<00:01:15.840> has<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
thing that this program has as well is a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.249 
thing that this program has as well is a
really<00:01:17.250> strong<00:01:17.490> anti-bullying<00:01:18.060> theme<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
really strong anti-bullying theme and I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.810 
really strong anti-bullying theme and I
think<00:01:19.439> probably<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:19.950> important

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
think probably the most important

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.749 
think probably the most important
message<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.450> teach<00:01:22.110> children<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
message that we teach children is the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
message that we teach children is the
fact<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> can't<00:01:24.540> catch<00:01:24.930> cancer<00:01:25.590> from

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
fact that you can't catch cancer from

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
fact that you can't catch cancer from
someone<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.180> children<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
someone a lot of children think that you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
someone a lot of children think that you
can<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.619> ask<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.400> before<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> show

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
can we ask that before we do the show

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.179 
can we ask that before we do the show
who<00:01:30.810> thinks<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.350> catch<00:01:31.530> cancer<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> they

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
who thinks you can catch cancer and they

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160
