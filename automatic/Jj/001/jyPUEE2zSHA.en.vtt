potatoes in how many calories did this

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.229 
potatoes in how many calories did this
all<00:04:01.340> come<00:04:01.370> out<00:04:01.640> -<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:04.010> might<00:04:04.580> vary<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.060> little

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
all come out - it might vary a little

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.259 
all come out - it might vary a little
based<00:04:05.900> on<00:04:06.170> whatever<00:04:06.380> but<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.010> exact<00:04:07.580> grams<00:04:08.000> of

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.030 
chronometer I would guess that that's
probably<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.500> typical<00:04:18.830> day<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:20.870> while<00:04:21.739> back<00:04:22.010> I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
probably a typical day a while back I

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.400 
probably a typical day a while back I
used<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.550> always<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.990> know<00:04:24.080> when<00:04:24.229> I<00:04:24.260> was

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
used to always you know when I was

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.510 
used to always you know when I was
pretty<00:04:24.680> dogmatic<00:04:25.220> on<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.460> calories<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:27.520> always

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
pretty dogmatic on the calories I always

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.000 
pretty dogmatic on the calories I always
would<00:04:28.640> try<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.790> eat<00:04:29.000> at<00:04:29.090> least<00:04:29.210> 3,000<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.930> day

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
would try to eat at least 3,000 a day

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.190 
would try to eat at least 3,000 a day
now<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:31.460> eat<00:04:31.669> until<00:04:31.970> I'm<00:04:32.240> satisfied<00:04:32.450> I

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
now I just eat until I'm satisfied I

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.590 
now I just eat until I'm satisfied I
feel<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.650> lot<00:04:34.010> better

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
feel a lot better

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.870 
feel a lot better
my<00:04:36.229> Energy's<00:04:36.770> higher<00:04:37.040> during<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> day<00:04:37.669> I'm

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
my Energy's higher during the day I'm

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.550 
my Energy's higher during the day I'm
not<00:04:37.940> always<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.479> justing<00:04:38.960> big<00:04:39.140> meals<00:04:39.410> I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
not always that justing big meals I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.070 
not always that justing big meals I
don't<00:04:39.740> always<00:04:39.890> feel<00:04:40.100> as<00:04:40.250> bloated<00:04:40.700> so<00:04:40.970> but<00:04:41.870> the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
don't always feel as bloated so but the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050 
don't always feel as bloated so but the
calorie<00:04:42.470> difference<00:04:42.650> isn't<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.550> much<00:04:43.729> it's

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
calorie difference isn't that much it's

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.500 
calorie difference isn't that much it's
like<00:04:44.150> 350<00:04:45.020> 60<00:04:45.470> calories<00:04:45.740> less<00:04:46.220> than<00:04:46.520> 3000<00:04:47.330> so

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
like 350 60 calories less than 3000 so

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.780 
like 350 60 calories less than 3000 so
some<00:04:48.260> days<00:04:48.440> I'm<00:04:48.650> sure<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:48.979> lower<00:04:49.220> some<00:04:49.640> days

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
some days I'm sure it's lower some days

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.490 
some days I'm sure it's lower some days
it's<00:04:50.030> higher<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:52.660> that's<00:04:53.660> all<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:53.960> ate<00:04:54.169> today

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
it's higher so that's all I ate today

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.200 
it's higher so that's all I ate today
that's<00:04:54.770> everything<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:55.340> is<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.550> typical<00:04:56.060> day

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
that's everything this is a typical day

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.650 
that's everything this is a typical day
for<00:04:56.240> me<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:57.620> stretched<00:04:58.460> just<00:04:58.580> eating<00:04:59.060> whole

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660
