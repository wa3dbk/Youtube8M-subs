00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the whole project that we execute in a 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 house has to analyze the family with a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 family lives 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.570
 the aspects of the family defects blue 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.140
 the virtues all you adapt the family 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.140
 in the house there is no house to adapt to the family 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 the project started in 1953 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.320
 although it was made 60 years ago 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.879
 back could say that it was made 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.390
 this year 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.010
 still curious that the condition of being the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.059
 principal of the elderly 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.960
 and then I looked for the alteral projects 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.680
 pupa gives another architectural culture 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.680
 for our population 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.520
 I've always been contrary to 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.790
 architecture our architecture is 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.470
 a colonial culture in the agacha was a fan of 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.460
 cruise 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.560
 You will meet the father of architecture and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.530
 There we went to the wall and he 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.409
 presented in a thousand that did not need 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.060
 to stay inside a box is to do 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.189
 what everyone made him 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.189
 could be 'innovative' could do 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.770
 something different if they observe the house she 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.869
 has the pilotis the rather linear facade 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.899
 with the window in 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.579
 then these are elements that do not 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.579
 were not common at the time 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.350
 curitiba is a difficult city that who 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.200
 single cove always included the cold 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.740
 so you have to adapt case in this 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.740
 year 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.670
 I analyzed the family, all little ones. 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.000
 so you see that the cabinets are from 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.909
 height of them you will find fault 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.150
 It is not a defect that I made of the corpora 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.980
 family make a restoration of you 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.170
 rescues history 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.530
 this is a gift is a gift 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.079
 really has no way to measure 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.379
 the joy of having worked at a 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.650
 satisfactory final result and a 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.120
 pretty work, keep calling 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.239
 attention 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.319
 she remains extremely 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:17.750
 functional you go around the house and think 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.349
 would he live in it with certainty 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.349
 Modern
