all right I got my tailpiece mounted on
here<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.990> course<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.350> not<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.710> place<00:00:04.980> because

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
here of course is not in place because

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.820 
here of course is not in place because
there's<00:00:05.430> no<00:00:05.580> spring<00:00:06.089> pressure<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.899> hold<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.350> in

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
there's no spring pressure to hold it in

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.910 
there's no spring pressure to hold it in
place<00:00:08.480> but<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.630> goes<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.610> that<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> now

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
place but it goes like that and so now

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.730 
place but it goes like that and so now
go<00:00:14.130> ahead<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.309> spring<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.759> baby<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.590> as<00:00:16.590> soon

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
go ahead and spring this baby up as soon

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.590 
go ahead and spring this baby up as soon
as<00:00:16.830> she<00:00:16.890> sounds<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:21.380> well<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> thing<00:00:22.769> is

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
as she sounds like well this thing is

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.810 
as she sounds like well this thing is
certainly<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.840> finished<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.430> together

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
certainly not finished but it's together

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
certainly not finished but it's together
enough<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.810> play<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> can

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
enough so that I can play it and you can

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.279 
enough so that I can play it and you can
get<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.890> idea<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> sounds<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:30.289> this

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
get an idea of what it sounds like this

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
get an idea of what it sounds like this
I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.130> probably<00:00:32.309> said<00:00:32.640> before<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> very

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I think I probably said before is a very

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.410 
I think I probably said before is a very
cheap<00:00:33.510> neck<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.980> nut<00:00:35.420> isn't

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
cheap neck so much so that the nut isn't

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.130 
cheap neck so much so that the nut isn't
placed<00:00:36.899> right<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> strange<00:00:37.890> rattle<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
placed right in the strange rattle I

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.450 
placed right in the strange rattle I
temporarily<00:00:40.140> fixed<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.190> sticking

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
temporarily fixed that just by sticking

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.720 
temporarily fixed that just by sticking
a<00:00:41.790> capo<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.350> pulls<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> strings

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
a capo up here which pulls the strings

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.959 
a capo up here which pulls the strings
down<00:00:44.940> tight<00:00:45.600> against<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.410> fret<00:00:46.920> sort<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
down tight against that fret sort of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.459 
down tight against that fret sort of
lined<00:00:48.210> everything<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.750> pretty<00:00:48.989> well<00:00:49.110> I
