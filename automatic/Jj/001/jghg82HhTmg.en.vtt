00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the very least get a simultaneous launch

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.910 
the very least get a simultaneous launch
so<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.210> odd<00:01:18.619> secondly<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so that's a bit odd secondly the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.570 
so that's a bit odd secondly the
exclusive<00:01:20.640> part<00:01:21.110> now<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> reiterate

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
exclusive part now I want to reiterate

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.420 
exclusive part now I want to reiterate
it's<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.780> exclusive<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> PlayStation<00:01:26.220> 4

it's not exclusive to the PlayStation 4

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's not exclusive to the PlayStation 4
and<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:27.060> also<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> pc<00:01:28.400> but<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and there will also be on the pc but it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480 
and there will also be on the pc but it
obviously<00:01:30.570> does<00:01:31.229> imply<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:32.040> won't<00:01:32.220> be

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
obviously does imply that there won't be

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.630 
obviously does imply that there won't be
an<00:01:32.610> xbox<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.360> version<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> title<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.040> if

perhaps<00:01:52.170> maybe<00:01:52.920> Sony<00:01:53.430> gave<00:01:53.790> Capcom<00:01:54.329> some

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
perhaps maybe Sony gave Capcom some

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.560 
perhaps maybe Sony gave Capcom some
money<00:01:55.490> towards<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> development<00:01:56.700> costs

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
money towards the development costs

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
money towards the development costs
maybe<00:01:57.869> there's<00:01:58.649> something<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.369> in

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
maybe there's something going on in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
maybe there's something going on in
terms<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.850> their<00:02:00.030> technology<00:02:00.750> which<00:02:00.930> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
terms of their technology which is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.649 
terms of their technology which is
pushing<00:02:01.979> them<00:02:02.159> towards<00:02:02.820> releasing<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> only

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
pushing them towards releasing it only

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
pushing them towards releasing it only
on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> ps4<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.469> other<00:02:04.649> words<00:02:04.860> maybe<00:02:05.070> Sony

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on the ps4 in other words maybe Sony

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.730 
on the ps4 in other words maybe Sony
helped<00:02:06.180> Capcom<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.869> produce<00:02:07.170> some<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
helped Capcom so produce some of the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.430 
helped Capcom so produce some of the
game's<00:02:07.950> engine<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.640> whatever<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> reason<00:02:09.780> but

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
game's engine or whatever the reason but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.260 
game's engine or whatever the reason but
right<00:02:10.800> now<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> tray<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.550> does<00:02:11.730> say<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.180> it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
right now the tray that does say that it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.309 
right now the tray that does say that it
is<00:02:12.450> exclusive

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
is exclusive

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.819 
is exclusive
of<00:02:13.379> on<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.400> ps4<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.120> PC<00:02:15.599> from<00:02:16.379> what<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.680> can

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
of on the ps4 and PC from what we can

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.940 
of on the ps4 and PC from what we can
see<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.939> still<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.359> 2d<00:02:18.900> brawler<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.859> other

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
see it is still a 2d brawler so in other

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.949 
see it is still a 2d brawler so in other
words<00:02:20.129> has<00:02:20.249> not<00:02:20.430> gone<00:02:20.579> 3d<00:02:21.090> which<00:02:21.299> I<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.749> one<00:02:21.930> am

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
words has not gone 3d which I for one am

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.309 
words has not gone 3d which I for one am
quite<00:02:22.290> happy<00:02:22.499> about<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.280> similarly<00:02:24.269> most<00:02:25.170> of

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
quite happy about and similarly most of

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.309 
quite happy about and similarly most of
the<00:02:25.379> moves<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.980> appear<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.519> be<00:02:26.670> basically<00:02:27.510> very

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
the moves do appear to be basically very

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.289 
the moves do appear to be basically very
familiar<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:28.980> example<00:02:29.370> Ryu<00:02:29.700> has<00:02:29.909> shinku

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
familiar for example Ryu has shinku

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.479 
familiar for example Ryu has shinku
Hadouken<00:02:30.959> he<00:02:31.079> has<00:02:31.260> tad<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.950> he's<00:02:32.129> fighting

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
Hadouken he has tad so he's fighting

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.240 
Hadouken he has tad so he's fighting
against<00:02:32.760> Chumley<00:02:33.269> in<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.290> screen<00:02:34.799> grabs<00:02:35.069> that

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
against Chumley in the screen grabs that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.240 
against Chumley in the screen grabs that
we've<00:02:35.459> got<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.930> looks<00:02:37.409> quite<00:02:37.709> nice<00:02:37.950> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
we've got and it looks quite nice is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.339 
we've got and it looks quite nice is
definitely<00:02:38.609> a<00:02:38.670> much<00:02:39.090> higher<00:02:39.450> level<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.930> detail

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
definitely a much higher level of detail

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.309 
definitely a much higher level of detail
and<00:02:40.379> compared<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.189> say<00:02:41.340> usf4<00:02:41.879> speaking<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> usf

you<00:02:55.709> know<00:02:55.859> what<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.280> don't<00:02:56.669> think<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.180> going

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
you know what I don't think it's going

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.839 
you know what I don't think it's going
to<00:02:57.389> be<00:02:57.449> released<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.169> said<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.159> don't<00:02:59.489> think<00:02:59.730> it's

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
to be released I said I don't think it's

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.459 
to be released I said I don't think it's
going<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.090> come<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.269> yeah<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.109> it's

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
going to come out yeah I think it's

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.229 
going to come out yeah I think it's
going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.939> something<00:03:02.939> a<00:03:03.090> bit<00:03:03.180> different

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
going to be something a bit different

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.470 
going to be something a bit different
because<00:03:04.169> well<00:03:05.099> Capcom<00:03:05.819> are<00:03:05.939> putting<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.359> much

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
because well Capcom are putting so much

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.089 
because well Capcom are putting so much
into<00:03:06.659> ultra<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.469> obviously<00:03:07.949> that's

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
into ultra and obviously that's

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.849 
into ultra and obviously that's
completely<00:03:08.549> wrong<00:03:09.269> Ultra<00:03:10.230> Street<00:03:10.379> Fighter<00:03:10.469> 4

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
completely wrong Ultra Street Fighter 4

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.050 
completely wrong Ultra Street Fighter 4
of<00:03:11.010> course<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.810> receiving<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.049> Omega<00:03:13.409> mode

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
of course is receiving the Omega mode

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.659 
of course is receiving the Omega mode
but<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.629> would<00:03:15.750> appear<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.049> well<00:03:17.010> Capcom

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
but it would appear that well Capcom

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.339 
but it would appear that well Capcom
want<00:03:17.909> a<00:03:18.060> fighter<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.479> the<00:03:18.509> next<00:03:18.840> generation<00:03:19.259> of

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
want a fighter on the next generation of

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.610 
want a fighter on the next generation of
systems<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.310> would<00:03:21.000> appear<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.930> s<00:03:22.109> f5

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
systems and that would appear to be s f5

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.969 
systems and that would appear to be s f5
and<00:03:23.000> well<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.299> that's<00:03:24.509> the<00:03:24.629> case<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
and well if that's the case then the

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.670 
and well if that's the case then the
previous<00:03:26.430> rumors<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:27.090> us<00:03:27.479> f4<00:03:27.989> for<00:03:28.259> example

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
previous rumors of us f4 for example

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
which would have been fairly cheap to be

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.599 
which would have been fairly cheap to be

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
really wouldn't have been too hard for

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.259 
really wouldn't have been too hard for
capcom<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.859> ported<00:03:41.669> over<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:42.090> both

capcom to have ported over to both
platforms<00:03:43.669> now<00:03:44.669> obviously<00:03:45.199> things<00:03:46.199> are<00:03:46.349> still

platforms now obviously things are still
pretty<00:03:46.590> early<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.239> don't<00:03:48.389> really<00:03:48.509> know

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
pretty early and so we don't really know

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.330 
pretty early and so we don't really know
that<00:03:48.780> much<00:03:48.989> about<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.500> fighting<00:03:49.829> system<00:03:50.009> yet

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
that much about the fighting system yet

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.770 
that much about the fighting system yet
it's<00:03:50.489> still<00:03:50.579> extremely<00:03:50.879> early<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:51.419> don't<00:03:51.629> know

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
it's still extremely early we don't know

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.420 
it's still extremely early we don't know
how<00:03:51.959> many<00:03:52.019> moves<00:03:52.349> have<00:03:52.590> added<00:03:52.859> per<00:03:53.040> character

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
how many moves have added per character

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
how many moves have added per character
we<00:03:53.669> don't<00:03:53.879> know<00:03:54.030> what<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.780> combo<00:03:55.079> system<00:03:55.259> is

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
we don't know what the combo system is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.050 
we don't know what the combo system is
really<00:03:55.769> going<00:03:55.949> to<00:03:56.009> be<00:03:56.219> like<00:03:56.250> we<00:03:56.699> don't<00:03:56.879> really

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
really going to be like we don't really

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.749 
really going to be like we don't really
know<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:58.500> know<00:03:58.530> many<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.310> things<00:03:59.459> like

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759 
know you know many of the things like

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.369 
know you know many of the things like
does<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.060> have<00:04:00.299> focus<00:04:00.659> attack<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.139> type<00:04:01.349> of

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
does it have focus attack that type of

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.140 
does it have focus attack that type of
them<00:04:01.560> we<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.859> see<00:04:02.069> for<00:04:02.219> example<00:04:02.250> Rio<00:04:02.790> kind<00:04:03.060> of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
them we do see for example Rio kind of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.439 
them we do see for example Rio kind of
powering<00:04:03.509> up<00:04:03.719> for<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.019> second<00:04:04.489> which<00:04:05.489> almost

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
powering up for a second which almost

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.839 
powering up for a second which almost
looks<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:07.049> little<00:04:07.409> bit<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.009> tech<00:04:08.370> ins<00:04:08.579> net

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
looks a little bit like tech ins net

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.089 
looks a little bit like tech ins net
suit<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.449> we<00:04:09.659> don't<00:04:09.840> really<00:04:09.959> know<00:04:10.229> all<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.709> the

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
suit but we don't really know all of the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.379 
suit but we don't really know all of the
properties<00:04:11.430> or<00:04:11.669> anything<00:04:11.969> like<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.180> and

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
properties or anything like that and

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.479 
properties or anything like that and
even<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.259> links<00:04:13.530> themselves<00:04:14.099> look<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> little

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
even the links themselves look a little

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.879 
even the links themselves look a little
bit<00:04:14.699> different<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.299> has<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.719> very<00:04:16.469> slight

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
bit different it has a very slight

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.469 
bit different it has a very slight
element<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.519> obviously<00:04:17.849> we're<00:04:18.120> looking<00:04:18.389> at

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
element and obviously we're looking at

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.330 
element and obviously we're looking at
very<00:04:18.690> limited<00:04:19.049> amounts<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.409> footage<00:04:19.739> but<00:04:19.919> it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
very limited amounts of footage but it

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.189 
very limited amounts of footage but it
does<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.669> some<00:04:21.030> elements<00:04:21.599> of<00:04:21.750> street

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
does have some elements of street

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.290 
does have some elements of street
fighter<00:04:22.469> cross<00:04:22.620> tekken<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.639> lot<00:04:24.120> more

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
fighter cross tekken but a lot more

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.330 
fighter cross tekken but a lot more
refined<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.139> definitely<00:04:25.500> does<00:04:25.740> look

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
refined and definitely does look

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.260 
refined and definitely does look
i<00:04:26.400> would<00:04:27.270> say<00:04:27.800> quite<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> step<00:04:29.190> up<00:04:29.250> form<00:04:29.910> street

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
i would say quite a step up form street

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.659 
i would say quite a step up form street
fighter<00:04:30.510> 4<00:04:30.780> but<00:04:31.530> if<00:04:31.620> one<00:04:31.889> was<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.130> carefully

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
fighter 4 but if one was to carefully

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.560 
fighter 4 but if one was to carefully
analyze<00:04:33.080> things<00:04:34.080> such<00:04:34.680> as<00:04:34.919> oh<00:04:35.580> let's<00:04:35.940> just<00:04:36.270> say

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
analyze things such as oh let's just say

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.600 
analyze things such as oh let's just say
the<00:04:36.810> movement<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.440> clothing<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
the movement of the clothing of the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.830 
the movement of the clothing of the
characters<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.090> could<00:04:39.300> definitely<00:04:39.540> see<00:04:39.810> that

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
characters you could definitely see that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.439 
characters you could definitely see that
the<00:04:40.199> movement<00:04:40.889> of<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.250> clothing<00:04:41.550> does<00:04:41.970> much

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
the movement of the clothing does much

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.270 
the movement of the clothing does much
better<00:04:42.479> reflect<00:04:43.199> them<00:04:43.410> what<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.710> ever<00:04:43.889> has<00:04:44.250> in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
better reflect them what it ever has in

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.640 
better reflect them what it ever has in
previous<00:04:44.760> street<00:04:45.210> fighters<00:04:45.600> even<00:04:46.260> when<00:04:46.410> reuse

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
previous street fighters even when reuse

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.110 
previous street fighters even when reuse
doing<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.949> shrink<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:47.250> heard<00:04:47.400> oaken<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:47.970> could

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
doing a shrink you heard oaken you could

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.629 
doing a shrink you heard oaken you could
see<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.870> ambient<00:04:49.380> light<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.130> fireball

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
see the ambient light of the fireball

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.430 
see the ambient light of the fireball
actually<00:04:51.090> reflecting<00:04:51.840> on<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.020> characters

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
actually reflecting on the characters

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.530 
actually reflecting on the characters
clothing<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.580> much<00:04:53.820> better<00:04:54.180> I<00:04:54.389> mean

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
clothing that much better I mean

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.800 
clothing that much better I mean
obviously<00:04:54.660> has<00:04:55.260> been<00:04:55.530> in<00:04:55.710> even<00:04:56.400> usf<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.540> even

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
obviously has been in even usf so even

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.210 
obviously has been in even usf so even
Street<00:04:58.050> Fighter<00:04:58.260> 3<00:04:58.350> did<00:04:58.770> have<00:04:58.919> clothing

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
Street Fighter 3 did have clothing

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.060 
Street Fighter 3 did have clothing
movement<00:04:59.880> if<00:05:00.030> he<00:05:00.360> was<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.540> for<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.810> fireball<00:05:01.320> but

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
movement if he was a for a fireball but

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.219 
movement if he was a for a fireball but
it's<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.090> much<00:05:03.270> sharper<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.960> just

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
it's just that much sharper it just

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.219 
it's just that much sharper it just
looks<00:05:04.440> pretty<00:05:04.770> damn<00:05:04.979> also<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.900> from<00:05:06.900> what<00:05:07.110> I'm

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
looks pretty damn also and from what I'm

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.930 
looks pretty damn also and from what I'm
seeing<00:05:07.260> on<00:05:07.620> some<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.250> attacks<00:05:08.580> for

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
seeing on some of the attacks for

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.150 
seeing on some of the attacks for
example<00:05:09.300> reuse<00:05:09.600> Tetsu<00:05:10.290> there<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.860> ink

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
example reuse Tetsu there is that ink

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
Bloch effect now obviously we don't know

Bloch effect now obviously we don't know
how<00:05:14.160> prolific<00:05:14.580> that's<00:05:14.910> going<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.180> be

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
how prolific that's going to be

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.000 
how prolific that's going to be
throughout<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.630> series<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.200> I'm<00:05:16.830> really
