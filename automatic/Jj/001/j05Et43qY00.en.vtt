00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:13.309
 I know Stefano from a lifetime and he is 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.910
 clearly as for a not as for a 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:21.980
 rookie to play in front of the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:26.900
 then basile the situation 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.580
 he was in some ways sentimental 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.830
 taken then yes because a rule respect 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.960
 to the pilate not because he is here but he knows it 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.379
 very well and so I wanted mine 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.059
 team 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.969
 I wanted my team to play 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.969
 also good to have some sort of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.749
 so attested maybe if it should 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.659
 be there by the pil and it would do me 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:50.749
 huge pleasure because I know that anyway 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.980
 a person if we have a relationship of a 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.069
 certain type 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.399
 beyond this speech here another 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.260
 thing 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.319
 the first thing I have to say about 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.989
 this race here is that if in the last ones 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:06.350
 two weeks the bass had occupied the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.600
 newspaper covers clearly 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.659
 especially Sicilian but also at the level 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.799
 national for playing two games 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.049
 stratospheric barcelona had scored 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.310
 on the classic ignorant shooting at home 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.869
 against verona today we say that we have 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.090
 had perhaps not the same impact 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.060
 statistical but certainly the same 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.210
 impact on the game 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.430
 as for the final minutes from 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.780
 part a person is 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.180
 he had to play or he could play though 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.230
 risking I don't know if it gives you 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.360
 also because then the race was going on 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.120
 putting it up was pretty good 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.650
 until the beginning I didn't want to let him play 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.940
 then it supports portannese files I have 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.100
 turned around I looked at him I asked him from 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.650
 you feel few people but they would 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.180
 answered yes also because after 35 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.170
 minutes sitting on the bench with a 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 Mandate calf would have done by doing 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.850
 well, or rather, he entered the field 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.380
 was decisive was 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.380
 decisive and therefore and therefore it 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.820
 I also thank you for having spent ha 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.350
 past ten bad days because he had 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.930
 this calf problem with fasti 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.890
 very third and last thing I think 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.390
 that my boys beyond the of 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.660
 beyond the performance we played with 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.820
 with a heart with a huge intensity 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.730
 perrino sacrifice I think in this 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.410
 moment both team playing play 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.420
 the best basketball this is not it 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 I say why I 'm here in Turin but why 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.630
 I think 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.769
 and also true that then we were without 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.170
 micevic and with a meta meta rattle 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.700
 services however also true that torino and di 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.850
 this must be proud he played 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.739
 until now winning by winning five 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.720
 therefore, matches without mancinelli and texts 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.030
 so I think that what you have to be 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400
 absolutely happy independently 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.130
 from the fact that today he said why to the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.330
 minimum to allow him to say it too 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.960
 on 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.230
 But my cock is right that he should be 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.630
 said go recognized I would go see 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.400
 juve There is no question, however, if there 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.530
 I 'm answer very willingly 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.600
 don't ask me how much pilla per 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.820
 only since I know I ask but 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:38.130
 no scale has ever given one 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:40.110
 answer if it does not only regulate the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.910
 key to the game 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:49.530
 how lucid you are the difficulties a 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:52.800
 these have been a lot 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:58.500
 good then we have a way of 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.510
 play enough in defense decided me 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.980
 like to change often as well as when 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.930
 I can not change excess of change 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.260
 tactic we came to turin with 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.850
 know of the fact that doing shows with the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.109
 5 changing loaded and much 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.620
 probably we would have given a little effort 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.450
 to mark with you there is 5 amorous challenge from 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.930
 four shoulders to the basket 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.370
 but I am a bit in some ways a bit 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.170
 not slammed because it's not the term 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.150
 correct but nobody worried less 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.340
 because I have a very great spirit of 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.640
 sacrifice by the various months la 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.050
 quintana portannese not to mention 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.420
 clearly then of the bass anyway 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.890
 physically has an extra gear and 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.410
 so when we change with 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.020
 4 and let's go to alarms below 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.570
 basket we manage to be anyway 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.670
 in some ways quite incisive and 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.390
 we suffer a lot especially on rebound 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.130
 and this is the part that mattered but the ii 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.620
 our defense because we have for the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.080
 fortune of an athletic parent like 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.700
 karst men that in short, one 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.610
 hand has it from abundant in defense 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.500
 we knew it was that they would take off playing 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.480
 very well we have clearly searched 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.320
 a little bit of playing on the exterior 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.230
 physically because it was from the point of 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.610
 physical view 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.620
 a place the guards a little more physical and 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.520
 especially because you have a lot of players 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.390
 technical and then not having a play maker 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.470
 of pure role ddddd because it is 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.700
 a player all playing fine 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.790
 glam and carlo is doing so 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.500
 delicious but clearly reasoned for 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.210
 half american we did this 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.220
 done here to put it in 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.470
 internet more than pressure above all 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.410
 on pick and roll on pick and roll 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.000
 we did wrong in the fourth quarter at 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.830
 his fourth quarter when we on the game 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.150
 with on the cage to be able to find 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.720
 good solutions because I was little 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.720
 pressure on the ball 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.880
 other questions guys 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.600
 but you were calling right service 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.060
 I'll be out of Tokyo, the leader that is not there 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.480
 I repeat everything you always want 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.480
 valid reason 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:23.160
 this match satisfaction 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.820
 I don't know what you heard all of 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.000
 registration 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.560
 I make a summary we have players 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.840
 this evening must be demonstrated only 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.690
 enormous from an attachment what 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.310
 we are making huge sharing that 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.900
 suffers the right word for armed churches 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.160
 to empower parents to do 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.360
 feel part of everything 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.040
 It happens 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.480
 we say that there is a great response 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.220
 today like mine today 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.300
 players in this sense ie there 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.980
 they believe they care a lot for me then 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.870
 all the sacrifices you go to ask him a 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.090
 ask them to get a little from 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.260
 this fact I said something here 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.260
 it was annoying that yes
