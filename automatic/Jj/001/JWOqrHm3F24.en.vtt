00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 those rats in a bakery we're 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.970
 talking about a place that is very close 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.280
 of the rivadavia hospital in the northern district and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.170
 that had already denounced the clients 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 we were yesterday and in a little while 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 we could sign those rats that go and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.779
 they come as if nothing in the sight of all 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.369
 but it's not the question in the rat 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.770
 exclusively but all that they generate 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.090
 the conditions of health 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.150
 there really is a careful inspection 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.800
 what can happen if the extremes are not 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.230
 Health conditions in a business 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.500
 as sensitive as a bakery where 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.940
 They manipulate good foodstuffs look at the subject 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.750
 and then we'll tell you what happened 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.750
 yesterday afternoon 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.750
 rats that go from one side to the other 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.850
 an image as unpleasant as 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.150
 amazing for neighbors and customers 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 of this confectionery and bakery located 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.900
 At the corner of Avenida Las Heras and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.900
 tablet in the neighborhood of la recoleta 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.890
 several complaints to the agency 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.430
 government control did 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.390
 possible this inspection in this place 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.230
 mainly by the appearance of rats 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.180
 in the kitchen and between the merchandise but 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.700
 when the inspectors entered 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.730
 They also detected excrement from 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.810
 rodents everywhere a decanter of 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.820
 10 kilos connected when it is illegal 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 contaminated food in the freezers and in 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.250
 the refrigerators and also this local 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.430
 had important failures of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430
 security 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.030
 this confectionery after the operation was 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.000
 closed and now it is expected that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.939
 seize merchandise in poor condition and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.579
 from there wait if you are 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.579
 Irregularities are solved or not 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.140
 good tremendous on the one hand you saw in this 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.110
 note what the neighbors signed in the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.330
 internal part of the bakery where the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.800
 Hygiene conditions really leave 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.010
 Much to be desired, rats came and went 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.930
 all the time but he did not make our 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.850
 mobile that being there for a while a couple of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.070
 hours and the rats were in sight of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.650
 all of you in the local yes yes yes that was 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.780
 the rat that just opened the note 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.880
 opened the report and following the complaint 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.000
 of the neighbors who passed habitually 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.260
 over there at night and they saw the rats 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.120
 say circulating throughout the local 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.460
 they made the complaint and of course that 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.710
 came the people of the city government 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.420
 of Buenos Aires to inspect and not 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.700
 only found rats found 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.020
 a lot of other irregularities and for 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.330
 that closing we go to the images 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.310
 of the procedure that the other 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.590
 from the city of Buenos Aires 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.850
 the inspectors arrived there a little the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.070
 denunciation of the neighbors also the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.930
 presence of telenueve yesterday and placed 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.460
 the closing strips after 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.230
 verify that there was indeed everything 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.950
 type of irregularities in the place 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.740
 It's just a very prestigious bakery 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.370
 daniele we are talking about the neighborhood 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:01.880
 Tagle ball and the big ones if it's 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.110
 an important bakery very recognized 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.550
 there is a lot of movement in the area of â€‹â€‹all 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.870
 ways of this should not happen nor 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.590
 even in a little bakery 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.290
 movement and chiquitita 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.140
 the subject anyone but it is worth clarifying and 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.760
 call attention to be a local 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.310
 commercial so important and so well-known 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.260
 in the neighborhood who does not comply or 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.670
 even with a minimum condition of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.160
 good hygiene let's see what is 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.510
 happening now we're going to ask 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.070
 paula de ambrosio who is working on 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.560
 the place is true that the owners 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.420
 they covered the closing strips we are 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.800
 seeing as the authorities through 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.670
 the inspectors closed the place 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.670
 paula good day 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.280
 a day of angeli gave to the morning when 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.900
 we approach the place two things we 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.810
 they surprised of this recognized 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.320
 Bakery in the Recoleta area first 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.770
 that the food is still displayed as we see 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.020
 the cakes the masses dry the masses 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.410
 fine desserts 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.300
 everything is still displayed in the window in 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.980
 these hillsides that are running 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.290
 because we see that the air works 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.060
 conditioned entered very early 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.849
 the employees and look with that also 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.459
 we are 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.159
 with the closure strip completely 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:14.349
 covered with the same paper with which 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.520
 the products are wrapped in merchandise 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.589
 this paper from the same bakery what 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.869
 they covered from yesterday to night the two 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:25.179
 Completion posters completely 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:28.689
 covered is more to say that this is 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:30.099
 illegal you can not not show the 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:32.919
 poster that the agency places 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:37.240
 governmental control of the city of 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.959
 buenos aires- some of 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.569
 the products certain foods that they had 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:45.699
 in the cupboards that are not refrigerators 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.639
 but the food from the refrigerators like 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.590
 these cakes 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.870
 employees are still in the same place 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.510
 they were admitted very early with several 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.610
 bags 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.130
 the posters of 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.210
 closure and what they did was start 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.600
 to save part 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.360
 of food but for example the bread that 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.700
 is in the lateral zone of this 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.180
 bakery continues in the same place 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.210
 in the sideboards and if we move a little 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.550
 plus 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.979
 we can see that if it is without 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.990
 operating the part of cold cuts and 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.750
 these cages that we are seeing in a 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.569
 Daniel will surprise us because 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.360
 there are new videos that brought us the 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.569
 neighbors of the area merchants also 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.090
 employees who were recording during the 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.979
 January when they passed during the 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.620
 night or when they passed in the morning and the 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:45.910
 bakery was still closed what 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.180
 they say is that during the first days 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.849
 of the year was also closed for 24 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.860
 hours also by the agency 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.599
 government control was 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.460
 closed and the neighbors tell us that 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:01.599
 then those 24 hours that reopened the 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.160
 food was still in the same place in a 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.889
 just nothing more daniel if you think 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.590
 let's know then these new 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.020
 videos and also the testimony of the 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.479
 people who recorded them well really 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.979
 impressive this topic and also calls 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.680
 attention the lack of responsibility 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.300
 of a merchant who does not comply with 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.030
 Minimal hygiene standards but not 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.100
 to enable him in the premises but 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.280
 a matter of common sense 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.290
 social responsibility of not being 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.940
 putting at risk the health of all your 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.670
 customers how can you be working 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.400
 with such a condition of hygiene until 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.630
 for the employees the owners and for 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.550
 those who work in the place is 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.280
 something that plays against them 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.470
 it's really inadmissible not to play with the 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.510
 health and with 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.409
 the health conditions from the 

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.659
 people are really 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:53.360
 very but very damnable good there 

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:55.399
 It is also reprehensible although it is something 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.499
 minor that they have covered the poster for 

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:59.179
 that those who are unprepared do not 

00:07:57.499 --> 00:08:00.830
 they saw the media and also do not know 

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:02.269
 because it is closed today many can 

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.800
 think good are on vacation or 

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:06.199
 close we do not know for some balance 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.439
 then with that intention have they covered the 

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:12.099
 Closing poster really reprehensible 

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:12.099
 also that attitude 

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.100
 but
