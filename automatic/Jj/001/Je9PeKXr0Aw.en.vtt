00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
took the DNA injected herself ate a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.770 
took the DNA injected herself ate a
piece<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> Titan<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.299> she<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.600> these

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
piece of a Titan how did she get these

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
piece of a Titan how did she get these
tightened<00:01:28.020> powers<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.619> she<00:01:28.740> said<00:01:28.950> she<00:01:28.979> stole

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
tightened powers as she said she stole

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.740 
tightened powers as she said she stole
them<00:01:29.610> from<00:01:29.640> them<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.270> point<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> pretty

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
them from them at this point is pretty

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
them from them at this point is pretty
much<00:01:30.960> obvious<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.650> trainer<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.250> bertolt

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
much obvious a trainer and bertolt

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039 
much obvious a trainer and bertolt
didn't<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.329> their<00:01:33.509> own<00:01:33.630> accord

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
didn't do this on their own accord

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.630 
didn't do this on their own accord
there's<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.829> bigger<00:01:35.070> threat<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.610> there

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
there's a much bigger threat out there

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
there's a much bigger threat out there
again<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> has<00:01:36.630> something<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> do

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
again I think it has something to do

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
again I think it has something to do
with<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> eight<00:01:37.619> Titan<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.759> way

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
with the eight Titan because the way

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
with the eight Titan because the way
bertolt<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.420> acting<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.840> chapter<00:01:40.229> when

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
bertolt was acting in this chapter when

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.780 
bertolt was acting in this chapter when
they<00:01:40.439> were<00:01:40.530> basically<00:01:40.770> saying<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.490> everything

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
they were basically saying so everything

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
they were basically saying so everything
he<00:01:41.850> told<00:01:42.000> us<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.329> bullshit<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
he told us was bullshit which at the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
he told us was bullshit which at the
same<00:01:43.500> time<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.890> honest<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.280> felt<00:01:44.460> repetitive

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
same time be honest I felt repetitive

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.700 
same time be honest I felt repetitive
because<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.479> did<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> already<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
because we did get that already for a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.080 
because we did get that already for a
couple<00:01:46.950> different<00:01:47.189> chapters<00:01:47.520> people<00:01:47.939> being

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
couple different chapters people being

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.210 
couple different chapters people being
like<00:01:48.299> especially<00:01:48.750> Eren<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> even<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> Mir

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
like especially Eren and even you Mir

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.550 
like especially Eren and even you Mir
you<00:01:50.579> basically<00:01:51.000> lie<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> us<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.930> said<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
you basically lie to us you said you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170 
you basically lie to us you said you
know<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.710> did<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> were<00:01:53.640> prideful

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
know you did this and you were prideful

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.880 
know you did this and you were prideful
and<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:54.990> bullshit<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.680> felt

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and all of it was bullshit so that felt

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
and all of it was bullshit so that felt
repetitive<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.030> did<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.659> fact<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
repetitive but we did get the fact that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.929 
repetitive but we did get the fact that
you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.530> driving<00:01:59.070> home<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.520> Rainer

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you know it's driving home that Rainer

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.249 
you know it's driving home that Rainer
and<00:02:00.060> Bertold<00:02:00.450> aren't<00:02:00.750> doing<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.079> because

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and Bertold aren't doing this because

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.840 
and Bertold aren't doing this because
they're<00:02:01.560> masochist<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
they're masochist and they just want to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
they're masochist and they just want to
do<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.329> hell<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:04.140> were

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
do this for the hell of it they were

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.050 
do this for the hell of it they were
forced<00:02:04.799> back<00:02:05.040> into<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.490> corner

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
forced back into a corner

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.969 
forced back into a corner
possibly<00:02:06.600> by<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> eighth<00:02:07.110> Titan<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.619> people

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
possibly by the eighth Titan or people

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609 
possibly by the eighth Titan or people
even<00:02:08.220> larger<00:02:09.060> than<00:02:09.090> them<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
even larger than them to do this and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
even larger than them to do this and
there's<00:02:10.979> no<00:02:11.310> pretty<00:02:11.790> much<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:12.629> out<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.020> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
there's no pretty much way out of it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
there's no pretty much way out of it
which<00:02:13.319> is

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
which is

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
which is
really<00:02:13.800> scary<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.460> think<00:02:14.490> about<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.000> at

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
really scary when you think about it at

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.240 
really scary when you think about it at
the<00:02:15.240> armored<00:02:15.660> Titan<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.110> Colossus<00:02:16.680> Titan<00:02:17.070> are

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the armored Titan and Colossus Titan are

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.250 
the armored Titan and Colossus Titan are
scared<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.970> some<00:02:18.180> threat<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.630> there<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
scared of some threat out there and that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.200 
scared of some threat out there and that
also<00:02:19.440> drives<00:02:19.740> home<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> threat<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.730> far

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
also drives home that the threat is far

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.610 
also drives home that the threat is far
greater<00:02:21.240> than<00:02:21.600> what<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:21.990> previously<00:02:22.380> thought

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
greater than what we previously thought

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.440 
greater than what we previously thought
throughout<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> chapter<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.240> drove

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
throughout the chapter just really drove

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.990 
throughout the chapter just really drove
home<00:02:24.510> how<00:02:24.990> scared<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.710> how<00:02:25.860> crazy<00:02:26.250> bertolt<00:02:26.820> is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
home how scared and how crazy bertolt is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.940 
home how scared and how crazy bertolt is
in<00:02:27.210> his<00:02:27.390> head<00:02:27.630> at<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.260> particular<00:02:28.470> point

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
in his head at this particular point

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.080 
in his head at this particular point
because<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.370> everything<00:02:29.700> he's<00:02:29.850> been<00:02:30.030> through

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
because of everything he's been through

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000 
because of everything he's been through
all<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> his<00:02:30.870> troubles<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.500> he<00:02:31.770> probably

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
all of his troubles and he probably

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
all of his troubles and he probably
really<00:02:32.340> wanted<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> dilute<00:02:33.150> himself<00:02:33.630> into

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
really wanted to dilute himself into

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.660 
really wanted to dilute himself into
thinking<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.260> he<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.890> soldier<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.400> like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
thinking that he was a soldier just like

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.400 
thinking that he was a soldier just like
Rainier<00:02:36.090> did<00:02:36.240> at<00:02:36.360> some<00:02:36.510> given<00:02:36.630> point<00:02:36.780> because

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
Rainier did at some given point because

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.470 
Rainier did at some given point because
of<00:02:37.440> whatever<00:02:37.709> threat<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.490> forcing<00:02:39.060> him<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.240> do

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
of whatever threat is forcing him to do

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.760 
of whatever threat is forcing him to do
what<00:02:39.630> he's<00:02:39.780> done<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.290> if<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.410> remember

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
what he's done and if you remember

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.590 
what he's done and if you remember
correctly<00:02:40.920> Rainier<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.820> Bert<00:02:42.000> oatmealy

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
correctly Rainier and Bert oatmealy

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.270 
correctly Rainier and Bert oatmealy
bertolt<00:02:42.990> would<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.410> had<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.709> have<00:02:43.800> been<00:02:43.860> kind

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
bertolt would have had to have been kind

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.890 
bertolt would have had to have been kind
of<00:02:44.400> young<00:02:44.670> when<00:02:45.180> they<00:02:45.330> did<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> very<00:02:45.810> first

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
of young when they did the very first

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.570 
of young when they did the very first
attack<00:02:46.440> knocking<00:02:46.950> down<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> wall<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
attack knocking down the wall and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
attack knocking down the wall and
everything<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.209> at<00:02:48.420> wall<00:02:48.690> Maria<00:02:48.900> we're

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
everything the one at wall Maria we're

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.110 
everything the one at wall Maria we're
pretty<00:02:49.590> much<00:02:49.770> Aaron's<00:02:50.190> mother<00:02:50.400> was<00:02:50.700> killed

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
pretty much Aaron's mother was killed

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880 
pretty much Aaron's mother was killed
they<00:02:51.300> were<00:02:51.360> kind<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.750> young<00:02:51.959> especially<00:02:52.320> Berto

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
they were kind of young especially Berto

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
they were kind of young especially Berto
so<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.550> them<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.700> I've<00:02:53.910> done<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.510> means

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
so for them to I've done that it means

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.290 
so for them to I've done that it means
possibly<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:56.010> they<00:02:56.220> were<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:56.820> back

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
possibly that they were just like back

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.640 
possibly that they were just like back
into<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> corner<00:02:57.989> they<00:02:58.110> don't<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.320> what<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.530> do

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
into a corner they don't know what to do

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.199 
into a corner they don't know what to do
at<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.920> particular<00:02:59.010> point<00:02:59.580> then<00:02:59.910> being

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
at that particular point then being

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.760 
at that particular point then being
older<00:03:00.690> maybe<00:03:00.900> they<00:03:01.080> might<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.350> gone<00:03:01.440> about

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
older maybe they might have gone about

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.680 
older maybe they might have gone about
things<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.400> different<00:03:02.520> way<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.360> different

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
things in a different way in a different

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.449 
things in a different way in a different
manner<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.770> at<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> time<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.370> was

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
manner but for them at the time it was

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.890 
manner but for them at the time it was
probably<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.000> only<00:03:06.239> thing<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.510> could<00:03:06.690> do

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
probably the only thing that could do

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.630 
probably the only thing that could do
your<00:03:07.080> mirror<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.530> her<00:03:07.739> bullshit<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.520> end

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
your mirror with her bullshit at the end

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.340 
your mirror with her bullshit at the end
of<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> day<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.360> who<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:10.110> cares

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
of the day it's like who really cares

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.449 
of the day it's like who really cares
whether<00:03:10.650> you're<00:03:10.830> doing<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.340> yourself

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
whether you're doing it for yourself

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.580 
whether you're doing it for yourself
before<00:03:11.880> historia<00:03:12.600> she<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.350> at<00:03:13.470> this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
before historia she is just at this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.010 
before historia she is just at this
point<00:03:13.709> kind<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.250> being<00:03:14.459> too<00:03:14.850> complex<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.750> even

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
point kind of being too complex to even

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.390 
point kind of being too complex to even
care<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.530> point<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.190> last

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
care at this point is like in the last

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.770 
care at this point is like in the last
couple<00:03:17.610> chapters<00:03:17.880> she<00:03:18.180> keeps<00:03:18.390> giving

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
couple chapters she keeps giving

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.509 
couple chapters she keeps giving
different<00:03:19.110> reasons<00:03:19.739> as<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.950> why<00:03:20.040> she<00:03:20.340> did<00:03:20.489> a

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
different reasons as to why she did a

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.310 
different reasons as to why she did a
lot<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.730> these<00:03:20.910> things<00:03:21.120> woman<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.140> a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
lot of these things woman it is for a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.800 
lot of these things woman it is for a
historic<00:03:23.100> Rishta<00:03:23.790> next<00:03:24.269> minute<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.660> for

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
historic Rishta next minute it's for

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.420 
historic Rishta next minute it's for
herself<00:03:25.140> she<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.620> keeps<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.890> switching<00:03:26.340> it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
herself she just keeps on switching it

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.250 
herself she just keeps on switching it
up<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.790> one<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.180> seemed<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.870> bit<00:03:28.080> more

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
up in this one it seemed a bit more

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.530 
up in this one it seemed a bit more
believable<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.950> way<00:03:29.040> she<00:03:29.250> was<00:03:29.340> acting<00:03:29.610> but<00:03:30.420> at

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
believable the way she was acting but at

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.150 
believable the way she was acting but at
the<00:03:30.630> same<00:03:30.750> time<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.200> like<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.739> know<00:03:31.920> that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
the same time is like you know that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.979 
the same time is like you know that
yamir<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.760> kind<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.299> control<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.780> things

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
yamir is kind of in control of things

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.990 
yamir is kind of in control of things
especially<00:03:34.170> Rader<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.040> bertolt<00:03:35.489> or<00:03:35.610> like<00:03:35.760> yo

especially Rader and bertolt or like yo
at<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.540> particular<00:03:36.690> point<00:03:37.170> she<00:03:37.440> could<00:03:37.620> take

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
at this particular point she could take

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.110 
at this particular point she could take
us<00:03:37.890> out<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.160> she<00:03:38.250> really<00:03:38.280> wanted<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.820> because

she has a small exterior in her Titan

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.190 
she has a small exterior in her Titan
form<00:03:41.610> she<00:03:41.940> could<00:03:42.090> pretty<00:03:42.269> much<00:03:42.360> knock<00:03:42.840> us<00:03:43.049> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
form she could pretty much knock us the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.500 
form she could pretty much knock us the
hell<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.799> she<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.340> tried<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.880> you

hell out if she really tried and you
know<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:45.930> problematic<00:03:46.470> overall<00:03:47.010> but

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
know just be problematic overall but

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.039 
know just be problematic overall but
it's<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:47.730> like<00:03:47.940> what<00:03:48.360> she<00:03:48.510> was<00:03:48.630> telling<00:03:48.780> his

I mean urban has been suspicious from
the<00:05:49.210> get-go<00:05:49.419> anyway<00:05:49.870> when<00:05:50.050> he<00:05:50.139> was<00:05:50.259> saying

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
the get-go anyway when he was saying

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.469 
the get-go anyway when he was saying
little<00:05:50.620> things<00:05:50.860> whispering<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.639> just<00:05:52.270> he's

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
little things whispering and just he's

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:53.879 
little things whispering and just he's
always<00:05:52.659> had<00:05:52.839> this<00:05:52.960> weird<00:05:53.169> vibe<00:05:53.409> and<00:05:53.770> I

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
always had this weird vibe and I

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.139 
always had this weird vibe and I
honestly<00:05:54.310> wouldn't<00:05:54.520> be<00:05:54.639> surprised<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.120> be

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:55.149 
honestly wouldn't be surprised to be

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:56.700 
honestly wouldn't be surprised to be
souls<00:05:55.419> to<00:05:55.599> be<00:05:55.719> a<00:05:55.750> Titan<00:05:56.169> or<00:05:56.229> something<00:05:56.589> maybe

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
souls to be a Titan or something maybe

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.499 
souls to be a Titan or something maybe
that's<00:05:56.919> why<00:05:57.159> he's<00:05:57.520> confident<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.240> bringing

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
that's why he's confident and bringing

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.269 
that's why he's confident and bringing
all<00:05:58.629> these<00:05:58.750> Titans<00:05:59.139> because<00:05:59.469> his<00:05:59.620> ability<00:06:00.189> is

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:00.279 
all these Titans because his ability is

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:01.980 
all these Titans because his ability is
some<00:06:00.460> crazy<00:06:00.759> shit<00:06:00.939> that<00:06:01.300> we<00:06:01.389> don't<00:06:01.539> know<00:06:01.689> or

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
some crazy shit that we don't know or

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.420 
some crazy shit that we don't know or
could<00:06:02.259> be<00:06:02.379> that<00:06:02.529> he<00:06:02.620> just<00:06:02.830> really<00:06:03.129> doesn't

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
could be that he just really doesn't

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.980 
could be that he just really doesn't
give<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.580> fuck<00:06:03.819> and<00:06:04.000> he's<00:06:04.089> gonna<00:06:04.240> sacrifice<00:06:04.539> as

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
give a fuck and he's gonna sacrifice as

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.230 
give a fuck and he's gonna sacrifice as
many<00:06:05.409> people<00:06:05.770> as<00:06:05.860> it<00:06:05.979> takes<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.460> get<00:06:06.759> his<00:06:06.969> goal

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
many people as it takes to get his goal

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.579 
many people as it takes to get his goal
through<00:06:07.539> which<00:06:07.689> in<00:06:07.839> that<00:06:07.930> case<00:06:07.990> he's<00:06:08.379> probably

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
through which in that case he's probably

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.889 
through which in that case he's probably
the<00:06:08.979> most<00:06:09.009> dangerous<00:06:09.430> threat<00:06:10.089> their<00:06:10.389> overall

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:10.899 
the most dangerous threat their overall

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.959 
the most dangerous threat their overall
chapter<00:06:11.259> was<00:06:11.439> a<00:06:11.469> fine<00:06:11.860> chapter<00:06:12.460> Everly<00:06:12.909> a

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
chapter was a fine chapter Everly a

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.429 
chapter was a fine chapter Everly a
little<00:06:13.210> disappointed<00:06:13.779> the<00:06:13.870> pacing<00:06:14.229> just

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 
little disappointed the pacing just

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.320 
little disappointed the pacing just
really<00:06:14.649> wasn't<00:06:14.830> there<00:06:15.129> we<00:06:15.430> have<00:06:15.610> action<00:06:16.120> we

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
really wasn't there we have action we

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.700 
really wasn't there we have action we
have<00:06:16.449> everything<00:06:16.930> but<00:06:17.050> it's<00:06:17.169> just<00:06:17.229> on<00:06:17.439> a<00:06:17.469> more

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
have everything but it's just on a more

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.619 
have everything but it's just on a more
miniscule<00:06:18.339> level<00:06:18.729> and<00:06:19.000> on<00:06:19.120> a<00:06:19.149> more<00:06:19.360> minor

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
miniscule level and on a more minor

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:20.969 
miniscule level and on a more minor
level<00:06:19.870> but<00:06:20.139> we<00:06:20.229> did<00:06:20.409> get<00:06:20.560> a<00:06:20.589> couple<00:06:20.770> of

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
level but we did get a couple of

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.559 
level but we did get a couple of
Revelations<00:06:21.550> and<00:06:21.699> overall<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.089> chapter<00:06:22.449> was

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
Revelations and overall the chapter was

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.600 
Revelations and overall the chapter was
balanced<00:06:23.259> out<00:06:23.379> decently<00:06:23.919> but<00:06:24.129> more<00:06:24.310> so<00:06:24.490> on<00:06:24.580> the

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
balanced out decently but more so on the

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.399 
balanced out decently but more so on the
slower<00:06:24.939> side<00:06:25.210> give<00:06:25.509> a<00:06:25.539> six<00:06:25.810> and<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:25.990> half<00:06:26.020> out<00:06:26.379> of

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
slower side give a six and a half out of

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.050 
slower side give a six and a half out of
ten<00:06:26.500> hopefully<00:06:27.250> we<00:06:27.339> get<00:06:27.430> a<00:06:27.490> little<00:06:27.759> bit<00:06:27.879> more

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
ten hopefully we get a little bit more
