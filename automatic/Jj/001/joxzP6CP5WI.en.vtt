 hello cards mike spiga en i know 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.020
 sure the minecraft pe fans really like this 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.840
 find super cool sitting in monkey 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.010
 namely a lot of items and blocks but 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 there every box in this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 Mike trudged up so you have a lot of items 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.700
 and blocks which have not actually exist say 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.559
 but it is really in the game cell 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.090
 the self- employed deployed a lot 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.800
 no you can not use it yet 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.510
 actually not yet official 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 actually it is not used yet 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.950
 but they are ways in which 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.770
 you can still find and have in your hand 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 so so let 's start with one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.989
 redstone boys come stir just like that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 in the game the will mean that redstone 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.800
 must come so really look redstone 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 they just put it in themselves 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.619
 you can not use it yet say 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 to have already put it in but it 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.640
 is not yet usable but I mean 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.640
 one comes so ruth stone how fat is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 that that is with so many things and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.729
 but in this episode I let it be too 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.409
 very much 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.470
 they are cam 3 chests full of stuff 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.850
 only 30 jazz can be full of things 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 because this is only 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.770
 items are and items cannot post 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 but you still have a lot of blogs 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 not stand and those are also the I go 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.460
 make another video about the blocks 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.110
 and blogs such as platters 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.020
 cobwebs just about those in the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.430
 have children and cobwebs and so that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.990
 for example, you can be flat and they are too 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.750
 but not this one 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.740
 video because they are not items 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.360
 blogs 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.579
 so your block came in late 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.560
 start date this is the redstone 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.590
 very cool what else do we have I know 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.659
 its all the same i have no idea 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.899
 because chickens then we have one here 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.049
 is on spanish um that works 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 of course not yet but it looks bold 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.789
 out to your hand have a saddle and a 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.450
 park in Amsterdam or not 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.360
 rare the saddle already had redstone 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.709

 and the have no cd we have a the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.860
 fishing rod case 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.170
 as you see a real fishing rod one 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.880
 saddle does not know how it has none 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.040
 use but it is used so 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.220
 maybe car the already use i think there 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.989
 not a pan with a loop no we have that 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.690
 not 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:49.329
 Well a pan going to the Kesselt 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.350
 and here we grab all this and one 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.750
 red sweater who had been here a 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.160
 fat thick 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:05.079
 the the the the the the the the the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.269
 the the dips are again many things and 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.090
 it is getting dark unfortunately but at least 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.340
 I'm just going to get everything I've had 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.569
 This looks like this then you can power that 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.200
 does not interest us a fishing rod we have 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.410
 to have 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.540
 we have redstone saddles 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.470
 what is this that we could not see we 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.280

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.709

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.250

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.800
 what you can do on rails is body 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.220

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.490

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.289

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.819
 here you have such 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:15.830
 because I don't know if I say good or cool 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.289

 we've all had 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.309
 death not even during all fat 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.110
 stuff all these stuff must be among 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.550
 the key because they are already in 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.709
 the game is alone is not yet 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.709
 usual and it can't do anything 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:59.240

00:06:54.709 --> 00:07:02.659
 yes that items the stuff that hidden 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.249

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.729
