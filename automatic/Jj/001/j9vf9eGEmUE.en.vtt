00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.490
 hello guys and welcome again 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.410
 after so much time to a stage of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.019
 richard burns reality and as you know 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.690
 after having installed the last 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.840
 version the 2014 mod on the other 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.910
 previous videotutorial today I would like 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.160
 come with a somewhat easy stage to 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 get used to what it is again 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.269
 this extreme driving with this 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.539
 simulator so let's go to a rally 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.210
 fast in the usa this first fleischer 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.610
 wells of 5 kilometers very very fast and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 I cut the truth with a record as you see 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.039
 of 2 13 and a best of three staff 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 minutes walk I 'm not far, well 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.850
 would like to do that yes in good 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.899
 conditions with a very special car 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 that has nothing to do with the 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.539
 modern a ford escort mk2 whose model 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.359
 I love it since I tried it on 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.480
 a factor so nothing else transmission 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.399
 sequential manual in thousand 725 and after 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.329
 we come back with the repetition and some that 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.329
 another feeling 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 31 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.710
 of Earth 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.200
 and well there you have had the stage a 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.280
 final somewhat spectacular very very at 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.320
 limit touching the speed limiter 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.730
 in that fifth march the ford escort the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.400
 it's true that it's been pretty good 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.050
 pretty good after this one 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.910
 intense last curve that almost 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.040
 as after having passed that line 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.020
 of goal so nothing else guys now I 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.290
 I'd like to leave you with the repetition for 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.520
 Enjoy this beautiful landscape 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.200
 these new particles that we have 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.320
 installed with this gravel that 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.880
 surely they are going to look 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.530
 spectacular and nothing else I hope to see you 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.720
 soon in some other stage more 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.240
 while we have started again to give 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.430
 a little bit of cane to this amazing and 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.500
 without a doubt the best simulator of 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.500
 rallies of all history the pc
