00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bumping into this wall just because it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.690 
bumping into this wall just because it's
a<00:00:33.719> little<00:00:33.960> bit<00:00:34.079> harder<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> control<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
a little bit harder to control as you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
a little bit harder to control as you
can<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.630> Mii<00:00:36.870> character<00:00:37.350> me

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
can see I have my Mii character me

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.369 
can see I have my Mii character me
outfit<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.610> believe<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.750> used<00:00:40.170> magic

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
outfit a I believe and I used magic

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590

cruiser<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> shrunk<00:00:41.850> him<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> way<00:00:42.390> down

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
cruiser so I shrunk him all the way down

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.060 
cruiser so I shrunk him all the way down
so<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> could<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> small<00:00:43.500> vehicles<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070

so I could use the small vehicles it
makes<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.640> easier<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:46.079> me<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

actually get a bit confused cuz this is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.209 
actually get a bit confused cuz this is
the<00:00:58.109> first<00:00:58.199> time<00:00:58.559> I've<00:00:58.680> played<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> while

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the first time I've played in a while

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.610 
the first time I've played in a while
but<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.789> managed<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> find<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but we managed to find our way out and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
but we managed to find our way out and
then<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.070> keep<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> pretty

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
then we keep on going this is a pretty

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.810 
then we keep on going this is a pretty
difficult<00:01:04.680> track<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.369> you've<00:01:05.489> never<00:01:05.640> played

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
difficult track of you've never played

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.890 
difficult track of you've never played
it<00:01:06.030> before<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.689> gonna<00:01:06.810> be

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
it before because you're gonna be

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.810 
it before because you're gonna be
sliding<00:01:07.320> around<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.680> ice<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> becomes

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
sliding around the ice but it becomes

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
sliding around the ice but it becomes
pretty<00:01:08.939> easy<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.390> collected<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> shell<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
pretty easy I collected the shell and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.380 
pretty easy I collected the shell and
I'm<00:01:10.920> using<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> shield<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.970> no<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.299> will

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I'm using it as a shield so no one will

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
I'm using it as a shield so no one will
come<00:01:12.600> up<00:01:12.689> from<00:01:12.810> behind<00:01:12.990> me<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.619> shoot<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
come up from behind me and like shoot a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.560 
come up from behind me and like shoot a
red<00:01:14.040> shell<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.400> me<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.700> try<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
red shell at me and try to get me this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
red shell at me and try to get me this
is<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.110> good<00:01:16.259> strategy<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> use<00:01:17.070> because

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
is a really good strategy to use because

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.499 
is a really good strategy to use because
when<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:17.939> place<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.299> right

when you're in first place like right

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
when you're in first place like right
here<00:01:18.810> they'll<00:01:19.320> try<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.619> shoot<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> red

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
here they'll try and shoot you the red

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and it blocked it off but people are

about<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.790> fall<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.150> thought<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:42.600> was<00:04:42.690> over<00:04:42.870> I

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
was like no and once you go off the ramp

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.500 
was like no and once you go off the ramp
though<00:04:50.040> red<00:04:50.250> shells<00:04:50.520> can't<00:04:51.030> follow<00:04:51.270> you

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.330 
though red shells can't follow you
really<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.169> we<00:04:52.260> just<00:04:52.410> continue<00:04:52.830> off<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.130> here

ahead<00:05:51.740> of<00:05:51.830> me<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.400> believe<00:05:52.699> I<00:05:52.790> do<00:05:52.850> get<00:05:53.180> it

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
ahead of me so I believe I do get it

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.629 
ahead of me so I believe I do get it
this<00:05:53.389> time<00:05:53.570> yes<00:05:53.960> I<00:05:54.110> do<00:05:54.229> but<00:05:54.830> he<00:05:55.040> blasts<00:05:55.580> through

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
this time yes I do but he blasts through

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.860 
this time yes I do but he blasts through
in<00:05:55.970> front<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.330> me<00:05:56.389> he<00:05:56.510> must<00:05:56.660> have<00:05:56.720> had<00:05:56.840> a

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
in front of me he must have had a

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.570 
in front of me he must have had a
mushroom<00:05:57.290> or<00:05:57.380> something<00:05:57.410> and<00:05:57.860> he<00:05:58.190> gains<00:05:58.460> the
