00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.530
 when venus is in the sun's margin then according to the theory 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.479
 general relativity 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:14.129
 the radar signal reflected should take a little longer towards us 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.999
 since according to the general theory of relativity the sun curves into space 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.800
 the path of light is therefore longer 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 enter the hollow and exit after 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.619
 you can calculate 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.880
 we want an expected theoretical value of the delay of the return of the signal of the 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.950
 distance in front of the investor 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 it was not true only apparent 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 venus passes behind the sun is overshadowed by saline soils 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.340
 it is clear 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.110
 we continuously send signals to venus and the closer you are 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.200
 of the longest sun is the perfect route 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 and in this program for the first time we are going to put a diagram on the board 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.220
 follow me the blackboard 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 I will describe the delay time 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 let's describe 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.410
 the delay time 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.770
 let's take the tatengue compared to the distance of the hanson 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.550
 and time venus 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.070
 There is a point at which to be inside the sun 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 we will call at this point you star 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.909
 and now I show you the theoretical expected value for this Cuba and it appears like this 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.190
 the delay time is the longest possible the closer you are to the sun 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 they are 240 nanosecond 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.909
 corresponds to 36 kilometers 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 this is the expected theoretical value 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.979
 and now I show you 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.269
 the measured data 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.349
 there is always a small error regarding the theoretical value and that error is 3 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.349
 percent 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:48.099
 that is to say that it is a confirmation with an error of 3% that the data of the theory 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 general of relativity are certain 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.429
 these attitudes regarding the theoretical value is one kilometer 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.959
 we can measure the distance of Venus land with a margin of error of a 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 kilometer 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.029
 and because with that margin of error 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.029
 very easy because venus has mountains 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.479
 the margin of error disappear and thus less was completely plain 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.719
 which is not the case 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.930
 the radar waves depend on the upo orography of venus 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.560
 with the shapiro experiment we have shown that the general theory with 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.559
 rope up to 3% 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.819
 you have to think about this triumph is 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.819
 it's amazing I'm impressed 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.420
 when doing experiments with binary stars when doing it we know 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.419
 attitudes by shapiro experiment 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.550
 I'm impressed 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.589
 mainly by theoretical thinking behind it 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.229
 we started with galileo after the full 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.729
 minute to get there stein 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.259
 this shapiro experiment shows us locally successful 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.590
 and it's the general theory of relativity 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.370
 and I'm not as pessimistic as those who send me regularly full 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 but you know 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.060
 the optimist is the one who believes that we live in the best of all worlds 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.060
 possible 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.039
 and the pessimist
