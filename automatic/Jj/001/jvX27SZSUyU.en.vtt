Naruto a little bit more if you killed
yourself<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:54.750> sadly<00:02:55.620> that's<00:02:56.069> not<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.549> only

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
yourself but sadly that's not the only

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.909 
yourself but sadly that's not the only
reason<00:02:56.849> why<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.810> don't<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.169> Naruto<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:01.769> same

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919

last<00:04:26.280> reason<00:04:27.280> why<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.490> hate<00:04:27.970> Naruto<00:04:28.539> for<00:04:29.229> like<00:04:29.680> a

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
last reason why I hate Naruto for like a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.290 
last reason why I hate Naruto for like a
completely<00:04:30.370> separate<00:04:30.729> video<00:04:31.229> because<00:04:32.229> I

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
completely separate video because I

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.760 
completely separate video because I
tried<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.330> shorten<00:04:35.550> how<00:04:36.550> much<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:38.320> last

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
tried to shorten how much of that last

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.950 
tried to shorten how much of that last
reason<00:04:39.400> but<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:40.240> it's<00:04:40.419> completely

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
reason but like it's completely

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.110 
reason but like it's completely
impossible<00:04:41.310> where<00:04:42.310> I'm<00:04:42.400> turning<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.849> into<00:04:43.000> a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
impossible where I'm turning it into a

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.810 
impossible where I'm turning it into a
twenty<00:04:43.479> minute<00:04:43.630> video<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.289> I'm<00:04:45.099> gonna<00:04:45.250> save<00:04:45.789> it
