be light but I'm okay if we go in a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.540 
be light but I'm okay if we go in a
little<00:03:01.130> bit<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.510> your<00:03:03.080> area<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.470> space<00:03:04.400> is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
little bit you so your area of space is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.550 
little bit you so your area of space is
it<00:03:04.670> more<00:03:04.850> one-on-one<00:03:05.120> or<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.350> type<00:03:06.530> of

guy who thinks of the theories that

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.509 
guy who thinks of the theories that
everybody<00:03:09.019> know<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:09.769> everybody<00:03:10.190> everything

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
everybody know not everybody everything

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.190 
everybody know not everybody everything
is<00:03:10.790> individual<00:03:11.330> okay<00:03:11.630> everybody's<00:03:12.050> different

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
is individual okay everybody's different

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.690 
is individual okay everybody's different
the<00:03:12.830> biochemistry<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.640> mark<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:15.110> your

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
the biochemistry the mark of your

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.490 
the biochemistry the mark of your
heritage<00:03:16.700> only<00:03:17.239> DNA<00:03:17.720> everybody<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.380> different

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
heritage only DNA everybody is different

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.190 
heritage only DNA everybody is different
so<00:03:19.250> when<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.519> start<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.910> work<00:03:20.090> with<00:03:20.299> somebody<00:03:20.750> I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
so when I start to work with somebody I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140 
so when I start to work with somebody I
always<00:03:21.680> check<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> physiological

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
always check not just the physiological

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.080 
always check not just the physiological
parts<00:03:23.450> right<00:03:24.610> see<00:03:25.610> key<00:03:25.760> thing<00:03:25.970> is

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
parts right see key thing is

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.360 
parts right see key thing is
psychological<00:03:26.930> yes<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.739> sometimes<00:03:28.190> more

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
psychological yes that sometimes more
