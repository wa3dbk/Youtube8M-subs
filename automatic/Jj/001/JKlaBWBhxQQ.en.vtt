fine<00:04:00.130> we<00:04:00.340> think<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.550> public<00:04:00.700> favorite<00:04:01.120> is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
fine we think the public favorite is

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.370 
fine we think the public favorite is
going<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.390> define<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.690> we<00:04:01.900> think<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.260> Eagles

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
going to define it we think the Eagles

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.680 
going to define it we think the Eagles
likely<00:04:02.769> wins<00:04:03.010> by<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.580> decent<00:04:03.880> margin<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.540> all

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
likely wins by a decent margin so to all

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.090 
likely wins by a decent margin so to all
the<00:04:04.900> people<00:04:05.200> who<00:04:05.230> are<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.980> know

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
against the Houston defense to he looks

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.390 
against the Houston defense to he looks
serviceable<00:04:37.860> they're<00:04:38.009> not<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.280> do

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400

anything you know above and beyond is

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.170 
anything you know above and beyond is
actually<00:04:40.530> arguably<00:04:40.949> more<00:04:41.130> mobile<00:04:41.580> than<00:04:41.610> Bulls

as<00:04:42.509> well<00:04:42.830> we<00:04:43.830> actually<00:04:43.949> think<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> Eagles

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
as well we actually think the Eagles

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.279 
as well we actually think the Eagles
will<00:04:44.759> do<00:04:44.850> just<00:04:45.090> fine<00:04:45.150> at<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.930> end<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.199> day

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
will do just fine at the end of the day

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.540 
will do just fine at the end of the day
Chip<00:04:46.530> Kelly's<00:04:46.889> one<00:04:47.039> heck<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.400> football

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
coach and as much as Ron Rivera is a

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.400 
coach and as much as Ron Rivera is a
good<00:04:50.220> coach<00:04:50.490> he's<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.449> good<00:04:51.600> defensive<00:04:52.199> coach

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
good coach he's a good defensive coach

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
but on the offensive end they really

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.550 
but on the offensive end they really
struggle<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.270> score<00:04:54.539> points<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:55.110> they<00:04:55.350> face
