00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
New York City and the reason why is

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.090 
New York City and the reason why is
because<00:00:55.330> he's<00:00:55.870> been<00:00:56.050> tracking<00:00:56.380> two-face<00:00:56.920> he's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
because he's been tracking two-face he's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.010 
because he's been tracking two-face he's
been<00:00:57.250> looking<00:00:57.370> for<00:00:57.640> -<00:00:57.760> face<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.180> face<00:00:58.810> had

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
been looking for - face to face had

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.570 
been looking for - face to face had
basically<00:00:59.350> been<00:00:59.440> engaging<00:00:59.890> in<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.220> series<00:01:00.430> of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
basically been engaging in a series of

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.240 
basically been engaging in a series of
heists<00:01:01.120> in<00:01:01.270> Gotham<00:01:01.990> City<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.470> one<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.100> which

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
heists in Gotham City and one of which

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.890 
heists in Gotham City and one of which
was<00:01:03.400> basically<00:01:03.610> him<00:01:04.059> stealing<00:01:04.390> something

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
was basically him stealing something

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.080 
was basically him stealing something
called<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.290> neural<00:01:05.590> net<00:01:05.770> processor<00:01:05.799> now<00:01:06.700> the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
called a neural net processor now the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.849 
called a neural net processor now the
neural<00:01:07.359> net<00:01:07.509> processor<00:01:07.539> is<00:01:08.380> basically<00:01:08.740> a

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
neural net processor is basically a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:10.560 
neural net processor is basically a
device<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.399> will<00:01:09.549> allow<00:01:09.789> or<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.270> guess<00:01:10.450> is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
device that will allow or I guess is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.300 
device that will allow or I guess is
modeled<00:01:10.899> after<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.229> human<00:01:11.499> brain<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.950> it's

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
modeled after the human brain and it's

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.529 
modeled after the human brain and it's
designed<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.759> be<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.909> computer<00:01:13.149> chip<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
designed to be a computer chip the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.149 
designed to be a computer chip the
functions<00:01:13.929> like<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.229> human<00:01:14.590> brain<00:01:14.710> although<00:01:14.979> at

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
functions like a human brain although at

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.950 
functions like a human brain although at
the<00:01:15.280> moment<00:01:15.579> we<00:01:16.030> don't<00:01:16.119> know<00:01:16.210> exactly<00:01:16.630> what<00:01:16.869> it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
the moment we don't know exactly what it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.050 
the moment we don't know exactly what it
is<00:01:17.079> I<00:01:17.289> guess<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:17.979> two-face<00:01:18.399> wants<00:01:18.789> with<00:01:18.939> this

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
is I guess the two-face wants with this

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.910 
is I guess the two-face wants with this
thing<00:01:19.329> so<00:01:19.509> what<00:01:19.659> happens<00:01:20.079> is<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.380> once

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
thing so what happens is that once

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.099 
thing so what happens is that once
Batman<00:01:21.310> actually<00:01:21.460> arrives<00:01:21.909> in<00:01:22.329> in<00:01:22.689> New<00:01:22.899> York

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
Batman actually arrives in in New York

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.510 
Batman actually arrives in in New York
he<00:01:23.319> immediately<00:01:23.469> takes<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.130> sewers<00:01:24.490> to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
he immediately takes to the sewers to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.580 
he immediately takes to the sewers to
basically<00:01:24.999> try<00:01:25.179> to<00:01:25.240> find<00:01:25.539> what<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.289> this<00:01:26.409> going

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
basically try to find what is this going

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.319 
basically try to find what is this going
on<00:01:26.829> where<00:01:27.069> it<00:01:27.159> is<00:01:27.219> two-face<00:01:27.609> is<00:01:27.640> going<00:01:28.119> because

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
on where it is two-face is going because

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.669 
on where it is two-face is going because
he<00:01:28.420> knows<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.689> two-face<00:01:29.049> really<00:01:29.319> isn't<00:01:29.590> gonna

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
he knows a two-face really isn't gonna

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.469 
he knows a two-face really isn't gonna
travel<00:01:29.979> along<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.399> normal<00:01:30.579> streets<00:01:31.030> he's

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
fight is actually a pretty cool scene

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.340 
fight is actually a pretty cool scene
whereby<00:01:58.240> they're<00:01:58.420> both<00:01:58.539> able<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.899> counter<00:01:59.229> the

catches<00:02:03.520> them<00:02:03.670> which<00:02:03.819> i<00:02:03.909> think<00:02:03.969> is<00:02:04.179> probably

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
catches them which i think is probably

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.090 
catches them which i think is probably
one<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.659> coolest<00:02:04.869> moments<00:02:05.469> and<00:02:05.950> this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
one of the coolest moments and this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.379 
one of the coolest moments and this
whole<00:02:06.310> thing<00:02:06.579> where<00:02:06.729> daredevil<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.209> simply

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
whole thing where daredevil just simply

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.999 
whole thing where daredevil just simply
snatches<00:02:07.869> them<00:02:08.020> out<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.350> air<00:02:08.530> before<00:02:08.770> they

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
snatches them out of the air before they

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.339 
snatches them out of the air before they
actually<00:02:09.459> hit<00:02:09.640> him<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.330> addition<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.080> see<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
actually hit him in addition we see the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.390 
actually hit him in addition we see the
two<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.530> them<00:02:11.739> just<00:02:11.860> kind<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.099> going<00:02:12.280> through

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
two of them just kind of going through

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.550 
two of them just kind of going through
hand-to-hand<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:13.299> ultimately<00:02:13.810> they<00:02:14.379> both

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
hand-to-hand but ultimately they both

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.530 
hand-to-hand but ultimately they both
sort<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:14.830> agree<00:02:15.159> here

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
sort of agree here

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.330 
sort of agree here
that<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.959> they're<00:02:16.170> tracking<00:02:16.650> people<00:02:16.980> who<00:02:17.159> may

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that if they're tracking people who may

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.339 
that if they're tracking people who may
very<00:02:17.549> well<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.819> working<00:02:18.150> together<00:02:18.329> then<00:02:19.200> their

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
very well be working together then their

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.110 
very well be working together then their
goal<00:02:19.590> should<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.250> basically<00:02:20.700> track<00:02:21.000> these

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
goal should be to basically track these

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
goal should be to basically track these
individuals<00:02:21.599> down<00:02:21.810> proper<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> go<00:02:22.439> after<00:02:22.620> them

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
individuals down proper to go after them

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.199 
individuals down proper to go after them
to<00:02:23.040> figure<00:02:23.280> out<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.459> their<00:02:23.579> plan<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.849> in<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
to figure out what their plan is in the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.179 
to figure out what their plan is in the
ended<00:02:24.629> as<00:02:25.049> opposed<00:02:25.469> to<00:02:25.620> fighting<00:02:25.829> each<00:02:26.010> other

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
ended as opposed to fighting each other

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.190 
ended as opposed to fighting each other
and<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.909> what<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.569> they<00:02:27.719> effectively

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and so what they do is they effectively

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.740 
and so what they do is they effectively
team<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.799> now<00:02:29.370> what<00:02:29.609> happens<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.180> once<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:30.569> go

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
team up now what happens is once they go

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.360 
team up now what happens is once they go
on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.049> prowl<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.530> they<00:02:31.680> begin<00:02:31.980> looking<00:02:32.159> for

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
on the prowl and they begin looking for

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.369 
on the prowl and they begin looking for
their<00:02:33.000> respective<00:02:33.299> members<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:33.959> twoface<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
their respective members for twoface and

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.160 
their respective members for twoface and
for<00:02:34.799> mr.<00:02:34.950> Hyde<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.879> Batman<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.480> daredevil

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
for mr. Hyde with a Batman and daredevil

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.229 
for mr. Hyde with a Batman and daredevil
proper<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:38.129> come<00:02:38.340> across<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:38.849> appears<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
proper they come across what appears to

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.270 
proper they come across what appears to
be<00:02:39.359> one<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.750> their<00:02:39.870> most<00:02:39.989> recent<00:02:40.140> heists<00:02:40.890> now

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
be one of their most recent heists now

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.830 
be one of their most recent heists now
one<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.609> most<00:02:41.760> recent<00:02:42.060> highs<00:02:42.209> seems<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.720> be

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
one of the most recent highs seems to be

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.229 
one of the most recent highs seems to be
at<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.139> at<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> jewelry<00:02:44.159> store<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.819> this<00:02:45.030> seems

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
at a at a jewelry store and this seems

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.729 
at a at a jewelry store and this seems
sort<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.510> weird<00:02:45.750> because<00:02:46.019> what<00:02:46.260> seems<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.620> be

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
sort of weird because what seems to be

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.129 
sort of weird because what seems to be
happening<00:02:46.859> is<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.849> two-face<00:02:48.389> and<00:02:48.659> mr.<00:02:48.900> Hyde

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
happening is that two-face and mr. Hyde

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.690 
happening is that two-face and mr. Hyde
are<00:02:49.379> just<00:02:49.560> going<00:02:49.829> about<00:02:49.920> committing<00:02:50.340> crimes

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
are just going about committing crimes

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.129 
are just going about committing crimes
or<00:02:50.909> just<00:02:51.030> kind<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.239> going<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.750> criminal

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
or just kind of going on this criminal

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.929 
or just kind of going on this criminal
spree<00:02:52.530> there<00:02:53.010> doesn't<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:53.400> seem<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.849> a

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
spree there doesn't really seem to be a

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.909 
spree there doesn't really seem to be a
rhyme<00:02:54.239> or<00:02:54.269> reason<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.840> why<00:02:55.169> they're<00:02:55.379> doing<00:02:55.739> it

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
rhyme or reason for why they're doing it

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.649 
rhyme or reason for why they're doing it
and<00:02:56.189> so<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.700> happens<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.180> they<00:02:57.299> come<00:02:57.329> across

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
and so what happens is they come across

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.449 
and so what happens is they come across
a<00:02:57.780> woman<00:02:58.200> named<00:02:58.409> Wendy<00:02:58.470> Moreau<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.099> Wendy

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
a woman named Wendy Moreau and Wendy

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.099 
a woman named Wendy Moreau and Wendy
Moreau<00:02:59.669> has<00:02:59.939> basically<00:03:00.329> been<00:03:00.510> killed<00:03:00.840> now<00:03:00.989> as

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
Moreau has basically been killed now as

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.119 
Moreau has basically been killed now as
far<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.409> I<00:03:01.470> understand<00:03:01.859> it

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
far as I understand it

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.649 
far as I understand it
Wendy<00:03:02.579> Moreau<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.939> not<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> character<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.599> has

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
Wendy Moreau is not a character that has

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.990 
Wendy Moreau is not a character that has
any<00:03:03.930> significance<00:03:04.650> although<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.310> might<00:03:05.849> be

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
any significance although I might be

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.099 
any significance although I might be
wrong<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.419> in<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.569> fact<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.780> she<00:03:06.930> might<00:03:07.079> be

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
wrong here in the fact that she might be

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.750 
wrong here in the fact that she might be
a<00:03:07.200> minor<00:03:07.470> character<00:03:07.829> but<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.400> far<00:03:08.579> as<00:03:08.609> I

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
a minor character but as far as I

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.949 
a minor character but as far as I
remember<00:03:09.120> she<00:03:09.569> doesn't<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:09.870> have

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
remember she doesn't really have

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.569 
remember she doesn't really have
anything<00:03:10.260> major<00:03:10.530> due<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.889> Marvel<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:11.250> think<00:03:11.459> she

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
anything major due in Marvel I think she

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.039 
anything major due in Marvel I think she
just<00:03:11.760> may<00:03:11.909> very<00:03:12.090> well<00:03:12.239> be<00:03:12.389> a<00:03:12.419> person<00:03:12.870> who<00:03:12.959> was

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
just may very well be a person who was

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.240 
just may very well be a person who was
just<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.530> wrong<00:03:13.650> place<00:03:13.919> at<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.129> wrong

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
just in the wrong place at the wrong

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.339 
just in the wrong place at the wrong
time<00:03:14.310> when<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.329> heist<00:03:15.629> was<00:03:15.840> committed<00:03:16.260> but

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
time when this heist was committed but

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.170 
time when this heist was committed but
she's<00:03:16.530> been<00:03:16.739> killed<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.730> they<00:03:17.849> take<00:03:18.030> her

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
she's been killed and so they take her

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.909 
she's been killed and so they take her
body<00:03:18.359> down<00:03:18.659> and<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.079> Batman<00:03:19.470> says<00:03:19.739> they're

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
body down and as Batman says they're

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.199 
body down and as Batman says they're
basically<00:03:20.280> going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> give<00:03:20.639> her<00:03:20.729> her<00:03:20.760> dignity

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
basically going to give her her dignity

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.050 
basically going to give her her dignity
back<00:03:21.449> to<00:03:21.690> basically<00:03:21.989> bury<00:03:22.680> her<00:03:22.919> properly<00:03:23.549> but

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
back to basically bury her properly but

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.759 
back to basically bury her properly but
the<00:03:24.120> two<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.449> them<00:03:24.599> continue<00:03:25.049> investigating

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
the two of them continue investigating

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.369 
the two of them continue investigating
here<00:03:26.040> now<00:03:26.190> ultimately<00:03:26.849> what<00:03:27.599> happens<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.199> that

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
here now ultimately what happens is that

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.990 
here now ultimately what happens is that
daredevil<00:03:28.739> begins<00:03:29.129> to<00:03:29.310> piece<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.760> pieces

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
daredevil begins to piece the pieces

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.420 
daredevil begins to piece the pieces
together<00:03:30.299> alongside<00:03:30.870> Batman<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.129> what<00:03:32.310> they

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
together alongside Batman and what they

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.670 
together alongside Batman and what they
realize<00:03:32.849> is<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.359> two<00:03:33.389> phases<00:03:34.049> has<00:03:34.349> stolen

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
realize is that if two phases has stolen

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.890 
realize is that if two phases has stolen
a<00:03:34.919> neural<00:03:35.220> net<00:03:35.370> processor<00:03:35.479> that's<00:03:36.479> designed

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
a neural net processor that's designed

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.300 
a neural net processor that's designed
to<00:03:36.989> tap<00:03:37.229> into<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.560> human<00:03:37.859> brain

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
to tap into the human brain

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.789 
to tap into the human brain

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
Hyde is probably in some capacity

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.750 
Hyde is probably in some capacity
consumed<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.500> neural<00:03:43.799> net<00:03:43.949> processor<00:03:44.159> now<00:03:44.579> I

way the neural net processor is tied in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.759 
way the neural net processor is tied in
to<00:03:50.489> his<00:03:50.669> physiology<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:52.199> whenever<00:03:52.409> it

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
to his physiology and that whenever it

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.619 
to his physiology and that whenever it

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
is that a mr. high commits crimes

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.330 
is that a mr. high commits crimes
whenever<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.229> he<00:03:55.440> begins<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.829> amp<00:03:56.069> up

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
whenever it is that he begins to amp up

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.309 
whenever it is that he begins to amp up
and<00:03:56.609> use<00:03:57.090> his<00:03:57.269> physical<00:03:57.659> strength<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.139> it

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
and use his physical strength that it

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.530 
and use his physical strength that it
pumps<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.889> guess<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.000> juices<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.479> to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
pumps the I guess this the juices so to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.640 
pumps the I guess this the juices so to
speak<00:04:00.780> where<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.019> pumps<00:04:01.260> these<00:04:01.409> pheromones

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
speak where it pumps these pheromones

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.460 
speak where it pumps these pheromones
into<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.849> chip<00:04:03.090> proper<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:04.139> enhances

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
into the the chip proper and it enhances

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.770 
into the the chip proper and it enhances
the<00:04:04.979> chip<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.909> what<00:04:06.150> would<00:04:06.269> happen<00:04:06.479> is

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the chip and so what would happen is

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.089 
the chip and so what would happen is
that<00:04:06.810> two-face<00:04:07.290> would<00:04:07.470> then<00:04:07.590> be<00:04:07.709> able<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.889> take

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
that two-face would then be able to take

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.250 
that two-face would then be able to take
this<00:04:08.250> chip<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.729> sell<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.239> somebody<00:04:09.659> else

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
this chip and sell it to somebody else

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.259 
this chip and sell it to somebody else
for<00:04:10.769> far<00:04:10.979> more<00:04:11.010> than<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:11.459> worth<00:04:11.519> because<00:04:11.939> it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
for far more than it's worth because it

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.330 
for far more than it's worth because it
would<00:04:12.359> be<00:04:12.479> a<00:04:12.509> more<00:04:12.810> enhanced<00:04:13.290> version<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.889> its

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
would be a more enhanced version of its

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.670 
would be a more enhanced version of its
normal<00:04:14.609> neural<00:04:14.909> net<00:04:15.209> processing<00:04:15.840> self<00:04:16.169> but

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
normal neural net processing self but

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.830 
normal neural net processing self but
the<00:04:16.769> problem<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.729> mr.<00:04:18.090> Hyde<00:04:18.299> would<00:04:18.599> not

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
the problem is that mr. Hyde would not

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.899 
the problem is that mr. Hyde would not
survive<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.560> ordeal<00:04:19.739> mr.<00:04:20.280> high<00:04:20.430> would<00:04:20.639> end<00:04:20.820> up

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
survive the ordeal mr. high would end up

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.790 
survive the ordeal mr. high would end up
being<00:04:21.150> killed<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.659> so<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.229> basically<00:04:22.530> seems

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
being killed and so this basically seems

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.440 
being killed and so this basically seems
to<00:04:22.949> be<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.070> ruse<00:04:23.280> by<00:04:23.310> two-face<00:04:23.880> whereby<00:04:24.240> he's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
to be a ruse by two-face whereby he's

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.540 
to be a ruse by two-face whereby he's
using<00:04:24.840> mr.<00:04:25.110> Hyde<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.590> enhance<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.159> chip<00:04:26.370> and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
using mr. Hyde to enhance the chip and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.760 
using mr. Hyde to enhance the chip and
the<00:04:26.909> mr.<00:04:27.150> Hyde<00:04:27.300> will<00:04:27.539> die<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.139> suface<00:04:28.529> can

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
the mr. Hyde will die so that suface can

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.330 
the mr. Hyde will die so that suface can
turn<00:04:28.919> around<00:04:29.010> and

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
turn around and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.370 
turn around and
sell<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.730> chip<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.449> so<00:04:30.600> what<00:04:30.780> happens<00:04:31.199> is

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
sell the chip and so what happens is

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.379 
sell the chip and so what happens is
Batman<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:31.980> daredevil<00:04:32.460> after<00:04:32.760> realizing

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
Batman and daredevil after realizing

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.670 
Batman and daredevil after realizing
this<00:04:33.510> continue<00:04:33.990> their<00:04:34.139> efforts<00:04:34.260> and

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
this continue their efforts and

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.710 
this continue their efforts and
ultimately<00:04:35.130> track<00:04:35.820> down<00:04:36.060> mr.<00:04:36.360> Hyde<00:04:36.690> and

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
ultimately track down mr. Hyde and

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.810 
ultimately track down mr. Hyde and
two-face<00:04:37.470> now<00:04:37.979> when<00:04:38.130> they<00:04:38.220> track<00:04:38.460> them<00:04:38.669> down

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
two-face now when they track them down

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.219 
two-face now when they track them down
they're<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.240> midst<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.660> heist<00:04:39.870> and

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
they're in the midst of a heist and

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.230 
they're in the midst of a heist and
Batman<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.949> first<00:04:41.190> one<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.580> arrive<00:04:41.910> there

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
Batman is the first one to arrive there

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240 
Batman is the first one to arrive there
and<00:04:42.419> of<00:04:42.780> course<00:04:42.810> mr.<00:04:43.320> Hyde<00:04:43.530> not<00:04:43.770> knowing<00:04:44.130> who

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
and of course mr. Hyde not knowing who

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.400 
and of course mr. Hyde not knowing who
Batman<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.639> basically<00:04:45.479> continues<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.169> guess

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
Batman is basically continues so I guess

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.080 
Batman is basically continues so I guess
goes<00:04:46.590> into<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.979> position<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.729> fighting

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
goes into the position of fighting

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.939 
goes into the position of fighting
Batman<00:04:48.449> and<00:04:48.720> two-face<00:04:49.199> continues<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.800> fight

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
Batman and two-face continues to fight

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.490 
Batman and two-face continues to fight
Batman<00:04:50.190> as<00:04:50.580> well<00:04:50.940> now<00:04:51.449> daredevil<00:04:51.990> joins<00:04:52.290> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
Batman as well now daredevil joins the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500 
Batman as well now daredevil joins the
fray<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.800> few<00:04:53.190> minutes<00:04:53.430> after<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.449> you

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
fray a few minutes after and so you

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.270 
fray a few minutes after and so you
basically<00:04:54.900> have<00:04:55.139> this<00:04:55.260> big<00:04:55.470> conflict<00:04:56.130> between

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
basically have this big conflict between

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.610 
basically have this big conflict between
two-face<00:04:56.880> daredevil<00:04:57.479> Batman<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.169> mr.<00:04:58.410> Hyde

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
two-face daredevil Batman and mr. Hyde

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.469 
two-face daredevil Batman and mr. Hyde
all<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.430> which<00:04:59.610> are<00:04:59.790> trying<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.210> figure<00:05:00.449> out

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
all of which are trying to figure out

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.150 
all of which are trying to figure out
what<00:05:00.810> in<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:00.960> world's<00:05:01.229> going<00:05:01.500> on<00:05:01.650> here<00:05:02.010> now

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
what in the world's going on here now

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.300 
what in the world's going on here now
ultimately<00:05:03.200> we<00:05:04.200> find<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.560> daredevil<00:05:04.919> begins

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
ultimately we find that daredevil begins

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.460 
ultimately we find that daredevil begins
to<00:05:05.460> prey<00:05:05.760> on<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.419> nature<00:05:06.600> of<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.990> face<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.410> the

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
to prey on the nature of to face and the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.930 
to prey on the nature of to face and the
since<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.740> two-face<00:05:08.100> needs<00:05:08.370> balance<00:05:08.820> he

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
since the two-face needs balance he

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.430 
since the two-face needs balance he
needs<00:05:09.090> order<00:05:09.419> there<00:05:09.600> has<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.780> be<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:09.990> coin<00:05:10.229> for

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
needs order there has to be a coin for

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.930 
needs order there has to be a coin for
him<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.650> flip<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.130> in<00:05:11.400> order<00:05:11.550> for<00:05:11.700> him<00:05:11.820> to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
him to flip and in order for him to

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.030 
him to flip and in order for him to
decide<00:05:12.180> what<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.540> outcome<00:05:12.900> needs<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.350> be<00:05:13.560> but

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
decide what the outcome needs to be but

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.560 
decide what the outcome needs to be but
the<00:05:14.130> coin<00:05:14.370> seems<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.940> have<00:05:15.030> been<00:05:15.150> taken<00:05:15.330> away

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
the coin seems to have been taken away

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.600 
the coin seems to have been taken away
by<00:05:15.720> daredevil<00:05:16.470> or<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.710> very<00:05:16.860> least<00:05:17.100> it's<00:05:17.370> not

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
by daredevil or the very least it's not

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.280 
by daredevil or the very least it's not
in<00:05:17.820> two<00:05:18.000> phases<00:05:18.210> immediate<00:05:18.780> area<00:05:19.080> where<00:05:19.229> you

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
in two phases immediate area where you

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.110 
in two phases immediate area where you
can<00:05:19.410> grab<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:20.490> what<00:05:20.639> happens<00:05:21.000> as

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
can grab it and so what happens as

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.029 
can grab it and so what happens as
daredevil<00:05:21.330> begins<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.930> prey<00:05:22.139> on<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.380> prey<00:05:22.919> on

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
daredevil begins to prey on a prey on

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.710 
daredevil begins to prey on a prey on
this<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.400> simply<00:05:23.639> saying<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:24.090> two-face

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
this and simply saying that two-face

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.300 
this and simply saying that two-face
himself<00:05:25.200> needs<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.560> make<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> decision<00:05:26.010> that<00:05:26.250> he

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
himself needs to make a decision that he

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.520 
himself needs to make a decision that he
has<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.610> reach<00:05:26.789> back<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.630> Harvey<00:05:28.110> Dent<00:05:28.350> and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
has to reach back to Harvey Dent and

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.770 
has to reach back to Harvey Dent and
what<00:05:28.680> Harvey's<00:05:28.979> instead<00:05:29.430> for<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:30.150> decide<00:05:30.479> what

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
what Harvey's instead for to decide what

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.750 
what Harvey's instead for to decide what
needs<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.080> happen<00:05:31.169> with<00:05:31.740> heaven<00:05:32.310> when<00:05:32.490> mr.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
needs to happen with heaven when mr.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.150 
needs to happen with heaven when mr.
Hyde<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.539> so<00:05:33.750> ultimately<00:05:33.960> what<00:05:34.740> two-face

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
Hyde and so ultimately what two-face

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.190 
Hyde and so ultimately what two-face
seems<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.610> do<00:05:35.789> is<00:05:36.030> he<00:05:36.150> takes<00:05:36.389> a<00:05:36.510> syringe<00:05:36.930> which

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
seems to do is he takes a syringe which

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.710 
seems to do is he takes a syringe which
is<00:05:37.350> designed<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:38.060> neutralize<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.300> neural<00:05:39.570> net

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
is designed to neutralize the neural net

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.050 
is designed to neutralize the neural net
processor<00:05:39.750> chip<00:05:40.530> he<00:05:41.039> calculates<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.729> syringe

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
processor chip he calculates the syringe

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.240 
processor chip he calculates the syringe
accordingly<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.780> then<00:05:42.960> stabs<00:05:43.350> mr.<00:05:43.770> Hyde<00:05:43.979> in

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
accordingly and then stabs mr. Hyde in

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.860 
accordingly and then stabs mr. Hyde in
the<00:05:44.400> neck<00:05:44.550> with<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.880> now<00:05:45.030> we're<00:05:45.630> not<00:05:45.810> really

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
the neck with it now we're not really

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.290 
the neck with it now we're not really
told<00:05:46.470> why<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.400> two-face<00:05:48.120> had

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
told why it is that two-face had

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.879 
told why it is that two-face had
basically<00:05:48.599> backed<00:05:48.900> out<00:05:49.169> of<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.410> deal<00:05:49.560> with

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
basically backed out of the deal with

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.159 
basically backed out of the deal with
with<00:05:50.550> mr.<00:05:50.880> Hyde<00:05:51.090> but<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.690> seems<00:05:51.900> as<00:05:52.050> though

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
with mr. Hyde but it seems as though

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.170 
with mr. Hyde but it seems as though
