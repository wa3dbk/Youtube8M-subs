put a lot of deep deep them onto the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.170 
put a lot of deep deep them onto the
backpack<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.260> big<00:00:58.649> lump<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
backpack which was just one big lump of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
backpack which was just one big lump of
gray<00:01:00.180> plastic<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:01.020> mega<00:01:01.379> bloks<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> do

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
gray plastic is mega bloks like to do

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.850 
gray plastic is mega bloks like to do
with<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> lot<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> their<00:01:02.760> stuff<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.860> then

with a lot of their stuff and then
particularly<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.540> probably

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
particularly I think you can probably

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
particularly I think you can probably
see<00:01:08.299> with<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.570> air<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.260> gun<00:01:10.850> again<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
see with the air the gun again that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.780 
see with the air the gun again that
comes<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.229> gray<00:01:13.710> piece<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.280> plastic

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
comes is just one gray piece of plastic

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.270 
comes is just one gray piece of plastic
and<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.950> I've<00:01:17.070> put

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
wasn't like George's so I've made it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
wasn't like George's so I've made it

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
look as best as I can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.420 
look as best as I can
like<00:01:35.790> George<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.500> another<00:01:38.189> video

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
like George so I will do another video

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.569 
like George so I will do another video
with<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.630> complete<00:01:40.590> noble<00:01:40.979> squad<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.369> some

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
with the complete noble squad at some

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.840 
with the complete noble squad at some
point<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> only<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.560> change<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.040> made<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.579> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
point the only other change I made is is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
point the only other change I made is is
the<00:01:45.119> handle<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.470> back<00:01:46.649> part<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the handle there the back part of the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.060 
the handle there the back part of the
machine<00:01:47.729> gun<00:01:47.939> comes<00:01:48.659> pointing<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> lot

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
machine gun comes pointing down a lot

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.789 
machine gun comes pointing down a lot
more<00:01:50.630> just<00:01:51.630> heating<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> bends<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> up

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
more just heating it up and bends it up

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
more just heating it up and bends it up
it<00:01:53.040> makes<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> lot<00:01:53.640> easier<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.090> George<00:01:54.479> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it makes it a lot easier for George to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.160 
it makes it a lot easier for George to
hold<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.430> actually<00:01:56.430> flat<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> level<00:01:57.659> like

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
hold it actually flat and level like

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
hold it actually flat and level like
George<00:01:58.649> does<00:01:58.979> otherwise<00:01:59.549> he<00:02:00.270> tends<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> be

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
George does otherwise he tends to be

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
George does otherwise he tends to be
pointing<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.469> into<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> sky<00:02:02.070> somewhere

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
pointing it up into the sky somewhere

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.149 
pointing it up into the sky somewhere
which<00:02:02.820> obviously<00:02:03.390> isn't<00:02:03.719> very<00:02:04.049> useful<00:02:04.500> when

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
which obviously isn't very useful when

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.240 
which obviously isn't very useful when
you're<00:02:05.280> taking<00:02:05.759> down<00:02:06.079> covenants<00:02:07.079> come

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
you're taking down covenants come

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.950 
you're taking down covenants come
okay<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.460> let's<00:02:09.880> put<00:02:09.970> George<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.539> one<00:02:10.690> side<00:02:10.929> for

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
okay so let's put George to one side for

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.490 
okay so let's put George to one side for
a<00:02:11.230> second<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.690> latest<00:02:14.020> pack<00:02:14.290> I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
a second and then the latest pack I

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
shoulder covers and on the normal one

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.270 
shoulder covers and on the normal one
they're<00:03:34.750> not<00:03:34.900> differentiated<00:03:35.739> hardly<00:03:36.100> at<00:03:36.190> all

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
they're not differentiated hardly at all

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.940 
they're not differentiated hardly at all
because<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:37.450> back<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.930> arm<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.440> supposed

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
because the back of the arm is supposed

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.250 
because the back of the arm is supposed
to<00:03:39.070> be<00:03:39.220> black<00:03:39.459> hence<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.180> painted<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.079> all
