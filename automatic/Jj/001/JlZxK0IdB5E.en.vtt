00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.680
 hello girls how are today's video 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.580
 it's going to be about conditioners 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.109
 after I put this video showing 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.029
 how fine twins 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.010
 simply with conditioner I have 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.750
 asked several people about whether it is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.660
 sure to leave the conditioner in the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 hair and if I have tension and my hair is left 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.599
 with lumps or with some residue after 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 that after it dries good then 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 in this video we are going to talk a little bit 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 about that the first thing is sure to leave 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 that the conditioner in the hair this 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 depends depends on what kind of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.199
 jesusa conditioner not all 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 conditioners you can leave in the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.699
 hair in the same way there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.100
 ingredients that do not make you 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.699
 damage to your hair when for example 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 you use to clarify at once if you can 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.739
 get to hurt him in the long run if he 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 leave on hair for a long time 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.570
 example an ingredient that I do not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.940
 like to leave in the hair is the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.410
 sodium hydroxide because the hydroxide 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.730
 of sodium is one of the ingredients 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.570
 main of the slides 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.890
 it is possible that leaving the hair with 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.920
 sodium hydroxide for a long time 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.340
 I can get there I do not know how to mistreat 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.730
 break break or even lose the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.060
 gray or not and then for this reason 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.150
 this reason I do not use it or it is not 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.740
 I have not known any specific case 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.180
 that said you know that they to use 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.950
 sodium hydroxide in the hair by 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.040
 a lot of time and that damaged my hair 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.930
 I do not know anything, I just talk to you 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.170
 base of this income based on this 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.420
 ingredient that many this good that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.840
 is present in the slipped 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.640
 simply for that reason that is the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.890
 quantities that are used both in the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.010
 Conditioner like in the curly one are 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.710
 completely opposite but you know that 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.270
 the water for example breaks a stone 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.310
 by force but by perseverance 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.310
 then it is possible that constant use 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.100
 constant and steady hydroxide 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 sodium as living in your hair can 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.830
 to arrive then to arrive can can arrive 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.040
 to be 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.270
 a land of it does not have any lumps and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.520
 neither waste nor balls 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.830
 conditioner in the heras in nothing 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.340
 to be able to say the only thing that happened to me and was 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.590
 this past monday was that me that the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.950
 white hair dried up and let's say what 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.010
 moved so it looked like there are how are you 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.200
 pages that it seems like it 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.000
 form when you use some kind of gel that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.310
 it seems like it has dandruff and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.230
 it's definitely not gas for this is 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.170
 one step but it's the first time in the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 life that happens to me and I've been using 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.840
 the conditioner like oli well from 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.980
 about 4 or 5 years ago 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.310
 that time I used Monday use this 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.620
 conditioner that is 3m but the heat 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.990
 tools this conditioner has less than 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.330
 One month in the market is new, not what 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.940
 had used so it's possible that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.970
 this is the side effect has been 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.709
 for this one for this this dildo in 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.420
 specific because I have already used the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.450
 another three m 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.540
 the one with the blue letters 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.400
 hyde review I do not know what and also has 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.709
 used that is special special 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.980
 for curls and in neither case 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.110
 it has happened to me that the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.810
 hair full of waste or anything 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.720
 also all this past month I have been 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.209
 using the soft one and I do not have any 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.400
 No residue on the hair with the 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.190
 Alberto I see 5 I do not have any left 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.560
 residue with garnier or reuters 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.330
 I do not have any residue left either 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.640
 I think it was basically this 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.170
 specific conditioner and what 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.500
 I did today was to mix it with a 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.970
 little bit of the soft natural apple 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.640
 so much because I really like the aroma of 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.380
 soft natural and to see if this changes 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.650
 a little bit the result right now I do not know about 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.660
 still because the hair is as dry 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.910
 by 90 percent more or less but not 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.190
 it is completely dry and in fact if it 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.380
 move I'm not sorry I do not feel anything like that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.640
 I have to wait for the hair to 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.660
 dry still a little more to see 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 this one yes 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.890
 if I have some secondary texts with 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.180
 this mixture and if not then not to buy 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.310
 more is that type of conditioners 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.080
 so this is basically all of that 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.410
 He gave very short nothing more to explain 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.940
 that ultimately the conditioner is 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.460
 can leave in the hair always and 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.160
 when its ingredients are good for 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.110
 your hair is good to be left and 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.370
 I want to do it in solitude with respect 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.140
 of that the online conditioner 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.020
 many times or most of the time 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.480
 the conditioners and the creams for 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.790
 combed agrolimen have exactly the 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.010
 same ingredients often have 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.720
 a plus one minus maybe this one 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.290
 ingredients also in the position d 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.360
 being the but many but almost 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.440
 they always have the same ingredients 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.030
 then the one sold to you separately from 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.500
 a product that is pretty much what 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.550
 same does not make much sense 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.590
 then if you check that data and set aside 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.620
 of everything if the conditioner data 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.080
 They are good so you can leave them in 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.210
 the hair I definitely tell you with 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.450
 Trust because it 's a water condition 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.280
 that could that could serve you then 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:37.250
 this is all girls very many thanks 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.250
 to see your page see you next
