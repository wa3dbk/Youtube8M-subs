I<00:00:16.350> did<00:00:16.620> this<00:00:16.800> one<00:00:17.090> and<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:19.020> can<00:00:19.110> do<00:00:19.200> it<00:00:19.290> as<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
I did this one and you can do it as a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.930 
I did this one and you can do it as a
shop<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.950> just<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.400> blowing<00:00:20.730> water

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
shop you just have to have blowing water

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.080 
shop you just have to have blowing water
somewhere<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.960> heat<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.200> up<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.620> how<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.970> way

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
somewhere to heat it up at how the way

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.580 
somewhere to heat it up at how the way
the<00:00:24.210> thermostat<00:00:24.690> works<00:00:24.870> is<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.170> spring

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the thermostat works is that spring

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.010 
the thermostat works is that spring
right<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.220> trying<00:00:26.370> to<00:00:26.520> point<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
right there that I'm trying to point to

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.380 
right there that I'm trying to point to
actually<00:00:28.020> when<00:00:28.440> it<00:00:28.470> gets<00:00:28.710> hot<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.670> collapses

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
actually when it gets hot it collapses

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.119 
actually when it gets hot it collapses
and<00:00:30.540> sucks<00:00:30.870> down<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.290> bead<00:00:31.530> there<00:00:31.830> at<00:00:31.950> that

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
and sucks down the bead there at that

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.060 
and sucks down the bead there at that
little<00:00:32.789> bullet<00:00:33.179> at<00:00:33.359> the<00:00:33.449> top<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.019> and<00:00:34.170> opens

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
little bullet at the top of it and opens

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.700 
little bullet at the top of it and opens
the<00:00:35.219> thermostat<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.019> so<00:00:37.019> what<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the thermostat up so what you do is you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
the thermostat up so what you do is you
get<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.859> pot<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.850> water<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.780> put<00:00:39.960> your

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
get a pot of water and you put your

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.810 
get a pot of water and you put your
thermostat<00:00:40.499> there<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.949> pot<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> water<00:00:41.460> on

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
thermostat there on a pot of water on

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.189 
thermostat there on a pot of water on
stove<00:00:41.999> and<00:00:42.749> then<00:00:43.499> we're<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:45.199> slowly

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
stove and then we're going to slowly

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.779 
stove and then we're going to slowly
heat<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.159> temperature<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
heat it up and see what temperature it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.959 
heat it up and see what temperature it
opens<00:00:48.089> out<00:00:48.269> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.659> a<00:00:48.920> 195<00:00:49.920> thermostat<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
opens out this is a 195 thermostat so it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:01.309 
opens out this is a 195 thermostat so it
should<00:00:51.239> open<00:00:51.569> at<00:00:52.339> 200<00:00:53.339> degrees<00:00:54.019> so<00:01:00.170> there<00:01:01.170> we

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
should open at 200 degrees so there we

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.039 
should open at 200 degrees so there we
go<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.889> the<00:01:02.039> stove<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:03.269> got<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.539> mother

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
go we got on the stove we got our mother

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.569 
go we got on the stove we got our mother
in<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> turn<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.369> their

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
in there we're going to turn on their

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.609 
in there we're going to turn on their
heat<00:01:07.430> just<00:01:08.430> took<00:01:08.899> several<00:01:09.899> minutes<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
heat just took several minutes for this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
heat just took several minutes for this
to<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:11.130> temperature<00:01:11.579> so<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> cut<00:01:12.689> part

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to get up to temperature so I cut part

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.539 
to get up to temperature so I cut part
of<00:01:13.079> that<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.430> here<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.790> 160<00:01:16.549> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of that out and here we are at 160 you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
of that out and here we are at 160 you
notice<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.090> water<00:01:18.719> starting<00:01:19.079> to<00:01:19.140> shimmer

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
notice the water starting to shimmer

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
notice the water starting to shimmer
start<00:01:19.829> to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.009> some<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.549> beads<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.060> there

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
start to get some little beads up there

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
start to get some little beads up there
in<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.420> water<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.770> thermostats

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
in the water but the thermostats

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.240 
in the water but the thermostats
thermostats<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.270> open<00:01:24.539> yet<00:01:25.009> that's<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> good

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
thermostats not open yet that's a good

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.469 
thermostats not open yet that's a good
thing<00:01:26.430> since<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> 195<00:01:28.909> we<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.090> sit<00:01:30.329> here

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
thing since it's a 195 we will sit here

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.599 
thing since it's a 195 we will sit here
and<00:01:30.630> wash<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.979> until<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.130> gets<00:01:32.399> up<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
and wash it until it gets up to

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.160 
and wash it until it gets up to
temperature<00:01:33.149> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> brand<00:01:34.109> new

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
temperature this is a brand new

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.050 
temperature this is a brand new
thermostat<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.039> should<00:01:35.280> open<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.060> up

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
thermostat so it should open right up

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
thermostat so it should open right up
here<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.390> we're<00:01:40.049> almost<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.649> temp

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
here we are we're almost up to temp

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.819 
here we are we're almost up to temp
right<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.369> almost<00:01:41.549> 200<00:01:42.030> degrees<00:01:42.829> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
right this is almost 200 degrees and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
right this is almost 200 degrees and
it's<00:01:44.250> almost<00:01:44.549> boiling<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.359> go<00:01:45.539> put<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it's almost boiling here we go put it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.419 
it's almost boiling here we go put it
back<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.039> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
back in there and all you can see the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.660 
back in there and all you can see the
steam<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.079> it<00:01:49.079> opens<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:49.649> quick<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
steam and it opens pretty quick when it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.560 
steam and it opens pretty quick when it
gets<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.909> hot<00:01:51.149> water<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:52.710> spring

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
gets that hot water that that spring

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
gets that hot water that that spring
constricts<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.859> opens<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:55.920> thermostat

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
constricts and opens the thermostat

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.499 
constricts and opens the thermostat
