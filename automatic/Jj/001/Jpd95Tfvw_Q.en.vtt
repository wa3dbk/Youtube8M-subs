00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.359
 hello and welcome to this new mini 4d cinema headset 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.619
 today I'm going to talk to you about the pyroclastic module goal 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 the menu higher than the blind allows you to clear the flames 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029
 explosions 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.529
 smoke that stuff with a particle emitter 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.560
 we find here 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.340
 p replace them afraid his environment so i'm just showing how the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.980
 set up be aware that this module 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.910
 takes a lot of rendering time 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.180
 so your scenes will be very long to report 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.670
 so it is often 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.949
 easier to do all this in post-production with the actual actor 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.980
 that of boys something else 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.120
 but OK 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.610
 it is available in cinema calder 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.089
 it's good to know how to use it 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.470
 so we'll see that right now 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.280
 first, the first thing we need to have in our scene 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.030
 it is a particle emitter 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.160
 that we find here 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.480
 issuers 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 I'm going to turn 90 degrees so that the particles 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.090
 be projected towards rest 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.800
 and not horizontally 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.210
 gold 90 degrees 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.220
 here is a good entrepreneur 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.440
 ras 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.220
 at 90 degrees 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 so there overcome the number of brakes on the stage to pump something 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 I make wounds but we see the particles that 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.290
 no German darty 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.440
 such as made here nothing 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.410
 it's normal it's just private no object suite I 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.230
 could 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.710
 master for example a susi object I have for example a sphere 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 in the immediate future 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.000
 in my emitters such as in my inheritance actually displayed the objects 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.620
 we can see here 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.390
 bare 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 particles are replaced by the cia 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.980
 but it's because we want 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 what we want some people to have a column of smoke 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.140
 what I will need 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.100
 in my scene 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.460
 it's an imperative it's an environment so I'm going into the g 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.969
 here they love each other 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.069
 here environment 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.909
 to add this environment object 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.719
 then this environment object that he needs intras comes out of volume away 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.179
 so I go to my window of materials 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.389
 I go in material files 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.150
 it is reassuring of loss of volume 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.230
 it's rather exciting it goes beyond the screen of the screenshot but 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.179
 that's it 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.919
 volume frasor it looks like that 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.769
 I drag it on my environment 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.540
 if we do not do that we will not see the the subject jan karski so that's when 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.859
 It has to be done 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.919
 then surely the emitter that need the material that will replace so 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.689
 time my window material files matter 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.879
 and I choose 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.869
 pyroclasts hours 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.309
 and g this material that adds 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.479
 to the mischief of the thiÃ©rache place on the transmitter 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.939
 and there I can make a rendering 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.379
 and we see that the material is affected 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.519
 particulate rust particles 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.729
 then this matter we can go modify it 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:15.109
 and then if you can send time presets general 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.359
 ely there are settings already everything for example fire 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.379
 volcano 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.570
 what we want is a cloud of flins 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.720
 a column of smoke so I choose smoke all hope to keep them 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.389
 other 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.939
 smoke and that's it 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.939
 you add info so that you can see something in the background 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.029
 because their black background 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.749
 this not so 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.189
 then we will make a gradient background 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.189
 degraded or 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.369
 circular sheets 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.369
 we will reverse this color 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.069
 we will do something a little deeper 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.069
 perfect his passion the background these jewelers 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.199
 datamine fair la charente says 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.229
 and we only have one column of smoke 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.599
 so the rendering is not great 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.169
 know ok 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.639
 you have to go next in pyroclasts remixed a little bit all the settings for 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.949
 find the right setting 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.349
 this is it exists it is in these models of one can use it 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.109
 and necessarily that cute depending on the particle emitter 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.330
 and it has 7 a particle emitter we can use all these 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.610
 functions for example here I add a breakdown 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.749
 and to have that particles are diverted as a function of this 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.309
 ventilation 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:39.860
 so my cloud 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.189
 of smoke 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.259
 is also diverted 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.120
 Well, that's all for today 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.520
 so I will travel capitulates a transmitter 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.740
 an object 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.690
 pyroclasts rhune a texture more and more buyer an object environment 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.620
 after 102 volume on 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.860
 and then in euro pyroclasts could play that the parameters be the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.199
 presets on other parameters 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.979
 pyroclastic texture
