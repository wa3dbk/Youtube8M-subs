00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 the staff was warmly welcomed until 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.009
 To prevent these and today we give 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.150
 continue the arc blows with the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.340
 salt is a robbery and that he 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.309
 depends a lot on the physics of the home itself 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 to jump type is nothing 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.750
 unlike explaining everything the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.619
 people control the cars there that today is a 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.199
 only the volunteer the site it will do with 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 that the arch our aunt the assault by the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.740
 by their own characteristics 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.700
 marcos santos alone between the back and the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.410
 I'll start the end only you first I'll just 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.309
 I need to talk to you about the point of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 balance 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.739
 there is a point on the arc that it is more 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.020
 of the bead is where it stands 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.920
 for example only with the support 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.910
 of the finger 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.219
 at this point he can stay 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 perfectly stable and this is the so-called 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.039
 g point that you can do this test 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.559
 just look for the point of your bow in 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.560
 that you can keep the arc still 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.710
 it is at this point only with the aid of the soil 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.600
 holding it under what is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.030
 speaking this because the salt it will be 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 made between the mid -balance point 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:26.400
 of the arc or more or less in this 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:28.530
 region here and there for you to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 I like the first site first 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.650
 who only had a very light air are you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.689
 you do not have to do much strength and I want 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.850
 that you hold in an arc only with 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.110
 three of them with the thumb those two 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.659
 fingers in the upper region of the air and you 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.210
 They're going to make a shake-up. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.610
 before that it is important to speak also 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 that the soft and in the frame that will depend 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.890
 much of the flexibility of the fingers 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.370
 so if you can not make a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.140
 and such training aid only 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.180
 your wrist teeth if you have not yet 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.890
 developed this flexibility will not 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.820
 roll it loose and you will not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.460
 to be able to do but is just like Kohler 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.590
 How to explain everything needs a lot to have 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 relaxation flexibility of the fingers 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.350
 here in the composition of the bow then they 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:28.340
 They'll do a workout just advice. 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.440
 of these prices is and there you go up 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:39.200
 the bow to that region that I spoke 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:42.050
 between break-even point and half 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.020
 they realize that the bow drops alone 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.970
 After you got it done there 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.130
 You try to make it direct at this point. 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 look for point that is if you want to mark 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.500
 with cellophane tape for you I 'll get 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.310
 more at the beginning and we return in recess 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:09.170
 only with a direct just put a bow 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:15.980
 try to do is the only movement you 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.959
 put them soon after and they 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.120
 If I did not tell you at the beginning 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.880
 but hopefully it's a big blow 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.350
 difficult to learn and to control 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.380
 You'll have to do enough. 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.450
 exercise but it does not have much secret is just 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.520
 will depend on the flexibility of the fingers 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.060
 you are not something else that is important 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.850
 being is not going to move the arm is just the pulse 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.770
 I'm only going to do this, too. 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.750
 is not only the pulse because if you do only 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:51.160
 one is going to be running is the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:53.560
 close to the mother's wrist 201 hand 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.240
 here is the point of balance between 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.490
 balance between each 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.630
 boat will vary like I said I eat 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.600
 that goal that depends on the characteristics 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.490
 of each one will have a good point the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.040
 Right spot to be done I only had you 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.780
 will have to search to always search and 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.959
 After you've managed to do it alone 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:17.140
 put the street and got lucky is that 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.970
 the site you will see that does not take the mane 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.419
 she kind of does not lose touch with 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.250
 rope will see aa stick swinging and 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.740
 then you have acquired a certain 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.380
 need to place wide 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.390
 I already managed to do just watching you do. 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.380
 scale eight times each note 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.380
 the stock just untold 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.910
 is that thing you can am after 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.730
 already managed to control each 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.500
 eight times can pass with exercise 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.480
 I'll leave the exercise image to 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.400
 You do these eight times. 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.290
 each note 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.610
 then do it four times as if it were 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:08.860
 scaled four times after 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:18.640
 gotta do it four times makes two 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:21.580
 times and it will be used precisely in 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.340
 passages that require a certain lightness and 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.230
 that are very fast then where are you 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.170
 full not apply left more 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.200
 rope is stronger and heavier then 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.570
 bring lightness and speed to your money 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.000
 is very important it is also important 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.450
 as I always speak or ask the 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.090
 underwear is important you to alternate 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.310
 anticipate the chord change then 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.990
 You already go to rope rech already go 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.180
 lowering the elbow to the plane of 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.980
 Strings are always very important you 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.530
 prepare to achieve a 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.080
 but that's it 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.580
 I just hope you like me. 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.530
 I'll leave it as I said I'll stop. 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.210
 be more for you to train and to do 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.670
 always try so first eight months 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.940
 each note later did well against 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.700
 us four months later twice and 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.380
 You can type the promise of 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.650
 to be able to make each note once 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.840
 will have an average speed and to vote is e 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.910
 then you get a certain 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.680
 control both to apply the metronome 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.540
 because like it or not just that it's kind 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.090
 difficult for people like him to be 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.590
 involuntary sometimes we lose a 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.930
 little control of the rhythm of time so 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.700
 also very good hope you have 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.290
 I would like to enroll in 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.370
 channel to receive the rich people who 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.370
 announce until the next
