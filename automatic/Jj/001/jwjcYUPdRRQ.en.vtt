00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it's very small when I compare it to the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
it's very small when I compare it to the
iPhone<00:01:41.820> 5s<00:01:42.329> that's<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.840> we're<00:01:42.990> talking

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
iPhone 5s that's what we're talking

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
iPhone 5s that's what we're talking
about<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.369> got<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> cap<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
about here it's got a cap on it that is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.770 
about here it's got a cap on it that is
removable<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.520> matches<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.390> kind

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
removable and this one matches this kind

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.649 
removable and this one matches this kind
of<00:01:49.009> just<00:01:50.009> matte<00:01:50.340> black<00:01:50.790> look<00:01:51.149> although<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
of just matte black look although it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.410 
of just matte black look although it
also<00:01:51.780> comes<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.979> frosted<00:01:53.850> cover<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
also comes with a frosted cover if you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.959 
also comes with a frosted cover if you
wanted<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.049> basically<00:01:55.619> use<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.189> frosted

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
wanted to basically use that frosted

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.840 
wanted to basically use that frosted
cover<00:01:57.210> instead<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.140> smoky<00:01:58.469> color<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
cover instead kind of a smoky color and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.929 
cover instead kind of a smoky color and
then<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.299> these<00:02:00.509> caps<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.259> an<00:02:01.439> area

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
then on these caps they have an area

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.580 
then on these caps they have an area
right<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> corner<00:02:03.810> where

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
right there on the corner where

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.119 
right there on the corner where
basically<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:06.119> loop<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.380> which<00:02:07.740> also

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
basically you can loop this which also

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.279 
basically you can loop this which also
comes<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.239> particular<00:02:09.509> battery<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
comes with this particular battery so

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.900 
comes with this particular battery so
you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.530> loop<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.580> wanted

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you can loop it on there if you wanted

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.910 
you can loop it on there if you wanted
to<00:02:12.150> make<00:02:12.780> sure<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> don't<00:02:13.470> lose

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to make sure that you don't lose

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.339 
to make sure that you don't lose
that<00:02:14.209> whatever<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.540> now<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.990> battery

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
that whatever it is now the battery

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.870 
that whatever it is now the battery
itself<00:02:16.650> quite<00:02:16.920> simple<00:02:17.400> really<00:02:17.580> there's

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
itself quite simple really there's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.339 
itself quite simple really there's
nothing<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.569> you've<00:02:18.720> got<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.900> lightning

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
nothing to it you've got the lightning

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.050 
nothing to it you've got the lightning
connector<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.980> then<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> battery<00:02:20.459> itself

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
connector and then the battery itself

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
connector and then the battery itself
and<00:02:22.069> right<00:02:23.069> here<00:02:23.310> along<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.790> side<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and right here along the side this is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.510 
and right here along the side this is
your<00:02:25.440> area<00:02:25.650> where<00:02:25.950> you're<00:02:26.069> going<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.220> charge

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
your area where you're going to charge

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.300 
your area where you're going to charge
the<00:02:26.790> battery<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.349> so<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.860> use<00:02:29.130> that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the battery up so you can use that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.910 
the battery up so you can use that
microUSB<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.300> USB<00:02:30.330> plug<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.350> into<00:02:31.500> computer

microUSB to USB plug it into computer

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580 
microUSB to USB plug it into computer
plug<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.910> into<00:02:33.030> let's<00:02:33.420> say<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.630> wall<00:02:34.080> charger

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
plug it into let's say a wall charger

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.930 
plug it into let's say a wall charger
and<00:02:34.709> that's<00:02:35.250> how<00:02:35.340> you're<00:02:35.489> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> charge

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and that's how you're going to charge

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.170 
and that's how you're going to charge
this<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.440> iPhone<00:02:37.590> 5<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.550> 5s<00:02:39.000> or

this up get your iPhone 5 or your 5s or
other<00:02:39.360> device<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.050> lightning<00:02:40.470> plug<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
other device that is lightning plug it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040 
other device that is lightning plug it
in<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.700> already<00:02:41.850> charging<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.569> up<00:02:42.660> for

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
in and it's already charging it up for

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.870 
in and it's already charging it up for
you<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.650> why<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.160> best<00:02:44.459> suited

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
you this is why it's really best suited

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.540 
you this is why it's really best suited
I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.450> an<00:02:45.510> iPhone<00:02:46.050> notice<00:02:47.040> those<00:02:47.250> two

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
I think for an iPhone notice those two

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.009 
I think for an iPhone notice those two
blue<00:02:48.180> lights

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
blue lights

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.170 
blue lights
that's<00:02:49.650> your<00:02:49.860> battery<00:02:50.160> indicator<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.940> means

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that's your battery indicator to means

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.240 
that's your battery indicator to means
that<00:02:51.420> you're<00:02:51.540> between<00:02:51.870> 50<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.350> 100<00:02:52.830> percent

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
that you're between 50 to 100 percent

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.699 
that you're between 50 to 100 percent
charge<00:02:53.519> if<00:02:54.330> only<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.049> those<00:02:55.170> lights<00:02:55.470> is

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
charge if only one of those lights is

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.050 
charge if only one of those lights is
lighting<00:02:56.069> up<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.519> means<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.819> you're

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
lighting up then it means that you're

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.580 
lighting up then it means that you're
between<00:02:57.269> zero<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.310> 49<00:02:59.310> percent<00:02:59.340> charge<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:01.140> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
between zero and 49 percent charge so it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.199 
between zero and 49 percent charge so it
doesn't<00:03:01.950> give<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.220> an<00:03:02.370> extremely<00:03:02.880> accurate

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
doesn't give you an extremely accurate

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.600 
doesn't give you an extremely accurate
reading<00:03:03.930> you're<00:03:04.140> never<00:03:04.319> gonna<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:05.040> my<00:03:05.160> 10

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
reading you're never gonna know on my 10

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.479 
reading you're never gonna know on my 10
percent<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.299> my<00:03:06.390> 40<00:03:07.049> percent<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.340> gives

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
percent and my 40 percent but it gives

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.150 
percent and my 40 percent but it gives
you<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.640> general<00:03:09.030> idea<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.380> course<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.980> can

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
you a general idea and of course you can

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.250 
you a general idea and of course you can
charge<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.730> while<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.510> charging<00:03:12.959> as

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
charge this up while it's charging as

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.550 
charge this up while it's charging as
well<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.130> don't<00:03:14.370> have<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.989> be<00:03:15.989> limited<00:03:16.170> in

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
well so you don't have to be limited in

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.420 
well so you don't have to be limited in
that<00:03:16.739> regard<00:03:17.359> it<00:03:18.359> charges<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.109> fine<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
that regard it charges just fine and the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.280 
that regard it charges just fine and the
nice<00:03:20.579> thing<00:03:20.609> about<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.329> execution<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.109> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
nice thing about the execution of this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
nice thing about the execution of this
is<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:23.100> still<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> pretty<00:03:24.120> lightweight

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
is that it still is pretty lightweight

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.930 
is that it still is pretty lightweight
yeah<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.200> gonna<00:03:25.350> add<00:03:25.620> definitely<00:03:26.370> length<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
yeah it's gonna add definitely length to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.599 
yeah it's gonna add definitely length to
your<00:03:26.970> iPhone<00:03:27.510> 5<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.290> lot<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.560> cases<00:03:29.160> are

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
your iPhone 5 and a lot of cases are

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.300 
your iPhone 5 and a lot of cases are
probably<00:03:30.030> not<00:03:30.180> going<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.390> work<00:03:30.570> with<00:03:30.840> this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
probably not going to work with this

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.039 
probably not going to work with this
unless<00:03:32.310> they<00:03:32.700> are<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> snap-on<00:03:33.480> back<00:03:33.750> shell

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
unless they are a snap-on back shell

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.319 
unless they are a snap-on back shell
that's<00:03:34.230> fairly<00:03:34.680> thin<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.489> because<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
that's fairly thin just because of the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.810 
that's fairly thin just because of the
way<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.810> sits<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.380> place<00:03:37.820> but

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
way that this sits in place but

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.340 
way that this sits in place but
certainly<00:03:39.180> if<00:03:39.329> you're<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.660> phone<00:03:39.870> call<00:03:39.930> and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
certainly if you're on a phone call and

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.930 
certainly if you're on a phone call and
you<00:03:40.410> can't<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.769> hands-free<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.760> up<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
you can't go hands-free this is up to

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.479 
you can't go hands-free this is up to
your<00:03:42.180> ear<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:42.600> whatever<00:03:42.780> reason<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:44.280> can

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
your ear for whatever reason you can

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.509 
your ear for whatever reason you can
still<00:03:44.850> basically<00:03:45.810> use<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.680> for<00:03:47.280> phone<00:03:47.489> calls

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
still basically use it for phone calls

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.849 
still basically use it for phone calls
things<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.510> or<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.709> don't

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
things like that or if you just don't

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.280 
things like that or if you just don't
want<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> carry<00:03:50.519> around<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:51.000> large<00:03:51.239> battery<00:03:51.810> you
