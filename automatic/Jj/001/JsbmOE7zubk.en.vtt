00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.849 
fullscreen your game go to town and yeah
so<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:56.280> pretty<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.740> there<00:01:58.740> will

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
so that's pretty much it and there will

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.440 
so that's pretty much it and there will
be<00:01:58.890> better<00:01:59.130> solutions<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.209> permanent

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
be better solutions or more permanent

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
be better solutions or more permanent
solutions<00:02:01.170> rather<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.709> will<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.250> come

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
solutions rather that will probably come

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.599 
solutions rather that will probably come
out<00:02:02.459> to<00:02:02.819> actually<00:02:03.000> modify<00:02:04.009> how<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.219> value

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
out to actually modify how this value

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.749 
out to actually modify how this value
works<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.209> things<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.569> that<00:02:07.190> or<00:02:08.190> maybe<00:02:08.579> not

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
works and things like that or maybe not

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.059 
works and things like that or maybe not
