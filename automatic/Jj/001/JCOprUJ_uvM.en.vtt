00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.220
 hello today video 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.900
 really very helpful she 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.860
 Required to view all who want 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.679
 lose weight 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 let's see why because in 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.859
 I will tell you about how to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 distribute proteins and fats and carbohydrates 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.439
 during the day why is this important yes because 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 what if you little go them you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.340
 really small calorie 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.410
 diet but proteins fats carbohydrates come 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 wrong and time then you risk not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 only lose weight and then type all these 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.460
 pounds back but even dial 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.920
 more than it was, let's figure it out 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.989
 first place we give the squirrel 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.850
 he has a building function there 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 protein is not very important already 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.950
 repeated and it already said in others 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 their videos but it is a lack of protein 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 very often leads to the fact that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 weight loss stops 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.210
 I think most people often 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.910
 pushing such a problem waiting 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.359
 you train you practice very very 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.699
 eat well it seems to them but in the end 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.650
 weight stops and at this moment us 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.470
 really very easy because 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.030
 the mood drops terribly if in this you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.799
 know yourself then you definitely need 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.740
 review your diet 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.799
 you must remember that squirrels are what 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.729
 you can eat your every meal 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.509
 but most importantly in moderation 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.030
 Of course it is very important proteins this is why 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.090
 you must begin the chiefs and end 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 its for example in the morning with complex 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 carbohydrates in the form of porridge you must eat 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.840
 there is egg white 1 or 2 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.670
 at least and just as well the last one that you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 eat on ours just as it should be 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 something protein and generally will not 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.200
 go into details do so 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.360
 necessarily carbohydrates and moreover 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 This most often cereals which here on 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 garnish for example buckwheat rice and fruit 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.860
 Of course, all these carbohydrates should 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.700
 do your body until hours then 4 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.640
 up to 5 days why everything is very simple 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.979
 energy in the evening but more often we 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.100
 amen and active than the whole day 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.290
 tired from school Iâ€™m not working 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.149
 I do not know every person at night 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340
 given a very active evening 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.590
 accordingly if you have not spent 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.350
 energy from these carbohydrates then she 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.230
 will be on your sides got their stomachs 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.000
 well, or where anyone has trouble spots 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.620
 so remember this rule and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.860
 be sure to stick with it 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.510
 and a little bit of fat is fat and this energy is like 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.880
 and carbohydrates so they should 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 arrive in the morning it's to 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.290
 An example may be a few snacks. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.590
 what are there nuts well period 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.470
 between for example breakfast and lunch 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.810
 let's again I sum up to this 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.630
 not very long but really 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.140
 useful video but about squirrels fats 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.260
 carbohydrates how to shoot them the rank of the day 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.050
 am 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.370
 these can be proteins fats and carbohydrates then 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.160
 there it may very well be 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.019
 porridge egg but you can add to porridge 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.870
 nuts here you have a full set 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.019
 and very good useful 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.299
 lunch it can also be squirrels fats 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.269
 carbohydrates well I most often fat 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.150
 I refuse for lunch for example I do not know 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.519
 some fish there with rice 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.400
 here for me this is a super lunch for sure 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.540
 same vegetables is fiber they can 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 consumed in large quantities in 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 all day here for dinner and you 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.320
 must remember that you must have 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.019
 precisely proteins with Kamchatka are the same 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.290
 vegetables for example I do not know chicken 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.290
 breast 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.430
 lettuce lead lettuce and tomatoes cucumbers not 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.709
 I know for me it is very tasty and of course 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080
 do not forget about the fruit can not name 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.269
 have dinner because fruit is carbohydrate and 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.269
 Especially if you do not eat them 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.530
 proteins here are the general hope and very 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.380
 easily and simply explained 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.470
 opened so let's say this topic therefore 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.760
 if you have stopped weight you do not lose weight 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.849
 I do not know maybe you have some 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.860
 problems with making a diet I 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.040
 I advise you to review my video about 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.739
 proteins fats carbohydrates where to get what they are 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.519
 there are about carbohydrates glycemic index 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.849

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.650
