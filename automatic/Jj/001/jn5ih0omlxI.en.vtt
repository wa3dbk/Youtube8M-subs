00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
having some problems so I thought I'd

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.580 
having some problems so I thought I'd
make<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> tutorial<00:00:09.420> video<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:09.900> how<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.050> do<00:00:10.410> that

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
make a tutorial video on how to do that

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.770 
make a tutorial video on how to do that
and<00:00:10.830> yeah<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.820> always<00:00:12.090> all<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> links<00:00:12.690> are

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and yeah as always all the links are

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.450 
and yeah as always all the links are
included<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> description<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.130> will

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
included in the description I will

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
included in the description I will
assume<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.089> use<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.780> factory<00:00:16.230> image<00:00:16.500> here<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
assume you use the factory image here to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.390 
assume you use the factory image here to
actually<00:00:17.609> flash<00:00:18.600> Android<00:00:19.050> 4.3<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.220> going

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
actually flash Android 4.3 so I'm going

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.189 
actually flash Android 4.3 so I'm going
to<00:00:20.460> assume<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.119> guide<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.960> means

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to assume you use my guide which means

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.450 
to assume you use my guide which means
right<00:00:22.410> now<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> probably<00:00:23.010> don't<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
right now you probably don't have a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.859 
right now you probably don't have a
custom<00:00:23.850> recovery<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.359> anything<00:00:24.570> you're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
custom recovery or anything you're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
custom recovery or anything you're
probably<00:00:25.080> completely<00:00:25.590> stocked<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.220> that's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
probably completely stocked so that's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
probably completely stocked so that's
why<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.580> gonna<00:00:26.699> assume<00:00:27.000> I'll<00:00:27.359> show<00:00:27.960> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
why I'm gonna assume I'll show you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
why I'm gonna assume I'll show you
exactly<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> custom<00:00:29.550> recovery<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
exactly how to get a custom recovery and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.139 
exactly how to get a custom recovery and
eventually<00:00:30.750> how<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.170> route<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.009> yeah<00:00:32.730> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
eventually how to get route so yeah you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.819 
eventually how to get route so yeah you
can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.360> right<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.719> Nexus<00:00:34.260> 4<00:00:34.440> doesn't

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
can see right now my Nexus 4 doesn't

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.979 
can see right now my Nexus 4 doesn't
have<00:00:35.010> route<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:36.930> there

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
have route so you can see right there

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
have route so you can see right there
we'll<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.680> through<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
we'll be going through this with you

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.260 
we'll be going through this with you
step<00:00:38.910> by<00:00:39.059> step<00:00:39.410> no<00:00:40.410> root<00:00:40.590> access

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
step by step no root access

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
step by step no root access
so<00:00:42.270> yeah<00:00:42.840> let's<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.200> ahead<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.559> root<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
so yeah let's go ahead and get root I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
so yeah let's go ahead and get root I
will<00:00:44.309> also<00:00:44.489> assume<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
will also assume that you do have the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
will also assume that you do have the
Android<00:00:46.050> SDK<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> Google

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
Android SDK and you do have the Google

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
Android SDK and you do have the Google
USB<00:00:48.300> drivers<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.950> Google

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
USB drivers if you don't just Google

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
USB drivers if you don't just Google
those<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:50.760> things<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.360> much<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
those two things it's pretty much the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
those two things it's pretty much the
first<00:00:51.870> link<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.199> pops<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.980> yeah<00:00:53.460> let's<00:00:53.670> go

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
first link that pops up so yeah let's go

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
first link that pops up so yeah let's go
ahead<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.629> always<00:00:55.230> all

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
ahead and get on with it as always all

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.900 
ahead and get on with it as always all
the<00:00:55.649> links<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> description<00:00:56.610> but
