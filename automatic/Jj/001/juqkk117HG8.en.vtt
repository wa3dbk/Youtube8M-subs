whole<00:03:16.410> way<00:03:16.620> through<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.070> playthrough<00:03:17.310> and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
whole way through this playthrough and

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.750 
whole way through this playthrough and
it's<00:03:17.880> quite<00:03:18.210> hard<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.600> do<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.020> runes<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
it's quite hard to do the runes and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.900
