LaRue and Rapinoe you know they've got

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.950

Kim<00:00:21.199> little<00:00:21.500> in<00:00:21.619> midfield<00:00:22.420> Fishlock<00:00:23.420> in

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
Kim little in midfield Fishlock in

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.880 
Kim little in midfield Fishlock in
midfield<00:00:23.840> I<00:00:24.109> mean<00:00:24.230> they're<00:00:24.380> just<00:00:24.410> they're

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
midfield I mean they're just they're

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.790 
midfield I mean they're just they're
loaded<00:00:25.310> offensively<00:00:25.429> I<00:00:26.000> think<00:00:26.359> so<00:00:26.990> it's<00:00:27.590> going

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
loaded offensively I think so it's going

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.130 
loaded offensively I think so it's going
to<00:00:27.830> be<00:00:28.039> a<00:00:28.429> very<00:00:29.000> difficult<00:00:29.240> task<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:29.929> a<00:00:29.990> big

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
to be a very difficult task and a big

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.749 
to be a very difficult task and a big
challenge<00:00:30.380> for<00:00:30.589> our<00:00:30.740> back<00:00:30.949> line<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:31.460> our<00:00:31.550> team

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
challenge for our back line and our team

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.270 
challenge for our back line and our team
defensively<00:00:32.270> for<00:00:32.480> sure<00:00:32.660> going<00:00:32.989> in<00:00:33.219> but<00:00:34.219> I

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
defensively for sure going in but I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.479 
defensively for sure going in but I
think<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:34.719> hopefully<00:00:35.719> we<00:00:36.079> can<00:00:36.260> create<00:00:37.250> some

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
think that hopefully we can create some

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.310 
think that hopefully we can create some
problems<00:00:37.520> for<00:00:37.850> them<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.329> on<00:00:38.600> their<00:00:38.870> defensive

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
problems for them to on their defensive

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.350 
problems for them to on their defensive
side<00:00:39.469> of<00:00:39.620> things<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:39.980> think<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.340> we've<00:00:41.210> got

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
side of things I think that we've got

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.150 
side of things I think that we've got
enough<00:00:41.600> attacking<00:00:42.200> firepower<00:00:42.649> okay

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
enough attacking firepower okay

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.920 
enough attacking firepower okay
hopefully<00:00:43.760> create<00:00:44.180> enough<00:00:44.420> chances<00:00:44.780> for

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
hopefully create enough chances for

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.630 
hopefully create enough chances for
ourselves<00:00:45.020> longer<00:00:45.559> on<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:45.770> road<00:00:45.949> there<00:00:46.190> it's

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
ourselves longer on the road there it's

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.450 
ourselves longer on the road there it's
a<00:00:46.699> huge<00:00:46.940> thing<00:00:46.969> for<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.539> new<00:00:47.780> franchise<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:48.829> think

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
a huge thing for a new franchise I think

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.880 
a huge thing for a new franchise I think
to<00:00:49.640> gain<00:00:50.180> some<00:00:50.420> confidence<00:00:50.600> after<00:00:51.230> after

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
to gain some confidence after after

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.610 
to gain some confidence after after
losing<00:00:52.309> at<00:00:52.399> home<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.609> portland<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:54.170> i<00:00:54.350> think

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
losing at home to portland and i think

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.709 
losing at home to portland and i think
it<00:00:54.770> was<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:55.010> really<00:00:55.219> big<00:00:55.430> first<00:00:55.730> step<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:56.090> the

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
it was a really big first step is the

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.660 
it was a really big first step is the
team<00:00:56.899> showed<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.140> lot<00:00:57.289> of<00:00:57.320> character<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:58.460> never

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
team showed a lot of character we never

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.700 
team showed a lot of character we never
gave<00:00:58.820> up<00:00:58.879> for<00:00:59.180> one<00:00:59.300> second<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.710> theresa

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
gave up for one second and theresa

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.160 
gave up for one second and theresa
played<00:01:01.070> wonderful<00:01:01.489> Rafa<00:01:01.910> came<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.420> did

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
played wonderful Rafa came in and did

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.320 
played wonderful Rafa came in and did
great<00:01:03.320> for<00:01:03.530> us<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.190> think<00:01:04.520> obviously<00:01:04.850> Ellis

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
great for us and I think obviously Ellis

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.750 
great for us and I think obviously Ellis
goal<00:01:05.510> made<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.750> big<00:01:05.900> difference<00:01:06.050> so<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:07.490> us<00:01:07.550> it

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
goal made a big difference so for us it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
goal made a big difference so for us it
was<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.880> big<00:01:08.090> learning<00:01:08.210> game<00:01:08.510> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
was a big learning game and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
was a big learning game and
we<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.409> watched<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.190> video<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> lot<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
we I watched a lot of video a lot of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.039 
we I watched a lot of video a lot of
girls<00:01:11.790> left<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> lot<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> video<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
girls left a lot of video we're going to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
girls left a lot of video we're going to
meet<00:01:13.409> about<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> tomorrow<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> new

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
meet about it tomorrow and this is a new

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
meet about it tomorrow and this is a new
team<00:01:15.510> so<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> growing<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> do

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
team so we have a lot of growing to do

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
team so we have a lot of growing to do
but<00:01:16.860> i<00:01:17.010> really<00:01:17.220> look<00:01:17.250> forward<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.610> seattle<00:01:18.509> i

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
but i really look forward to seattle i

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
but i really look forward to seattle i
think<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.040> probably<00:01:20.040> less<00:01:20.460> than<00:01:20.520> others<00:01:20.940> right

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
think is probably less than others right

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330 
think is probably less than others right
now<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:21.990> still<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.770> better<00:01:22.920> at

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
now well still we got to be better at

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.770 
now well still we got to be better at
keeping<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> ball<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> still

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
keeping the ball more you know I still

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
keeping the ball more you know I still
think<00:01:24.990> our<00:01:25.080> possession<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.920> improved<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
think our possession can get improved I

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.300 
think our possession can get improved I
think<00:01:27.030> we'll<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> call<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.680> times<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
think we'll get a call at times on the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.249 
think we'll get a call at times on the
flanks<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> ball<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.390> we've<00:01:30.540> got<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.170> be

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
flanks with the ball and we've got to be

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
flanks with the ball and we've got to be
smarter<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.880> letting<00:01:33.149> teams

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
smarter about that and not letting teams

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.719 
smarter about that and not letting teams
trap<00:01:33.720> us<00:01:33.899> out<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.200> wide<00:01:34.380> areas<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.610> we've

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
trap us out in wide areas I think we've

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.280 
trap us out in wide areas I think we've
still<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.180> better<00:01:36.330> up<00:01:36.600> front<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.080> think

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
still got to be better up front I think

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
still got to be better up front I think
we<00:01:37.409> haven't<00:01:37.770> gotten<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.540> chemistry<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
we haven't gotten the chemistry in the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.749
