well<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.369> made<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.670> own<00:01:08.760> extension<00:01:09.390> cable

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
well and I made my own extension cable

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020 
well and I made my own extension cable
that's<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> light<00:01:10.860> socket<00:01:11.159> fir<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> plugs

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that's is a light socket fir that plugs

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.440 
that's is a light socket fir that plugs
into<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.390> motorhome<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.110> 2<00:01:14.180> 1141<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.210> then

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
into my motorhome this 2 1141 and then

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
into my motorhome this 2 1141 and then
it's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> DC<00:01:16.049> barrel<00:01:16.320> connector<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.710> saw<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.040> on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it's a DC barrel connector I saw it on

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
it's a DC barrel connector I saw it on
the<00:01:17.369> other<00:01:17.520> end<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.939> might<00:01:18.509> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the other end you might want to go to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.179 
the other end you might want to go to
Radio<00:01:19.110> Shack<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> screw<00:01:20.130> on

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
Radio Shack and get one of the screw on

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.920 
Radio Shack and get one of the screw on
terminals<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> verify<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.780> the

polarity<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.670> ordered<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.820> LED<00:01:24.240> light<00:01:24.420> kit

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
polarity I ordered a LED light kit

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.850 
polarity I ordered a LED light kit
because<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.080> thought<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.650> easy

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
because I thought I was going to be easy

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
because I thought I was going to be easy
and<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> little

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and there is actually this little

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
and there is actually this little
resistor<00:01:28.710> thing<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> messed<00:01:29.700> up

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
resistor thing in there that messed up

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
resistor thing in there that messed up
the<00:01:30.000> voltage<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:31.079> amperage<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.100> couldn't

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the voltage or amperage so it couldn't

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.440 
the voltage or amperage so it couldn't
get<00:01:32.430> enough<00:01:33.420> power<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> straight

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
get enough power so just get a straight

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.490 
get enough power so just get a straight

whatever your light is in your outside
porch<00:01:38.009> light<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:39.600> wire<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:41.060> DC

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
porch light and then wire it up to a DC

I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> scotch<00:01:54.000> tape<00:01:54.090> will<00:01:54.360> hold<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I think the scotch tape will hold it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
I think the scotch tape will hold it
just<00:01:54.720> fine<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.740> here's<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> outside<00:01:56.210> as<00:01:57.210> you
