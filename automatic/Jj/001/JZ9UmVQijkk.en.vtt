00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
a go you get hold further down you push

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.980 
a go you get hold further down you push
this<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.280> faster<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.759> go<00:01:55.940> can<00:01:56.509> go<00:01:56.539> up<00:01:56.840> to

this<00:02:31.220> for<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> couple<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.700> weeks<00:02:31.909> now<00:02:32.030> city

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
this for a couple of weeks now city

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.630 
this for a couple of weeks now city
country<00:02:32.959> all<00:02:33.230> different<00:02:33.560> terrain<00:02:33.830> nice<00:02:34.400> thing

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
country all different terrain nice thing

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.220 
country all different terrain nice thing
about<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.120> suspension<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.050> some

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
about it's a suspension you have some

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
about it's a suspension you have some
suspension<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.099> which<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.580> key<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.150> when

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
suspension on it which is key in when

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.550 
suspension on it which is key in when
you've<00:02:38.569> got<00:02:38.720> these<00:02:38.810> small<00:02:38.959> little<00:02:39.379> wheels

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
you've got these small little wheels

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.500 
you've got these small little wheels
these<00:02:40.159> are<00:02:40.220> also<00:02:40.430> rubber<00:02:40.760> wheels<00:02:41.000> don't<00:02:41.300> take

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
these are also rubber wheels don't take

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.089 
these are also rubber wheels don't take
any<00:02:41.690> air<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.170> them<00:02:42.349> so<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.709> not<00:02:42.800> like<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
any air in them so it's not like you

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.589 
any air in them so it's not like you
have<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.340> lot<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.550> give<00:02:43.849> when<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.090> hit<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.390> bump

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
have a lot of give when you hit the bump

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.720 
have a lot of give when you hit the bump
so<00:02:44.900> if<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.590> hit<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.800> major<00:02:46.040> bump<00:02:46.370> you're<00:02:46.550> still

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
so if you hit a major bump you're still

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.520 
so if you hit a major bump you're still
going<00:02:46.909> to<00:02:47.000> feel<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> fact<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.230> has

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
going to feel it but the fact that has

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.680 
going to feel it but the fact that has
some<00:02:48.680> additional<00:02:49.069> suspension<00:02:49.909> in<00:02:50.000> here<00:02:50.269> at

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
some additional suspension in here at

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.360 
some additional suspension in here at
least<00:02:50.930> helps<00:02:51.230> smooth<00:02:51.440> out<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.830> ride<00:02:51.950> now

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
least helps smooth out the ride now

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.589 
least helps smooth out the ride now

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
it in this like I said without a lot of

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.630 
it in this like I said without a lot of
air<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.440> tires<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.980> those<00:02:58.069> small<00:02:58.220> tires

air in the tires and those small tires

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.910 
air in the tires and those small tires
not<00:02:58.940> much<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.390> do<00:02:59.510> about<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.680> we<00:03:00.769> do

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
you bring this down folds down like that

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.800 
you bring this down folds down like that
and<00:04:53.400> then<00:04:53.610> this<00:04:53.760> is<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.210> click<00:04:54.630> into

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
and then this is going to click into

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.070 
and then this is going to click into
place<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.770> watch<00:04:55.949> this<00:04:56.310> but<00:04:57.270> its<00:04:57.419> kickstand<00:04:57.930> up

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
place so watch this but its kickstand up

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.409 
place so watch this but its kickstand up
and<00:04:58.289> then<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:58.770> pick<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.010> up<00:04:59.250> as<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.150> see<00:05:00.300> it's

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
and then you pick it up as you see it's

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.939 
and then you pick it up as you see it's
pretty<00:05:00.449> portable<00:05:00.930> like<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.380> said<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.889> about

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
pretty portable like I said it's about

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.210 
pretty portable like I said it's about
32<00:05:02.639> 33<00:05:03.300> pounds<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.289> it's<00:05:04.470> not<00:05:04.650> light<00:05:04.949> and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
32 33 pounds so it's not light and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.260 
32 33 pounds so it's not light and
that's<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.789> battery<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.240> have

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
that's because of the battery you have

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.939 
that's because of the battery you have
in<00:05:06.599> here<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.380> can<00:05:07.530> definitely<00:05:07.860> throw

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
in here but you can definitely throw

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.649 
in here but you can definitely throw
this<00:05:08.130> in<00:05:08.280> your<00:05:08.370> trunk<00:05:08.580> can<00:05:09.090> take<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.389> up<00:05:09.479> some

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
this in your trunk can take it up some

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.899 
this in your trunk can take it up some
stairs<00:05:09.930> so<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.320> portability<00:05:11.190> we<00:05:11.639> think<00:05:11.820> is<00:05:11.880> a

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
stairs so that portability we think is a

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.020 
stairs so that portability we think is a
big<00:05:12.150> deal<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.389> this<00:05:12.630> m5<00:05:13.550> alright<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:14.760> let<00:05:14.940> me

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
big deal on this m5 alright so let me

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.490 
big deal on this m5 alright so let me
give<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.240> our<00:05:15.389> overall<00:05:15.870> thoughts<00:05:16.199> after

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.050 
incredible with this compared to when I
Drive<00:05:24.300> my<00:05:24.360> car<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.990> work<00:05:25.139> with<00:05:25.650> this<00:05:25.909> $1<00:05:26.909> of

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
Drive my car to work with this $1 of

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.850 
Drive my car to work with this $1 of
electricity<00:05:27.449> I<00:05:27.780> get<00:05:28.020> five<00:05:28.260> hundred<00:05:28.470> miles

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
electricity I get five hundred miles

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.159 
electricity I get five hundred miles
that's<00:05:29.610> effectively<00:05:30.120> about<00:05:30.449> two<00:05:30.720> thousand

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
that's effectively about two thousand

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.839 
that's effectively about two thousand
miles<00:05:31.349> to<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.770> gallon<00:05:31.979> this<00:05:32.460> thing<00:05:32.669> did<00:05:32.820> you

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
miles to the gallon this thing did you

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.360 
miles to the gallon this thing did you
scat<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.539> fact<00:05:33.840> that<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.349> can<00:05:34.830> do<00:05:34.949> that<00:05:35.130> not

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
scat so the fact that I can do that not

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.070 
scat so the fact that I can do that not
jump<00:05:35.639> in<00:05:35.760> my<00:05:35.880> car<00:05:35.909> I<00:05:36.180> can<00:05:36.240> drive<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.960> from
