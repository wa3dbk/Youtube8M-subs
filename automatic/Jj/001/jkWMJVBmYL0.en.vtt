hi<00:00:00.539> let's<00:00:01.439> learn<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:01.800> numbers<00:00:02.159> numerals

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi let's learn about numbers numerals

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.019 
hi let's learn about numbers numerals
and<00:00:03.330> digits<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.250> number<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.400> account<00:00:05.819> or

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
and digits a number is account or

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.299 
and digits a number is account or
measurement<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.170> really<00:00:07.470> an<00:00:07.560> idea<00:00:07.950> in

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
measurement that is really an idea in

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.560 
measurement that is really an idea in
our<00:00:08.460> minds

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
our minds

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.169 
our minds
here<00:00:11.559> are<00:00:11.679> some<00:00:11.860> different<00:00:12.340> ways<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:12.760> show<00:00:13.000> the

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
here are some different ways to show the

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.810 
here are some different ways to show the
number<00:00:13.450> four<00:00:13.840> we<00:00:14.709> could<00:00:14.860> even<00:00:14.980> tap<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:15.580> ground

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
number four we could even tap the ground

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.070 
number four we could even tap the ground
four<00:00:16.180> times<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:19.029> are<00:00:19.150> also<00:00:19.360> special

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
four times there are also special

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.380 
four times there are also special
numbers<00:00:20.410> like<00:00:20.800> pi<00:00:21.070> that<00:00:21.580> can't<00:00:21.880> be<00:00:21.970> written

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
numbers like pi that can't be written

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.960 
numbers like pi that can't be written
exactly<00:00:22.930> but<00:00:23.680> are<00:00:23.770> still<00:00:23.980> numbers<00:00:24.490> because<00:00:24.939> we

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
exactly but are still numbers because we

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
exactly but are still numbers because we
know<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.480> idea<00:00:25.840> behind<00:00:26.110> them<00:00:27.630> numerals<00:00:28.630> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
know the idea behind them numerals a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.519 
know the idea behind them numerals a
numeral<00:00:30.220> is<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.369> symbol<00:00:30.910> or<00:00:31.300> name<00:00:31.750> that<00:00:32.140> stands

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
numeral is a symbol or name that stands

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.000 
numeral is a symbol or name that stands
for<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.860> number

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
for a number

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240 
for a number
so<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> number<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.690> idea<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.590> numeral<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so the number is an idea the numeral is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
so the number is an idea the numeral is
how<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.579> write<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:41.450> digits<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.920> digit<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
how we write it digits a digit is a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.970 
how we write it digits a digit is a
single<00:00:44.670> symbol<00:00:45.000> used<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:45.989> numerals

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.600 

we<00:00:51.730> can<00:00:51.880> put<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.150> digits<00:00:52.510> 1<00:00:52.900> 5<00:00:53.500> &amp;<00:00:53.890> 3<00:00:53.950> together

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
we can put the digits 1 5 &amp; 3 together

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.650 
we can put the digits 1 5 &amp; 3 together
to<00:00:55.390> make<00:00:55.770> 153<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:58.230> 153<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.470> numeral<00:01:00.220> and<00:01:00.340> 1<00:01:01.120> 5

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
to make 153 so 153 is a numeral and 1 5

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.210 
to make 153 so 153 is a numeral and 1 5
&amp;<00:01:02.020> 3<00:01:02.050> are<00:01:02.740> digits<00:01:04.170> another<00:01:05.170> example<00:01:05.710> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
&amp; 3 are digits another example the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.140 
&amp; 3 are digits another example the
numeral<00:01:06.640> 9<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.300> made<00:01:07.660> up<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.260> digit<00:01:08.650> 9<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:10.120> a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
numeral 9 is made up of one digit 9 so a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
numeral 9 is made up of one digit 9 so a
single<00:01:10.540> digit<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.530> also<00:01:11.740> be<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> numeral

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
single digit can also be a numeral

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.969 
single digit can also be a numeral
summary<00:01:15.810> digits<00:01:16.810> make<00:01:17.110> up<00:01:17.290> numerals<00:01:17.800> and

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
summary digits make up numerals and

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.880 
summary digits make up numerals and
numerals<00:01:18.760> stand<00:01:19.300> for<00:01:19.570> an<00:01:19.690> idea<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.590> number

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
numerals stand for an idea of a number

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.820 
numerals stand for an idea of a number
just<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:22.360> letters<00:01:22.870> make<00:01:23.140> up<00:01:23.320> words<00:01:23.560> and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
just like letters make up words and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.710 
just like letters make up words and
words<00:01:24.369> stand<00:01:25.030> for<00:01:25.240> ideas

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.340 

number<00:01:29.380> instead<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.890> numeral<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.900> often

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
number instead of numeral people often

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.120 
number instead of numeral people often
use<00:01:32.620> number<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.490> numeral<00:01:34.330> as<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.870> same<00:01:35.080> thing

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
use number and numeral as the same thing

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.400 
use number and numeral as the same thing
but<00:01:36.130> try<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.460> use<00:01:36.790> digit<00:01:37.420> only<00:01:37.960> when<00:01:38.110> talking

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
but try to use digit only when talking

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.500 
but try to use digit only when talking
about<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.980> single<00:01:39.430> symbols<00:01:39.910> that<00:01:40.120> make<00:01:40.330> up

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
about the single symbols that make up

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.920 
about the single symbols that make up
numerals<00:01:40.930> okay

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
numerals okay

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.320 
numerals okay
the<00:01:43.930> Romans<00:01:44.380> used<00:01:44.500> Roman<00:01:45.310> numerals<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:45.940> there

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
the Romans used Roman numerals and there
