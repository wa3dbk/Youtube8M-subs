00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.809
 new video 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 Today we open the glossybox together 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.530
 from august 2014 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.150
 and I have already unpacked them 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.040
 She looks a bit like that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.529
 changed by optics so it is now 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.450
 here somehow angular and almer old 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.759
 rosé before it was a bit more than 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.110
 rosé going but free sees the 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.059
 packaging for me right now 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.730
 I'm curious what's in there 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:32.040
 this is the birthday edition of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
 the go eeebox celebrate the birthday and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.980
 I'm curious if they have something 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.839
 come up with something super 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 special something in there maybe 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.190
 for us subscribers and I am pleased 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.749
 Let's go on it's how it looks from the inside 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.609
 as always with the nice little one 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.199
 Grind tied and one 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.120
 product card is here to stand 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.109
 Products that are in there with the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.339
 original prices 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.140
 I'll see that but only at the end 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.850
 That means I'll tell you at the end 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.409
 then also what the things in detail 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.999
 would cost in the original in the 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.379
 original size and if it is one 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.510
 original size is or not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.309
 First, I have a coupon here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 there are 20 percent of the body shop 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.760
 the next time I bought something 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340
 Interesting is on the front 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.720
 discover the new collection argan the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.650
 I find that interesting so I would 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.280
 then probably me too 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.140
 look at 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.140
 both body shop and if it's 20 percent 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.190
 why not so now we come 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
 to the products 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.770
 First, I have a pen here 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.370
 now it runs is a soft alone 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 green 06 from the company la vera bio 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.020
 organic and looks like a whole 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.940
 normal kay but if it is a softer 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.560
 liner should be then I find that completely 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.560
 great I never got to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.580
 but unfortunately I always like me 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 Just do it on the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.490
 back of the hand or the market very gently and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.840
 soft so the color looks a nice 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.070
 forest green not particularly bright 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.600
 Maybe you could look at it 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.430
 confused with dark gray or 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.620
 anthracite or something I do not know though 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.310
 I will like to therefore try to 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.960
 The lower water lilies kaya stroke in 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.090
 color I always find very nice so 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 the first a software liner from avira 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.149
 I think I'm fine then I have 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.260
 here skin care skin bio teacher and four 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.210
 A 24 hours 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.920
 moisture fluid from which company is 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.050
 that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.430
 from susi, I think that's not bad 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.190
 come here with such a point as donor 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.720
 yes I look how much is in it 15 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.820
 Millimeters are included in the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.870
 do not test bad I test it 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.390
 now just on my hand back 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:37.010
 and that's how apricot colors I think 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.690
 very sweet not very pleasant but for 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.230
 itself and would not arrive at me 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.390
 Not at all, not creamy anymore 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.950
 so subtly perfumed but 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 gives off nice moisture I like 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.790
 At first glance, I think so 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.020
 also great 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.200
 then i have a product from the here 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.320
 body shop trade media shower gel go 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.440
 shower 60 milliliters ok I'll try 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.580
 what is that? 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.920
 emphasize that I know that it is the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.830
 company creo load that is actually so 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.350
 somehow got a theatrical makeup company 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.260
 I've seen the libro in many times already 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.690
 the videos that the kreolen with glossy 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.500
 kryolan in front of glossybox highlighter 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.690
 cashmere 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.730
 aha a highlight or I am yes times 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.050
 I was curious to have a holder 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.680
 never in any box I 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.600
 ever had 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.450
 he looks like a tiny little one 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.580
 brains 45 grams are just there 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.400
 but I'm curious now that 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.890
 I make creamy eats on the skin 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.930
 every case and very very discreet though 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.330
 I like it well , I'm fine 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.330
 imagine on the skin great 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.650
 that too is really nice i do not know 7 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.460
 I'm sure to see you in the jews 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.900
 show you that again a 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.710
 close-up looks great in any case 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.360
 Find out and a blow I have here 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.890
 conjured out that is the expiration is 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.480
 the last product in it was me 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.060
 grab box now to the page here 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.030
 is the name of the company so susen skincare koller 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.590
 performance universal blush universal 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.050
 I unpacked it now and shows 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.720
 you the color of the right way 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.630
 solid welded I think so good 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.070
 looks the color it is so 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.780
 he just reminds me of a red one right now 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.750
 gold but I have to see you swatch times 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.720
 how he really is really got one 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.700
 I think the very good ride dues 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.660
 I'm going to look at the outside 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.130
 is a subtle do 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.720
 more while pink genes there I am 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.340
 So he's actually more 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.040
 pink here you see it shows you this 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.990
 twice as well as a very nice tone 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.040
 So a leaf over such a blowpipe me 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.450
 me in the box and also about one 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.400
 highlight because i never have one 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.900
 Highlight in a box I think 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.460
 both very nice for me because this 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.320
 Both products here are the highlights 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.300
 the home director and I totally think so 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.790
 toll can also be very much in 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.470
 I think for the birthday Indian 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.200
 Also a nice idea at that time so pure 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.370
 do I'm really looking forward to it 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.900
 then we come to the short time 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.950
 product card you can do it here 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.200
 fold apart 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.270
 Now I'll tell you the price 45 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.610
 gram is in the koran highlighter in it 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.720
 So is an original product should cost 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.370
 14 euro 50 of susan brac's in here 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.820
 It was also an original product with four 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.220
 gram 15 euro 50 the shower gel from the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.860
 Body shop usually has 250 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.400
 milliliter and costs 6 euro 50 and here 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.290
 are contained 60 milliliters then 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.960
 we have the soft eyeliner from la vera 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.930
 for five euros 95 and then we have that 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.729
 moisture fluid from cecile skin bio 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.540
 That is called and there are in the original 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.640
 product 50 meters in it for 20 euros and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.120
 this is for testing are the 15 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.400
 milliliter 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.050
 I'm completely honest 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.490
 For me the glossybox actually 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.930
 just because of these two products here 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.460
 You can never pay enough blanches 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.190
 I always try to have highlighter 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.900
 like to find out and the other things 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.160
 I do not like it so much 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.840
 you say to the box you have the 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.689
 glossybox also subscribed and what was with 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.309
 that would be your turn 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.319
 Interested are these two products 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:59.539
 contained in each box and the other 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.919
 varies or you have these two 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.449
 products are not in it and have for it 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.189
 something completely different will happen to me now 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.629
 if that's interesting here now, too 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.599
 really the highlight was something with me 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.610
 so as a highlight arrives I have in the 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.349
 box still discovered a sample and indeed 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.860
 from the new fragrance of donna karan new 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.360
 york dpa is one without some present in such 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.369
 a heart of his hearty five 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.019
 totally sweet and I like the advertising so 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.029
 So I like the thora I think so 

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:25.369
 really great anyway 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.929
 and yes I'm curious how the fragrance 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.669
 right here it just a bit 

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:30.079
 it is difficult this little heart that must 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.489
 I probably cut open and then 

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:33.319
 comes out of it all at once I know 

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:34.729
 not as accurate as I test it 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.649
 It should be a bit much for one 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.339
 Europe in front of it all at once I believe 

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.509
 use 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:39.829
 I have to see how I do that 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.079
 handle if I'm looking forward to everyone 

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.529
 If so, try the fragrance 

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:44.689
 can 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.979
 yes I hope an unboxing has you 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.569
 I like you one now 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.279
 he will stay one more day 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.279
 healthy and until next time bye
