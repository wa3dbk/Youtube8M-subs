 and run for work and this steals us 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.909
 time to elaborate our 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.739
 feeding and every day the 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.739
 supermarkets offer us solutions 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.910
 fast in food and those are the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.430

 acute gastritis or chronic gastritis is 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.600
 important to eliminate those foods 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.540
 that increase irritation in the mucosa 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.660

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.970
 rich fish either steamed or 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.569
 roasted today I share one of my recipes 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.320
 favorite ingredients a fish of 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.130
 half a pound a medium carrot a 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.200
 lettuce and a pinch of sea salt 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.810
 preparation let's clean the fish 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.100
 we are going to season it with salt and we take it 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.620
 at 975 degrees we bake for 20 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.200
 minutes apart and we grate the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.660
 carrot and we clean the lettuce the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.150
 we chop something thick and we give back the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.660
 carrot and grated we're going to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.480
 season only with important salt 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.790
 you have to chew very well and the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.580

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.070

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.970
