 I welcome you today on my own 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.010
 fifth lesson and today we knit with you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.700
 whether it is from interlacing punch and either 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 same is called a false openness 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:31.740
 Samples of critique leaves beautiful that is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.489
 instead of holes we have laid 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.620
 thin thread we knit from thick not from 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.270
 thin thread thin thread can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 take with lurex will be very beautiful here 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:54.539
 now we will link this one here 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.079
 I wear a cardigan connected with rhombuses here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.829
 these murmurs would be with you now and I will repeat 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.170
 I have already made a salary 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:12.689
 several rows up to 9 take them to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.930
 left wicket to the electronic car for 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.950
 the electronic sensor took the carriage away 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.810
 I turn on the car I know that I have a drawing 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:28.580
 403 if you punch card you take your 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.580
 punch card and going to drawing 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.710
 prepared for the machine for knitting machine 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.540
 ready now 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 so to read a rarity I put kc-2 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.590
 if on the same map with the agency here to 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 Roman publishing house 2 and spend 13 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 counting no buttons on the carriage 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:02.100
 I do not press except 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 I spend once reading the car is ready for 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.350
 knitting she shows that the first row 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.300
 ready to knit then I click on the carriage 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.239
 two buttons that are responsible for knitting 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.720
 poncho climb on me painted on the car 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:26.970
 two buttons mean and put thin 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.680
 the thread in which the legs of the letter b delivered 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.709
 hold the tail now begin 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.709
 to knit 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.230
 knit little hang cat 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:53.030
 be sure to always hang do not forget 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.050
 that when we picked the needles were taken in 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.170
 work before work we are from zero 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.840
 symmetrically 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.890
 we type loops that is now I have 27 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:20.690
 5 here on this side is right from zero and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:24.880
 27 report width 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.600
 I have 16 loops this pattern and height 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:40.990
 32 rows 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:40.990
 I now see the punch is smart 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:51.220
 Cardigans like my jackets for 30 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 fence 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:06.170
 everything 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:10.010
 no longer want to knit newspapers what i do 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:14.609
 I put the lever on the nose to normal knit 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.959
 this button itself left work became 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:23.009
 died normal position turned off 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.960
 we remove a thin thread it is torn and knit 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.960
 in principle, you can already turn on the machine 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.960
 still punch 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.139
 need to knit of course on more loose 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.070
 density why because we need 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.340
 beautiful drawing 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.099
 so friability should be me 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.320
 devyatochka thread not. 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.509
 density is also calculated for both threads 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.910
 since they both canoe both 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:55.889
 it is boundlessly like thread 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.780
 further I when we are thin thread in nete 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.740
 the driver spent 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.150
 we are sure to twist the plates 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.030
 surely for a thin thread 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.789
 there is more tightly we twist we cut off the canvas 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:14.310
 we remove cargo from the car 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:18.530
 cut by and see what else we have 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:23.190
 have not forgotten to twist the heads 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.830
 thread tensioners to our little plates for 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.039
 fine thread 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:34.340
 she will never fly out well with us 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.340
 cut the thread 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:49.210
 and cut the cut thread too simpa 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:53.040
 very soft though acrylic is very similar 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:57.960
 on the nome her cheek is soft nice and 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.960
 Here we have a sample 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.960
 Thank you for your attention to new meetings and to 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.960
