00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.520
 freddy video mixed to all in 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.589
 which I will explain to you how 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.269
 create the pose of a stent it on skin 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 human and that it is sustainable 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.830
 the whole voting period at any age for 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.039
 this is very simple you get a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.930
 hand cleaning gel that will help 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 degrease your skin before the break 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 of utensils then you get a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 stencil stuf or other allowing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 put your carbon on the skin you 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 have your carbon paper and you have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.309
 your paper that removes the surplus 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 of products on the skin we go 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.219
 to do the procedure it's very simple 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 we put a nut on the skin and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.410
 we have the heels history of degreasing 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.780
 the skin is to allow the steles if it 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:02.070
 to hold tightly let us dry 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 the skin a short moment when the skin 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 is very dry we put a nutty 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:16.979
 stencil on the skin and we come 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.460
 to do the same we make it penetrate to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.939
 inside the skin and then we 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.020
 let's put the carbon paper and the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.020
 to make lasting hold 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 we leave for a short time and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.930
 we come to ask our sheet on the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.930
 skin at the desired location by the person 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.350
 it is simply put it starts to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 stick and we just put the sides and we 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.390
 gives a pressure of 5 seconds on 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.530
 to make it completely adhered to us 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.799
 let's drop our paper and we come 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.799
 take off the edges 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.510
 the carbon is laid on the skin we 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.629
 let's take our paper from us 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.709
 let's put it on this skin we 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:23.049
 give pressure we do not wipe but 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.830
 we put a pressure we take off our 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.349
 paper the excesses are gone let's 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.680
 to dry this skin for about 10 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.769
 at 15 minutes it is completely 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.290
 absorbed and you have your stencil ready 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.099
 for the tattoo 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.349
 I hope I was very clear in 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.260
