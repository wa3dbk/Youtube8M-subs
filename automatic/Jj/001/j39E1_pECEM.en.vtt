00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.010
 And there, guys, I'm on the cipher. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.630
 is sea and today I will teach you the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.390
 beginner version of fashion music 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.980
 skin band nights this music tuned 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.750
 Half way down I'm going to pass the tuning 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.890
 for us to play together but 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.010
 after everyone learns can 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.150
 after all, guitar usually the sixth string 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:39.680
 deceased in E flat the fifth string 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:44.629
 tuned in there minor the fourth string 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:49.160
 tuned in revealed the third string 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:53.149
 tuned in over mall the second rope 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.260
 tuned on top of the bike and the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.260
 mimon final rope 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.769
 the chords of the introduction of the first 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.769
 part are only major play in the year 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.520
 The smaller the seventh- largest mistake is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520
 bigger 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.970
 stays like this 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.080
 the rhythm of this song full of variations 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.840
 but at this time I'm going to teach a pattern 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.340
 that we will repeat the whole song 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.570
 so with your thumb 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.300
 we played the ropes and the zone there is and with the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.600
 indicator touch the rope only average 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 wake up and look there when the neighbor 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:35.130
 I'll show a rhythm once slowly 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:36.630
 and after teaching that does thing 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.670
 important is to stay connected in the ball 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.530
 appears on the accord diagram . 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.990
 that indicate which string should be played 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:50.220
 low cut, for example not only larger 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:52.620
 bass is played in the rope mi zone then 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.240
 starting with the largest sun court 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.540
 we will play at the same time 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.540
 strings my zone is only so 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.810
 then with the index finger we touch a 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.810
 played on the first three strings 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:30.260
 and to close the pace we will give a 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:31.940
 beat the ropes so we'll go 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.640
 play this same rhythm of the whole song 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.070
 in the first part is to double-tap the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.350
 sun major chords with canvas and there 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.780
 smaller with the seventh and once a chord 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.780
 of greater error C is most well 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.120
 a detail that from the most 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.560
 interesting is to switch the bass 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.909
 accord but because we touch 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.299
 biggest sun chords 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.299
 like this 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.989
 notice when you play the first time I give 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.100
 down the rope my zone and the second time 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.100
 He came back down the block there. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:35.340
 in the second part the chords are smaller me 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:38.560
 there smaller with seventh is bigger 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.020
 only greater 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:48.280
 only with the 7th 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.280
 the largest and the smallest 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:05:05.669
 Come on, you show me fashion. 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:20.580
 The sun that has my third year. 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 big Foot 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.659
 the third part we will play the 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:40.629
 following strings in greater sun is greater 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.629
 in my youth 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:50.590
 this smaller C major in A minor with seven 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:06:17.270
 the third part so I am 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:39.330
 to go to the third part we play the 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.690
 rhythm four times on a string of lonely 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.210
 largest of the largest double in the back quota 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.920
 greater in there minor with seventh and a single 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.710
 the minor chords 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.330
 this minor in the chorus chords and rhythm 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.960
 are the same as the introduction of the first 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.410
 part 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.410
 look that 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.160
 it's fashion there 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.160
 get out of anger 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.610
 in the same rhythm as the introduction and 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.320
 after the cutting end of the settler 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.639
 people will play one down at court 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.639
 from there minor to seventh 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.039
 one down is greater 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.720
 and then send two beats from both the 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:37.789
 guitar 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.500
 so with your thumb 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:53.330
 We hit two beats very close to the 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:54.740
 thank you thank you
