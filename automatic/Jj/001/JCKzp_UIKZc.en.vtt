00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
Clinton and Kosovo but he went to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.889 
Clinton and Kosovo but he went to
Congress<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.430> funding<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.479> used<00:01:54.689> as

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
Congress for funding so that was used as

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.440 
Congress for funding so that was used as
kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.229> an<00:01:55.770> excuse<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.460> him<00:01:56.610> were<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
kind of an excuse of him were so do you

think<00:01:57.600> Obama<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.380> taking<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.130> step

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
think Obama is taking this one step

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
think Obama is taking this one step
further<00:01:59.399> with<00:02:00.240> having<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.719> gone<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> Congress

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
further with having not gone to Congress

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.039 
further with having not gone to Congress
in<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.469> time<00:02:01.619> frame<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.780> think<00:02:03.780> he<00:02:03.869> definitely

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
in that time frame I think he definitely

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
in that time frame I think he definitely
did<00:02:04.500> he<00:02:04.649> has<00:02:04.770> clearly<00:02:05.040> violated<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> War
