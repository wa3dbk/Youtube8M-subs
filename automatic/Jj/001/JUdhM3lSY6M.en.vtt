a<00:02:00.030> hundred<00:02:00.270> percent<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.049> will<00:02:01.530> give<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
a hundred percent here I will give it a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.880 
a hundred percent here I will give it a
go<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.320> don't<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
go and see but I really don't think it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
go and see but I really don't think it
will<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.540> need<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.719> mid<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.259> well

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
will and I think I need a mid as well

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.820 
will and I think I need a mid as well
because<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> needs<00:02:08.310> frozen<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:10.259> know<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
because it needs frozen or you know the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.670 
because it needs frozen or you know the
big<00:02:11.459> news<00:02:11.700> thing<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.209> q4<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> needs<00:02:12.900> frozen

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
big news thing and I q4 it needs frozen

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
big news thing and I q4 it needs frozen
I<00:02:13.709> think<00:02:14.189> one<00:02:14.400> drops<00:02:14.670> from<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.299> well<00:02:15.329> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I think one drops from it as well and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.750 
I think one drops from it as well and
that<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.799> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.159> fun<00:02:17.370> time<00:02:17.579> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that is not going to be a fun time so

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.099
