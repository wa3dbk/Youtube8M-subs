00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 Today's videos on halloween again 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.400
 tutorial though my third if the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.349
 other two have not seen 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.719
 then i lose a lot of box and am 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 end could see again and that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.859
 Today it is one for boys it can 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 Of course, everyone complains, too 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.029
 Here are the guys who wanted me to think 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 There are so many tutorials for me that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.740
 but guys illegal 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.779
 that 's just totally easy you need 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.759
 actually only two things if you stop 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 Of course, having more than one is easier 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
 It sure will be white color and black 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.680
 and then it's magical and there I am 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.239
 kinda totally cool team 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.860
 and yes, I do not have it myself 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.850
 but I have with others 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.469
 already seen and then I told myself 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.090
 I also taste it after I have 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.010
 won a bit and so it could 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.390
 indeed do what you will, it remains 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 has always occurred so I could 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 now simply part says yes then remains 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 I hope you like it and if so 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 yes then stay tuned and look at that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.229
 to be made up and read a lot afterwards 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.420
 fun as the first creamy video that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.600
 Now do not face it later 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 it gets so dry when you do the make-up 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 I then either take one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.259
 white and so small because they are too 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.240
 example here or just an account 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.369
 meaty the cisco meatier wants 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 could also take this theatrical make-up 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.560
 and you can just do the whole half 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560
 of weight 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.240
 the black simple kajal and do 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.740
 just the whole lines before the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.690
 We then play with the black and 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.310
 so and do now with a few years 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 then easier to get away with with one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.760
 gel one and later I use 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.450
 in kehl eyeliner and just fill it 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.450
 everything out 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.150
 Now namely the black eyeshadow 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.180
 very black eyeshadow and would now 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.990
 Outside of Rome, that 's not how it is 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.990
 looks awesome 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.789
 Euro 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.410
 now I go again, the white and 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.120
 the teeth are even further out of you 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.120
 just really want white muslims 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.920
 then when I finished I actually 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.750
 forgot after knowing the instructions 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.340
 Coding off to powder that one has to 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.970
 not necessarily make but thus holds 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.970
 the firmer and yes it looks good 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.689
 then we hope you like it 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.250
 has for the guys under you so the 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.139
 do not know what to do with halloween 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.909
 and you can make-up yourself today 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.710
 It's just plain white 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:32.530
 color black kohl eye shadow or 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.370
 eyeliner and that was and is not so 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.430
 hard or you could even you 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:44.889
 maybe even faster 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:50.289
 maybe and body of water detail really 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:52.960
 so yes and then we hope that it is me 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.969
 you liked and then we'll meet 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.590
 next time perhaps even 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:58.590
 come more often
