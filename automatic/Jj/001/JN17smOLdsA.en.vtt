hi<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.199> yolanda<00:00:01.709> vanveen<00:00:01.740> and<00:00:02.490> in<00:00:02.610> this

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:03.000> I'm<00:00:03.210> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> talk<00:00:03.600> about<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
segment I'm going to talk about how to

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.639 
segment I'm going to talk about how to
propagate<00:00:04.740> from<00:00:05.279> leaf<00:00:05.609> cuttings<00:00:06.230> now<00:00:07.230> plants

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
propagate from leaf cuttings now plants

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.200 
propagate from leaf cuttings now plants
grow<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.280> many<00:00:08.370> different<00:00:08.730> ways<00:00:08.849> where

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
grow in so many different ways where

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.839 
grow in so many different ways where
they<00:00:09.240> replant<00:00:09.660> them<00:00:09.719> by<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> bulb<00:00:10.290> or<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.650> seed<00:00:11.099> or

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
they replant them by a bulb or a seed or

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.150 
they replant them by a bulb or a seed or
you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.240> also<00:00:12.420> start<00:00:12.840> many<00:00:13.230> plants<00:00:13.710> by<00:00:13.860> leaf

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
you can also start many plants by leaf

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.369 
you can also start many plants by leaf
cuttings<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.120> by<00:00:15.210> taking<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.630> part<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.289> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
cuttings it's just by taking a part of a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.700 
cuttings it's just by taking a part of a
plant<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.980> leaf<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.260> restarting<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.529> its

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
plant a leaf and restarting it on its

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620 
plant a leaf and restarting it on its
own<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> whole<00:00:20.640> new<00:00:20.820> plant<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.480> it's

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
own to make a whole new plant so it's

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.670 
own to make a whole new plant so it's
really<00:00:21.900> quite<00:00:22.140> simple

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
really quite simple

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.980 
really quite simple
now<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.519> hanging<00:00:23.880> plant<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.570> started

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
now this hanging plant was just started

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.439 
now this hanging plant was just started
from<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.439> leaf<00:00:25.800> cutting<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.820> rule<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> thumb

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
from a leaf cutting and a rule of thumb

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.200 
from a leaf cutting and a rule of thumb
is<00:00:27.779> never<00:00:28.140> cut<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> plant<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> ground<00:00:29.699> only

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is never cut a plant to the ground only

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.720 
is never cut a plant to the ground only
cut<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.080> leaf<00:00:31.289> where<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> meets<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
cut the leaf where it meets up to the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.729 
cut the leaf where it meets up to the
point<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.120> another<00:00:33.450> plant<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.620> you're

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
point of another plant and when you're

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.650 
point of another plant and when you're
cutting<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> make<00:00:35.430> sure<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.000> cut<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> at<00:00:36.480> an

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
cutting it make sure and cut it at an

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.920 
cutting it make sure and cut it at an
angle<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.730> then<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> way<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.600> its

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
angle and then that way it will make its

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.330 
angle and then that way it will make its
own<00:00:40.110> plant<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.790> good<00:00:42.450> way<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.649> start<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.129> is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
own plant and a good way to start it is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340 
own plant and a good way to start it is
to<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> soil<00:00:45.930> where

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
to put it right back in the soil where

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.770 
to put it right back in the soil where
you<00:00:46.559> found<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> it'll<00:00:47.910> start<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> new<00:00:48.480> plant

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you found it and it'll start a new plant

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.830 
you found it and it'll start a new plant
but<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> found<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.550> putting<00:00:50.910> some<00:00:51.180> type<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but I found by putting some type of a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
but I found by putting some type of a
rooting<00:00:52.320> element<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> bottom<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.000> grows

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
rooting element on the bottom it grows

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
rooting element on the bottom it grows
much<00:00:54.690> quicker<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> much<00:00:55.440> easier<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> found

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
much quicker and much easier so I found

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.470 
much quicker and much easier so I found
that<00:00:57.480> honey<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> best<00:00:58.949> root

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
that honey is one of the best root

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
that honey is one of the best root
toners<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.960> use<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.129> works

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
toners that you can use because it works

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
toners that you can use because it works
so<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.120> gives<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> plant<00:01:03.780> sugar<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so well it gives the plant sugar and it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.469 
so well it gives the plant sugar and it
also<00:01:05.369> gives<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> something<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> grab<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
also gives it something to grab on to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.270 
also gives it something to grab on to
and<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.530> put<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:07.979> bit<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and all I do is put a little bit of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.120 
and all I do is put a little bit of
honey<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> shot<00:01:09.030> glass<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.780> easy<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.200 

and<00:01:14.720> then<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.869> take<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> plant<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.130> where<00:01:18.060> I've

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and then I take the plant and where I've

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.670 
and then I take the plant and where I've
cut<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.659> I'll<00:01:18.990> dip<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> honey

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
cut it I'll dip it right into that honey

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
cut it I'll dip it right into that honey
so<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.670> honey<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
so that there's a little bit of honey on

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.469 
so that there's a little bit of honey on
the<00:01:24.240> end<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.670> turn<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the end and then I turn around and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
the end and then I turn around and
either<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> same<00:01:28.740> pot<00:01:28.950> or

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
either put it right in the same pot or

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.810 
either put it right in the same pot or
start<00:01:29.520> more<00:01:30.240> containers<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.460> put

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
start more containers you can also put

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.819 
start more containers you can also put
them<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.060> seed<00:01:33.390> trays<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> plants

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
them in seed trays and get the plants

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
them in seed trays and get the plants
going<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> once<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.030> good

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
going and once they have a really good

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
going and once they have a really good
root<00:01:36.540> established<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.409> replant<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
root established then replant them but a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
root established then replant them but a
lot<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.390> times<00:01:39.600> even<00:01:39.750> within<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> plant<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
lot of times even within the plant just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
lot of times even within the plant just
to<00:01:40.890> make<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> fuller<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.899> put<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to make it fuller I will just put it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.039 
to make it fuller I will just put it
right<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> soil<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.869> way

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
right back in the soil and then that way

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.440 
right back in the soil and then that way
it'll<00:01:46.439> grow<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.920> away<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> do

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it'll grow right away and you can do
