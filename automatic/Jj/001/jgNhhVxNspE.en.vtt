used<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.830> tracing<00:00:32.130> I've<00:00:33.030> named<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
used in tracing I've named it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
used in tracing I've named it
manipulation<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.890> may<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> different

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
manipulation it may have a different

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.280 
manipulation it may have a different

the<00:00:40.860> concept<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> same<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:42.149> tracing<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the concept is the same as tracing you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
the concept is the same as tracing you
don't<00:00:43.739> hump<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.090> we're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.360> to

start off with your right arm or left
arm<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:48.030> I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> mirrored<00:00:49.920> free

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
arm out I'm going to do a mirrored free

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.970 
arm out I'm going to do a mirrored free
wall<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.820> left<00:00:51.000> arm<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:52.500> right

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
tracing he said we're not going to wait

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
tracing he said we're not going to wait
with<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> today<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.230> want<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> imagine

you've got a little box now this arm is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.139 
you've got a little box now this arm is
going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> start<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> bottom<00:01:02.579> corner<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
going to start at the bottom corner of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.140 
going to start at the bottom corner of
that<00:01:03.270> box<00:01:04.189> your<00:01:05.189> other<00:01:05.309> arms<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.909> push

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that box your other arms going to push

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.590 
that box your other arms going to push
as<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.920> left<00:01:08.159> arm<00:01:08.400> goes<00:01:08.490> backwards<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
as your left arm goes backwards and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
as your left arm goes backwards and
you're<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> push<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.310> remember

you're going to push it up so remember
it's<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.060> acting<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.350> arm<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it's just acting like the right arm is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.450 
it's just acting like the right arm is
controlling<00:01:14.840> very<00:01:15.840> good<00:01:16.170> push<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:19.460> this

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
controlling very good push down now this

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760 
controlling very good push down now this
arm<00:01:20.729> wants<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.390> super<00:01:21.930> solid<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> stay

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
arm wants to say super solid and stay

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.380 
arm wants to say super solid and stay
still<00:01:23.189> who<00:01:23.520> I've<00:01:23.790> been<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> gym

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
still who I've been going to the gym

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
still who I've been going to the gym
anyway<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> uh<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.689> cross<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.159> down

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
anyway and uh and cross and down

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.340 
anyway and uh and cross and down
practice<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> box<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.170> bit

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
practice is just in the box for a bit

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
practice is just in the box for a bit
and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.369> start<00:01:32.549> taking<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> all

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and then you can start taking it all

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
and then you can start taking it all
different<00:01:33.900> directions<00:01:33.930> yeah<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.180> do

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
different directions yeah so you can do

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
different directions yeah so you can do
a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.720> different<00:01:36.840> things<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.500> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a lot of different things with this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460 
a lot of different things with this
technique<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
technique just like this take it in the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.330 
technique just like this take it in the
box<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.670> take<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> diagonal<00:01:42.540> data<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
box you can take a diagonal data so just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.120 
box you can take a diagonal data so just
explore<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:46.259> there's<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.070> more

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
explore all of that now there's one more

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100 
explore all of that now there's one more
telling<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.090> we're<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.570> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
telling one that we're going to do so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.319 
telling one that we're going to do so
this<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.560> combining<00:01:50.220> cutting<00:01:51.090> shapes

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
this is like combining cutting shapes

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.200 
this is like combining cutting shapes
with<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.110> manipulation<00:01:52.920> concept<00:01:53.369> you're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
with the manipulation concept you're

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.100 
with the manipulation concept you're
going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> push<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.649> forms<00:01:55.860> down

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
going to push down as it forms down

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
going to push down as it forms down
push<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.930> drag<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.910> down<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
push out and drag it and down and up and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.770 
push out and drag it and down and up and
up<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.840> down<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:11.240> remember<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.600> are

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
up and down and up remember that the are

that's<00:02:32.670> combining<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.480> tutting<00:02:33.959> shape

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that's combining it with a tutting shape

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.860 
that's combining it with a tutting shape
okay<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.310> we're<00:02:35.430> done<00:02:35.459> playing<00:02:35.820> we've<00:02:36.630> done

okay so we're done playing we've done

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.660 
okay so we're done playing we've done
combining<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.590> tutting<00:02:37.920> shake<00:02:38.160> now

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
combining with the tutting shake now

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.040 
combining with the tutting shake now
we're<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.030> combine<00:02:39.209> with<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> little<00:02:39.930> bit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
we're going to combine with a little bit

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.720 
we're going to combine with a little bit
of<00:02:40.080> waiting<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.739> give<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.070> different<00:02:41.250> twist

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
of waiting but give it a different twist

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.270 
of waiting but give it a different twist
okay<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.320> move<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.130> can

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
