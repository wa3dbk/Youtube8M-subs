roll different volumes different speeds

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:16.760

play<00:02:01.729> some<00:02:01.910> accents

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.840 

you<00:02:17.770> can<00:02:17.920> practice<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> whole<00:02:18.580> bunch<00:02:18.760> of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
you can practice a whole bunch of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.580 
you can practice a whole bunch of
rudiments<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.480> already<00:02:19.660> know<00:02:19.959> go<00:02:20.410> back

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
rudiments that you already know go back

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.400 
rudiments that you already know go back
and<00:02:20.800> try<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.950> play<00:02:21.160> rudiments<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> pillow

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and try to play rudiments on the pillow

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.960 
and try to play rudiments on the pillow
tough<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:23.650> though<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.310> double<00:02:24.670> stroke

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
tough one though is the double stroke

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.780 
tough one though is the double stroke
roll<00:02:25.000> because<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.930> double<00:02:26.290> stroke<00:02:26.530> roll

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
roll because the double stroke roll

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.530 
roll because the double stroke roll
usually<00:02:27.790> requires<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.750> rebound<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:31.360> is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
usually requires a rebound but this is

what we started doing is we eliminate

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.090 
what we started doing is we eliminate
the<00:02:52.900> concept<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.620> talked<00:02:53.950> about

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the concept that we talked about

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.470 
the concept that we talked about
originally<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.940> double<00:02:55.269> stroke<00:02:55.450> roll

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
originally with the double stroke roll

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.840 
originally with the double stroke roll
with<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.930> rebound<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.640> start

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
with the rebound and we have to start

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.509 
with the rebound and we have to start
playing<00:02:58.330> each<00:02:58.660> note<00:02:58.769> right<00:02:59.769> right<00:03:00.070> left<00:03:00.370> left

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
playing each note right right left left

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.759 
playing each note right right left left
right<00:03:00.820> right<00:03:00.970> left<00:03:01.510> left<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.350> can<00:03:02.470> see<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
right right left left so you can see the

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.229 
right right left left so you can see the
lot<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:02.950> my<00:03:03.100> wrist<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.580> getting<00:03:03.880> into<00:03:04.090> this

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
lot of my wrist is getting into this

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.440 
lot of my wrist is getting into this
technique<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:08.610> little<00:03:09.610> bit<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.910> fingers<00:03:10.300> are

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
technique a little bit of fingers are

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.500 
technique a little bit of fingers are
helping<00:03:10.690> me<00:03:10.780> out<00:03:15.150> something<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.329> would

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
helping me out something that I would

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.569 
helping me out something that I would
been<00:03:16.660> I've<00:03:16.870> been<00:03:16.900> practicing<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:18.310> quite<00:03:18.549> a

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
been I've been practicing for quite a

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.210 
been I've been practicing for quite a
long<00:03:18.790> time<00:03:19.030> since<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.450> early<00:03:19.480> 90s<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.890> after

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
long time since the early 90s and after

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.770 
long time since the early 90s and after
I<00:03:21.250> heard<00:03:21.430> Dennis<00:03:21.730> chambers<00:03:22.090> talk<00:03:22.299> about<00:03:22.570> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
I heard Dennis chambers talk about that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.539 
I heard Dennis chambers talk about that
and<00:03:23.079> seeing<00:03:23.290> how<00:03:23.470> fast<00:03:23.709> he<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.040> play<00:03:24.310> I

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
and seeing how fast he can play I

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.580 
and seeing how fast he can play I
thought<00:03:25.239> well<00:03:25.510> hey<00:03:25.630> man<00:03:25.870> if<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.079> works<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.350> him

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
thought well hey man if it works for him

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.729 
thought well hey man if it works for him
I'm<00:03:27.390> definitely<00:03:28.390> going<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.540> try<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.650> you

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
I'm definitely going to try that so you

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.410 
I'm definitely going to try that so you
can<00:03:29.890> do<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.579> can<00:03:30.730> do<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.329> know

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
can do that you can do you know

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.330 
can do that you can do you know
paradiddles<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.380> can<00:03:32.500> try<00:03:32.739> all<00:03:32.890> kinds<00:03:32.920> of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
paradiddles you can try all kinds of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.759 
paradiddles you can try all kinds of
ideas<00:03:33.489> like<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:34.110> finger<00:03:35.110> control<00:03:35.530> is

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
ideas like that finger control is

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.080 
ideas like that finger control is
definitely<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.310> bit<00:03:36.400> harder<00:03:36.700> because<00:03:36.820> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
definitely little bit harder because you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.289 
definitely little bit harder because you
don't<00:03:37.269> have<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.570> rebound<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.079> help<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.350> out

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.819 

but<00:03:46.299> probably<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.690> best<00:03:46.870> thing<00:03:47.170> about<00:03:47.230> pillow

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
but probably the best thing about pillow

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.199 
but probably the best thing about pillow
practice<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.610> you're<00:03:48.790> going<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:48.940> bother

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
practice is that you're going to bother

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.600 
practice is that you're going to bother
no<00:03:49.660> one<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.620> whether<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:50.890> have<00:03:50.950> some<00:03:51.220> parents

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
no one so whether you have some parents

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.430 
no one so whether you have some parents
at<00:03:51.670> home<00:03:51.820> or<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.269> wife<00:03:52.600> or<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.989> husband<00:03:53.410> that

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
at home or a wife or a husband that

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.930 
at home or a wife or a husband that
doesn't<00:03:53.799> want<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.010> listen<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.400> practice

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
doesn't want to listen to you practice

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.910 
doesn't want to listen to you practice
well<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.959> know<00:03:56.079> what<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.440> can<00:03:56.590> sit<00:03:56.769> there<00:03:56.860> and
