like what you could come to here to like

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.540 
like what you could come to here to like
everything<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:36.320> more<00:01:36.560> crisp<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.190> clear

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
everything is just more crisp and clear

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.640
