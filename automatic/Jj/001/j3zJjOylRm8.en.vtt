00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
or someone very close to you for the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
or someone very close to you for the
sake<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.979> greater<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.670> national

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
security I think that the kind of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.370 
security I think that the kind of
terrorism<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.700> faced<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.960> last<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
terrorism that we faced in the last so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.319 
terrorism that we faced in the last so
many<00:01:40.470> years<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.640> many<00:01:41.729> parts<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.210> our

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
many years in so many parts of our

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.649 
many years in so many parts of our
country<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.180> strong

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
country we have to take really strong

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
country we have to take really strong
steps<00:01:46.079> against<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> some<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> those

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
steps against that and some of those

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.170 
steps against that and some of those
strong<00:01:48.210> steps<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.899> mean<00:01:49.939> good<00:01:50.939> might

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
strong steps would mean good might

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.069 
strong steps would mean good might
affect<00:01:51.479> us<00:01:51.710> might<00:01:52.710> affect<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> us<00:01:54.079> for

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
affect us might affect some of us for

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
affect us might affect some of us for
example<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.040> I've<00:01:56.820> always<00:01:57.210> felt

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
example I think that I've always felt

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.200 
example I think that I've always felt
that<00:01:58.070> security<00:01:59.070> agencies<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> police

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that security agencies and the police

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
that security agencies and the police
should<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.840> given<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.320> highest<00:02:01.829> regard<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
should be given the highest regard and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.910 
should be given the highest regard and
the<00:02:03.000> highest<00:02:03.329> respect<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.619> should<00:02:04.799> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the highest respect and they should be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
the highest respect and they should be
allowed<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.219> function<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.210> way<00:02:06.360> they<00:02:06.390> would

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
allowed to function the way they would

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.380 
allowed to function the way they would
