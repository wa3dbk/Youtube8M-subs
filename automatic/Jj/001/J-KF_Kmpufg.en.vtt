you've got plenty of fuel for your trip
before<00:00:48.940> your<00:00:49.120> journey<00:00:49.240> so<00:00:49.630> plan<00:00:49.840> well<00:00:50.020> in

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
before your journey so plan well in

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.020 
before your journey so plan well in
advance<00:00:50.200> for<00:00:50.560> that<00:00:50.730> saleable<00:00:51.730> you<00:00:51.820> want<00:00:51.970> to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
advance for that saleable you want to

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.820 
advance for that saleable you want to
check<00:00:52.570> tablets<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.080> few<00:00:53.290> couple

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
check tablets and a few couple

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.800 
check tablets and a few couple
ways<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.100> can<00:00:54.160> do<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.460> someone<00:00:55.420> screw<00:00:55.690> the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
ways you can do that someone screw the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.410 
ways you can do that someone screw the
cap<00:00:56.020> have<00:00:56.650> a<00:00:56.740> look<00:00:56.860> inside<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.340> tank<00:00:57.610> or<00:00:58.210> of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
cap have a look inside the tank or of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.780 
cap have a look inside the tank or of
course<00:00:58.630> we<00:00:58.720> take<00:00:58.900> a<00:00:58.930> few<00:00:59.200> sample<00:00:59.650> as<00:00:59.890> possible

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.250 

so<00:01:03.790> as<00:01:03.820> we're<00:01:04.089> checking<00:01:04.300> for<00:01:04.480> any<00:01:04.809> leaks<00:01:05.050> or

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
so as we're checking for any leaks or

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.440 
so as we're checking for any leaks or
cracks<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.830> fuel<00:01:06.040> lane<00:01:06.240> check<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.420> a

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
cracks in the fuel lane check that a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.860 
cracks in the fuel lane check that a
breather<00:01:07.810> valve<00:01:08.200> on<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.830> fuel<00:01:09.040> tank<00:01:09.870> opens

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
breather valve on the fuel tank opens

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.680 
breather valve on the fuel tank opens
and<00:01:11.230> closes<00:01:12.120> that'll<00:01:13.120> need<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.360> be<00:01:13.480> in<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
and closes that'll need to be in the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.500 
and closes that'll need to be in the
open<00:01:14.110> position<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.760> engine<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.090> running

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.340 

next<00:01:20.510> we're<00:01:20.600> going<00:01:20.690> to<00:01:20.750> discuss<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.230> oil

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
next we're going to discuss the oil

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.680 
next we're going to discuss the oil
there's<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.220> two-stroke<00:01:22.610> engine<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.300> oil<00:01:23.330> need

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
there's a two-stroke engine the oil need

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.690 
there's a two-stroke engine the oil need
to<00:01:23.780> be<00:01:23.870> mixed<00:01:24.050> into<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.560> tank<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.190> was<00:01:25.640> a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
to be mixed into the tank I was a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.430 
to be mixed into the tank I was a
four-stroke<00:01:26.150> engine<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:26.720> oil<00:01:26.750> was<00:01:27.110> already

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
four-stroke engine the oil was already

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.110 
four-stroke engine the oil was already
and<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.770> engine<00:01:30.250> there's<00:01:31.250> two<00:01:31.430> ratios<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:32.000> us

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
and the engine there's two ratios of us

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.210 
and the engine there's two ratios of us
fifty<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.020> or<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.350> hundred<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.830> one

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
fifty to one or a hundred to one

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.490 
fifty to one or a hundred to one
what's<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.300> two-stroke<00:01:35.660> engine<00:01:35.930> every<00:01:36.320> time

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
what's the two-stroke engine every time

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.680 
what's the two-stroke engine every time
you<00:01:36.680> add<00:01:36.800> fuel<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.369> your<00:01:37.610> tank<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.210> need<00:01:38.630> to

you add fuel to your tank you need to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.060 
you add fuel to your tank you need to
add<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.930> correct<00:01:39.200> ratio<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.369> oil<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.800> check

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
add the correct ratio of oil so check

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.010 
add the correct ratio of oil so check

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
well fall in with you or a VHF radio on

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.540 
well fall in with you or a VHF radio on
board

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.490 

so<00:02:47.550> we're<00:02:47.670> underwater<00:02:47.970> now<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:49.050> startup<00:02:49.350> is

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
so we're underwater now the startup is

so we're underwater now the startup is
for<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.980> engine<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.460> begin<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:52.320> frame<00:02:52.680> up

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
for the engine to begin with we frame up

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.280 
for the engine to begin with we frame up
the<00:02:52.830> fuel<00:02:53.130> system<00:02:53.540> using<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.600> primer<00:02:54.840> bulb<00:02:55.080> in

indication the fuel system is framed

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.990 
indication the fuel system is framed
already<00:03:06.570> go<00:03:06.810> now

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
already go now

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.880 
already go now
so<00:03:09.000> once<00:03:09.180> you've<00:03:09.300> got<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.450> framed<00:03:09.690> up<00:03:09.959> gonna

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
so once you've got it framed up gonna

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.920 
so once you've got it framed up gonna
check<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.640> engine<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.630> the
