00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Have you thought about why we do things for each other? 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.820
 Such as. why we help friends move even though we hate it 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.600
 or why a bee will sacrifice its life by sticking to defend the estate? 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.900
 Why does a vampire bat fly blood into the mouth of another bat 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.000
 who hasn't eaten that day? 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.280
 It's probably a cute bat, I think. It is clumsy in so many ways! 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.000
 It turns out that this is a big issue. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 It has wondered scientists for years, and Darwin believed that atrocious behavior violated the framework 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 his theory of natural selection. If it's all about the best-fit survivor, natural selection would 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.000
 did not pick a feature that reduced our survival chances. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Or could it? 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Darwin studied hives and realized that since sterile workers helped their relatives, especially the queen 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 natural selection could favor altruism within related groups. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 A hundred years later, in 1964, a British scientist named William Hamilton came 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 with an equation that could explain it. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 He thought altruism could be developed as a move if 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Genetic similarity X The benefit of behavior was greater than the cost to the individual. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.500
 Since some behavior types are hereditary, the genes of altruistic behavior, 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 could develop if the benefits are greater than the cost to the individual 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 because it helped family members enough to pay. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Hamilton called this inclusive fitness, thus expanding Darwin's definition of fitness, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 which is just how many children you get so that it now includes family members' offspring. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Hamilton's ideas were a hit among other scientists because it explains things like mine colonies. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Ants do not have a privacy, all they do is for the colony's best. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And worker ants share 75% of their genes and are more closely related to their sisters. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 than they would be with their own offspring. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 According to Hamilton's equation, each ant has a very large genetic interest in the survival of the mycelium. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 But Hamilton's ideas do not explain why some help individuals they are not related to. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Take e.g. us people who are very social and very altruistic - 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.500
 in fact, some researchers believe that our big brains are developed because of the many benefits of selfless behavior - 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 It turns out that sharing and collaboration requires a lot of mental work. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Ask any 3 year old! 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 If you think about it, you can see how we evolved to be altruistic 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 for real selfish reasons - it's hard to help a friend move, 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.500
 But you do it because the friend might one day help you move 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 or that friend might pick you up in the countryside when you are punctured. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It is the same with bats: By spreading some blood to the neighbor, you make sure you come home hungry one day 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Someone will come and pour blood into your mouth. And they will expect the same from you. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Hamilton's equation does not explain this behavior. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 And it complicates things, because the equations are nice if you are a researcher. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 But if you can cooperate with others and resist the temptation to put you on resources, 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Because you know you will be rewarded later, you will behave a lot like ants, bees and vampire bats. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.900
 I get warm and fluffy just at the thought. 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.660
