00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.440 
of crashes especially in the dtft but
for<00:02:11.590> me<00:02:11.680> I'm<00:02:11.860> very<00:02:12.100> happy<00:02:12.460> that<00:02:12.880> water<00:02:13.060> place

of<00:02:17.110> trouble<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.770> think<00:02:18.040> that's<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.400> good

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.940 
of trouble and I think that's a good
thing<00:02:18.690> indeed<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.870> would<00:02:19.990> be<00:02:20.170> s<00:02:20.320> phone<00:02:20.560> cases

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950

from the low countries who would rule
