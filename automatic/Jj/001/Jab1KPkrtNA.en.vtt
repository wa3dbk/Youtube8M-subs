00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.210
 and one of the great advantages of 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.670
 light pavement target is its very low 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.510
 weight approximately three kilos per 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.510
 square meter 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.760
 this allows us an important 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.830
 reduction of structure in new construction and 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.420
 avoid overloads in rehabilitation 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.320
 since there is no need to remove the 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.320
 previous pavement 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.390
 we just need a dry flat screed and 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.190
 hard from a failure if it is 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.349
 new work 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.510
 we can also get it with pasta 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.160
 straighteners applied on the pavement 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.160
 existing in the cases of rehabilitation 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.920
 a simple queue-based gluing 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.960
 unilateral acrylics and a subsequent 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.190
 Roller-based pressure will be 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.190
 enough for installation 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.250
 target developed and applied since 1975 the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.320
 pvr polyurethane protection that gives us 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.660
 a totally finished pavement and 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.579
 ready for use 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.830
 they are also avoided later and 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.720
 applications of waxes and strippers 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.000
 that provides great agility and 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.409
 performance in the facilities with the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.929
 consequently saving time and money 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.549
 its availability in rolls and tiles 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.619
 will allow to always choose the best 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.619
 solution for each type of project 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.079
 the weld seams are 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.240
 designed to match the 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.520
 different pavements 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.610
 They can also be used as elements 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.610
 decorative 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.220
 the meetings can be made to testa or 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.440
 welded hot with the soldier in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 hot unsuccessful previous we will get 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.540
 a physically continuous pavement and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.190
 totally tight extremely option 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.020
 recommended in projects that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.430
 require high levels of hygiene or 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.430
 protection against humidity 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 she 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.689
 Another of the great advantages of 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.450
 targets light movements is its fast 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.920
 adaptation to support what allows us 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.450
 remount sockets and get 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.450
 high protections on walls 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.150
 this is very useful mainly in your 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.970
 application to hygienic bathrooms 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.470
 geriatric changing rooms and health 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.600
 we can fight directly on the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.100
 pavement without having to install dishes 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.910
 of shower or any other barrier 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.910
 architectural 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 and target has developed a complete 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.069
 drainage system to guarantee the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 sealing of the pavement and its easy 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.319
 installation 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.090
 These drains are designed to 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.090
 get a perfect seal 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.650
 we have also developed the system of 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.680
 syphonic collectors to facilitate 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.720
 cleaning and avoid bad smells this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.970
 installation will be fully flush 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.190
 with the pavement itself facilitating the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.190
 total interior mobility inside the bathroom 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.740
 on the other hand the great possibilities 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.870
 of adaptation allow us to solve 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.440
 deliveries and outgoing pipes or 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.440
 Drains from the toilets 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.440
 ah 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.069
 ah 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.959
 the possibility of heating the pavement 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.590
 It also allows us to adapt to 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.590
 any situation 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.090
 This basement comeback is done with the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.769
 own pavement avoiding sharp edges 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.239
 that can accumulate dirt and 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.960
 guaranteeing at the same time 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.600
 tightness 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.120
 this comeback is maintained even in the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.120
 vertical view welding at 45 degrees 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.460
 such 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.940
 ah 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.590
 All joints are hot welded 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.629
 we could get to fill all the 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.229
 water room without having any type 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.229
 of flight 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.680
 the damage system is target combines with 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.720
 a wide range of coatings 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.970
 murals to cover the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.400
 walls without visible corners and 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.530
 obtain facilities at all times 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.850
 totally integral and 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.850
 absolutely hygienic
