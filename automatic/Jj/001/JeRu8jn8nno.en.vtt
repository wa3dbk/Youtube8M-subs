00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:10.200
 the trip I do not know about you but me every time 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.410
 who sees me traveling often pay a lot 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.480
 more than I really need to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.640
 better we go to a special dinner and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 touch bring this to the best there is I do not know 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.270
 that maybe I do not know what I'm going to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.810
 need this is really in my mind 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.720
 I think I'm going to need it then what 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.619
 packed so normally usually always or 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 always tend to pay more because as 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.250
 you know a lot of matÃ­as of every day 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.560
 so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.210
 I do not know why I do it but even though I know that 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.010
 I do it always ends up doing it because 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.110
 I get the feeling that I'm going to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 need and I will not have it and it's that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 suddenly because now I've taken it 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 so it will happen to prevent you from healing like this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 that I will teach all the video in this 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 it will be a trip and this is very well being of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.120
 makeup I know it 's giant 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 and I have to be bad because I was 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.520
 subtracting the hair with the iron and the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.360
 I put here and law got up in the skin 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.060
 so this is necessary makeup 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.520
 and point 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.689
 that's all that took me to spain 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.689
 now what would we do and then first thing 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.920
 both from there and I'm already taking 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.290
 supposed jolines lavalette plan e that 12 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 I'm super sad because 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.690
 I do not know if it happened to you too 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.790
 some that you have the line 2 that you 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.250
 use in the shadows and I do not use this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.500
 it scores a lot but I have fallen three 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 times and all three times the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.380
 urns from outside because they are not 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.570
 stuck and they love us and I think the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.720
 I'm going to have to take them all out and get them back 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.250
 to hit the base because it's that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.160
 have broken for example this is super 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.710
 broken in the middle this corner is 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.200
 horrible because that's why it's not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 also that you do to the base and they have 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.130
 come out and well I love the colors 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.170
 so do not wear strips and fingers 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.590
 because in my mind to have a chance 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.509
 special and once you need so I 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.430
 they will take that from one also because I 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.320
 love this color for the eyebrows and it is 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.550
 which he normally uses when we 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.520
 says a pencil and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.260
 and the colors that I have to do the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.800
 make someone or if I feel like doing 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.090
 the bad day that someone has the palette 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.920
 I'm also thinking that something 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.610
 let's do with my sisters with my 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.630
 sister a video where you answer 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.880
 or some makeup video or enough 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.920
 to be able to do something like that, it's worth 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.950
 next that I carry is obviously my 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.750
 sunscreen and after this that is 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.349
 a flame is not there to keep the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.220
 brushes and he got there then brushes that 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.180
 I need and some others as perhaps for 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.189
 what 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.330
 just in case so I all the 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.940
 brushes there 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.890
 after he arrived is really the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.320
 good clean makeup I wear something else 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.140
 but very bad makeup and 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.770
 makeup led 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.540
 a single foundation of makeup that is the 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.810
 rule with this which is my favorite of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.700
 always and bicolors 250 from space and me 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.050
 love it so of course champion 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.300
 is talking well putting things 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.310
 then I wear my colorful lipstick 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.680
 I love it every once in a while in summer 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.540
 with occasions they study carry you know 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.970
 painted a color then came the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.160
 purple in pink barbie this is very 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.690
 strong clarito but strong and orange 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.380
 so one of each color came and it led 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.380
 the red just in case 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.269
 I wear translucent powders just in case 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.280
 the powder is from which they are good 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.680
 here that is a bronzer prize I use 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.530
 of illuminator because it is very clear to me 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.299
 love after die corrector the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.069
 sonia home corrector and also the 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.750
 corrector of 9 and a track I do not like 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.790
 once in a while he used the transforms 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.030
 because I do not like it, it's enough 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.030
 so I take both of them by themselves 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.810
 of colors it took me two was my favorite 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.810
 it is with everyone 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:35.519
 it is not and it is that which is orange variable 

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:37.259
 orange is coral with glitters a little bit 

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.659
 golden but also has a little 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.669
 I do not know pink is very beautiful 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.459
 love and it is clear to me that someone with 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.729
 brown skins and then I show this 

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:50.219
 which is a little pink in bordeaux 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.649
 clearly that looks great so a 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.529
 orange and no point is just in case and 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:56.969
 then obviously I wear tan 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.409
 me after your everything comes from what 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.939
 that the product without cream is already at home 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.369
 the trailer and dark because as I said 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.529
 before you believe in some video I'm leaving 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:06.179
 that but no makeup I'm 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.189
 using the caribe for the whole face 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:09.779
 to comment a bit on the face and 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.299
 then the dark to put on the 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:14.569
 computer in specific areas and this 

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:18.469
 because he is a referral of always and 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.469
 I will surely need it 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.279
 today 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.740
 for this he brought me the two masks 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.960
 eyelashes the normal and the warner bros 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.740
 just in case the normal for all 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.969
 days if it is in case I need it or if I 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.300
 I want to put in the pool with the 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.300
 Beach 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.540
 and then he took to see a lipstick 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.450
 color of sight that I take now that his 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.950
 lipstick very similar to my ships by 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.270
 if for every day a color 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.010
 eyeliner although usually the 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.840
 I took it from line, if it touched me 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.650
 but on some special occasion or a 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.810
 consists of eye line 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.210
 and then I have this one that is of volumes 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.370
 modern and the net de l'orel which is the 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.720
 of for the water line and then a 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.520
 shadow is that which is the one that 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.530
 just use today enamored is of 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.300
 bordeaux mary kate will see a woman 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.030
 who works a mine that works in 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.180
 medicaid and medium this shadow and spices 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.550
 hasburg precious and curious companies and 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.560
 notorious but he has used me today and 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.420
 I loved concretion of everything I think 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.610
 that stands out with the green eyes 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.000
 so I love it, I take it because 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.010
 I will surely need it after this 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.450
 that is for my lips of l'orÃ©al no 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:43.240
 of revealing a wine is not a color of the 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.009
 Silver time and sometimes a red rouge 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.540
 so 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.350
 a Vaseline 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:56.360
 and up 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:58.120
 and of course and fifths and limitations 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.370
 it has taken me 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.410
 the abbot and former president of the product 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.530
 animal of course because they come from me 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.880
 walk and I want to put it in that 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.360
 It will take same place before the same 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.699
 we put a rose and then the white 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.790
 because I want to repaint the 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:18.760
 white nails my letter and a top coat 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:22.510
 so that the nail polish lasts for me so 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:25.870
 he took his 3 and this and that's all 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.280
 that I take away I know that maybe it seems 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.990
 which is too much or even shows 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.880
 surely maybe you will take more 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.639
 but for me this is very much the 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.379
 makeup 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.370
 certainly you do not have to over 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:40.860
 half but I prefer to take more to have 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.120
 it is not necessary so I hope that I have 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.219
 liked the video and tell me the 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.439
 comments you also always put them 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:48.270
 for more quantity than what you need 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:50.789
 I leave you all my social ills in the 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.560
 information box and do not forget 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:53.909
 panel the draw of the subscribe video 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.090
 or if we are in the next up 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:56.090
 then
