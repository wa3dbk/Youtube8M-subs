00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
little lovely gun accessory is that it

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.910 
little lovely gun accessory is that it
looks<00:00:12.389> like<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> PlayStation<00:00:12.840> moves<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
looks like the PlayStation moves in it

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.140 
looks like the PlayStation moves in it
because<00:00:14.099> that's<00:00:14.219> basically<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:14.969> uses

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
because that's basically what it uses

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.230 
because that's basically what it uses
this<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> Kinect<00:00:16.080> game<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.300> basically<00:00:20.240> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
this is a Kinect game and basically it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.359 
this is a Kinect game and basically it
basically<00:00:21.689> uses<00:00:21.960> these<00:00:22.289> three<00:00:22.680> orbs<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
basically uses these three orbs to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
basically uses these three orbs to
triangulate<00:00:23.789> its<00:00:24.150> position<00:00:24.210> through<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
triangulate its position through a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
triangulate its position through a
ridiculous<00:00:26.070> calibration<00:00:26.730> process<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.330> nice

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
ridiculous calibration process one nice

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
ridiculous calibration process one nice
thing<00:00:27.510> about<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.050> gun<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.980> course<00:00:29.130> I'm

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
thing about the gun and of course I'm

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.780 
thing about the gun and of course I'm
blocking<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> light<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> actually<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
blocking the light is it actually has a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
blocking the light is it actually has a
scope<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:34.079> doesn't<00:00:34.350> really<00:00:34.500> sense

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
scope and it doesn't really sense

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
scope and it doesn't really sense
anything<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.370> neat<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.579> lean<00:00:35.910> down

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
anything but it's just neat to lean down

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.119 
anything but it's just neat to lean down
aim<00:00:36.450> down<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> sights<00:00:36.800> works<00:00:37.800> pretty<00:00:37.980> well

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
aim down the sights works pretty well

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.299 
aim down the sights works pretty well
once<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.520> calibrate<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.860> is<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
once you calibrate it which is more of a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
once you calibrate it which is more of a
task<00:00:41.579> than<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> should<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.230> to

task than it should be so I'm going to
try<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> calibrate<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.280> bad<00:00:44.489> boy<00:00:45.920> we're<00:00:46.920> also

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
me how you got calibrated basically you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.350 
me how you got calibrated basically you
got<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> walk<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> bird<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.640> can't<00:01:30.150> just

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
got a walk with the bird you can't just

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
got a walk with the bird you can't just
you<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:30.930> tilt<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> gun<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.950> any<00:01:32.430> human

no tilting up and down and just line
with<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> gun<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> bird<00:01:39.320> why<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.380> has

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
with the gun with the bird why this has
