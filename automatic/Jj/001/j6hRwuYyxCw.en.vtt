00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the most doubles triples homeruns

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
the most doubles triples homeruns
whatever<00:01:33.450> some<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> older<00:01:34.619> bats<00:01:34.829> like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
whatever some of the older bats like

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.270 
whatever some of the older bats like
Ripken's<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> nerfs<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> screwball<00:01:38.070> bats

Ripken's and nerfs and screwball bats
they<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.000> kind<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> flat<00:01:39.630> side<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> them

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they all get kind of a flat side to them

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.300 
they all get kind of a flat side to them
so<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.439> want<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.799> flat<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.280> facing

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so you want that flat side facing

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
so you want that flat side facing
forward<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.540> makes<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.899> bigger<00:01:43.079> sweet<00:01:43.470> spot

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
forward that makes a bigger sweet spot

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
forward that makes a bigger sweet spot
but<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.579> use<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> moon<00:01:45.060> shot<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:45.630> just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
but if you use a moon shot that has just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
but if you use a moon shot that has just
a<00:01:45.990> generally<00:01:46.439> large<00:01:46.710> sweet<00:01:47.070> spot<00:01:47.340> hits<00:01:47.790> well

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
a generally large sweet spot hits well
