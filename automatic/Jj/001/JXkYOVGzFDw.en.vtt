on<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.100> MIT<00:02:36.460> on<00:02:36.610> card

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
on to MIT on card

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.540 
on to MIT on card
so<00:02:37.630> these<00:02:37.840> three<00:02:38.320> right<00:02:38.620> here<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> only

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
so these three right here are the only

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.690 
so these three right here are the only
ones<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.530> loose<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.370> don't<00:02:42.550> have

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
ones I have just like loose I don't have

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.650 
ones I have just like loose I don't have
them<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> wall

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
them on a wall

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.210 
them on a wall
because<00:02:44.110> most<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.500> them<00:02:44.680> are<00:02:44.770> on<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.920> wall

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
because most of them are on the wall

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.830 
because most of them are on the wall
right<00:02:45.460> now<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:45.940> these<00:02:46.360> are<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> only<00:02:46.690> ones
