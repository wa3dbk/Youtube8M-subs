00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
completely hypothetical question and I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
completely hypothetical question and I
haven't<00:01:58.350> even<00:01:58.500> talked<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.710> anybody<00:01:58.979> about<00:01:59.340> it

except I thought it'd be a good idea to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.330 
except I thought it'd be a good idea to
you<00:02:00.929> know<00:02:01.020> maybe<00:02:01.200> address<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.799> today<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.189> talk

about it used to get your guys opinions
what<00:02:04.289> would<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.979> carnage<00:02:05.399> were<00:02:05.609> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
what would you think if carnage were to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.590 
what would you think if carnage were to
come<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.119> their<00:02:06.240> own<00:02:06.390> merchandise

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
come out with their own merchandise

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.320 
come out with their own merchandise
would<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.289> guys<00:02:07.469> possibly<00:02:08.190> wear<00:02:08.759> personally

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
would you guys possibly wear personally

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.029 
would you guys possibly wear personally
I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.690> carnage<00:02:10.020> logo<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.440> pretty<00:02:10.740> sick

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
I think the carnage logo is pretty sick

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.800 
I think the carnage logo is pretty sick
and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> could<00:02:11.400> definitely<00:02:11.760> rock<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.180> uh<00:02:12.360> like

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and I could definitely rock like uh like

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.660 
and I could definitely rock like uh like
a<00:02:12.930> big<00:02:13.110> carnage<00:02:13.620> crewneck<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.460> wearing

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
a big carnage crewneck like I'm wearing

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.250 
a big carnage crewneck like I'm wearing
now<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.240> big<00:02:15.420> K<00:02:15.690> right<00:02:15.900> across<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
now with the big K right across the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.150 
now with the big K right across the
middle<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> think<00:02:16.500> that'd<00:02:16.740> be<00:02:16.830> pretty<00:02:16.950> awesome

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
middle I think that'd be pretty awesome

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.070 
middle I think that'd be pretty awesome
the<00:02:17.430> colors<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:17.910> great<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
the colors are great and you know the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.360 
the colors are great and you know the
logo<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.440> pretty<00:02:19.680> sick<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.099> think<00:02:20.190> that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
logo is pretty sick so I think that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.790 
logo is pretty sick so I think that
would<00:02:20.459> go<00:02:20.670> well<00:02:20.909> but<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:22.170> know<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.709> not

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
would go well but you know I'm just not

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.040 
would go well but you know I'm just not
sure<00:02:22.920> obviously

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
sure obviously

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.920 
sure obviously
I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.680> it's<00:02:25.580> tougher<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.150> clans<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.780> make

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
I think it's tougher for clans to make

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.240 
I think it's tougher for clans to make
merchandise<00:02:27.170> simply<00:02:27.770> because<00:02:28.040> they're<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
merchandise simply because they're a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.040 
merchandise simply because they're a
clan<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.820> like<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.240> person<00:02:29.600> is<00:02:29.690> wearing<00:02:29.990> it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
clan it's like the person is wearing it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.260 
clan it's like the person is wearing it
kind<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.320> wants<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> represent<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.670> know<00:02:31.790> the

kind of wants to represent you know the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.760 
kind of wants to represent you know the
single<00:02:32.510> person<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.080> they<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.350> rather<00:02:33.590> than

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
single person that they like rather than

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.350 
single person that they like rather than

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
carnage and everything it would be a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.480 
carnage and everything it would be a
really<00:03:12.530> awesome<00:03:12.710> thing<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.220> no<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.400> have
