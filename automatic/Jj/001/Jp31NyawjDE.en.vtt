angle I would approximate this angle at
a<00:03:14.470> pad<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.640> little<00:03:16.480> more<00:03:16.600> than<00:03:16.720> 45<00:03:17.080> degrees

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
a pad a little more than 45 degrees

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.680 
a pad a little more than 45 degrees
right<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.800> mean<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.489> like<00:03:18.580> maybe<00:03:19.209> 50

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
right I mean this is like maybe 50

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.900 
right I mean this is like maybe 50
degree<00:03:22.080> angle<00:03:23.080> for<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.380> clock<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.830> then<00:03:24.430> yeah

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
degree angle for the clock and then yeah

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.900 
degree angle for the clock and then yeah
it's<00:03:25.090> all<00:03:25.239> about<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.750> big<00:03:26.080> window<00:03:26.500> in<00:03:26.910> the
