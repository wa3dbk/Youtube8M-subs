what I think so there's six canisters
shoot<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> six<00:00:54.840> canisters<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.530> blow<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.860> up

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
shoot the six canisters or blow them up

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
shoot the six canisters or blow them up
