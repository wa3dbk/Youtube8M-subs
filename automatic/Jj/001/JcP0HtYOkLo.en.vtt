00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.200
 from 95 2 0 probably one of the most beautiful compact cameras on the market is a thin profile 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.240
 aluminum case in front of the big screen behind the flagship looks like compacts with a series of 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.720
 nikon is very cool and what is hidden inside this dude 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.940
 here, too, there is something to tell the main trump cards with 95 2 0 powerful lens and 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.119
 convenient control well and as a bonus here installed Wi-Fi 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.369
 and let's start the DPS module in order here we have a lens with 22 multiple 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.600
 Optical approximation is a lot of focal length 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.909
 distance is 25,550 millimeters to see this range 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.879
 on these pictures and 550 millimeters is not 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.809
 marketing ploy and quite working focal length here are a few 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.059
 pictures for example the overall impression of the photos are not bad for a compact 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.319
 camera with 95 2 0 removes well moderate sharpness and saturation 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:02.229
 there will be more than enough photos given out by this to the facts now 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.979
 let's get to the management here everything is really convenient camera 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.950
 big enough to hold a pleasant index finger 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.149
 he lays down on the shutter button and zoom lever thumb 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.969
 intuitively pulls up to disk picking mode and 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.289
 and itâ€™s already convenient to control the rest of the camera buttons from the minuses 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.670
 About small elevators buttons Kate work and nothing 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.479
 As for the shooting process itself, the camera turns on and takes pictures quickly 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.780
 Zoom as it seemed to us a little slows down, although if you think about 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.710
 focal lengths of the camera, this is not surprisingly pleasant sensation from 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.369
 work is enhanced by a very fast autofocus, see for yourself how it is 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.950
 works at different focal lengths and in different conditions 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.920
 In the mode of high-speed shooting from 95 2 0, there can also surprise several modes here 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.940
 the works are the most useful. 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.230
 an instant series of 5 shots in the second one can take up to 40 frames in a row from 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.470
 two frames per second what else is interesting here 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.070
 testing and with it seemed that raising the value above 800 units is not 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.420
 costs further the cameras begin to destroy the detail of the image with all dimensional steps 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.500
 It is in principle a common thing for any compacts to display the camera enough 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 quality diagonal to all with half centimeters and a resolution of 614 thousand 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.660
 There are enough points for normal work with the camera, as we have already noted at the beginning of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.090
 nikon 95 2 0 there are wi-fi and gps modules with their help the camera can be connected 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 smartphone and control it from it and of course send photos to your phone 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.410
 and post them on the Internet gps-module is not only to 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.330
 write geo tags to photos but also for easy orientation 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.360
 Turn on the compass in the settings and it starts to appear at the bottom 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.350
 the camera screen is true both modules are cool sits the battery so turn them on 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.400
 only by the need of the battery itself is enough for about 250 300 shots 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.440
 let's go to the mode of shooting video as it should be a modern camera 95 2 0 can 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.700
 shoot full hd format with a frequency of 30 frames the house and autofocus work during 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.670
 shooting true built-in microphone captures noises from working 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.330
 zoom lens 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.410
 The quality of the video itself is quite decent as for a compact standard camera. 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.340
 shooting modes here are a lot of the main are selected using the selector dial a 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.590
 extra through the menu by the way about the menu it is with 95 2 0 like all new cameras 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.930
 Nikon is very simple and clear the first point 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.630
 these are shooting mode settings 2 video settings 3 gps settings and Wi-Fi 4 common 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.840
 camera settings with 95 2 0 strong camera for every day a good set of modes 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.440
 Shooting a cool lens with a huge focal length and simple 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.610
 controlling such a home camera kit is more than enough
