00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
she had to lathe well a three-layer

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.849 
she had to lathe well a three-layer
two-piece<00:00:11.610> case<00:00:14.179> so<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.289> little<00:00:16.289> port<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:16.740> so

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
two-piece case so a little port up so

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.760 
two-piece case so a little port up so
you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.070> easily<00:00:17.190> easily<00:00:18.000> separate<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
you can easily easily separate it this

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
you can easily easily separate it this
is<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> front<00:00:20.250> part<00:00:20.430> houses<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> built-in

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
is the front part houses the built-in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.750 
is the front part houses the built-in
screen<00:00:21.660> protector<00:00:22.039> she's<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.279> gap<00:00:23.609> at

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
screen protector she's got that gap at

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.420 
screen protector she's got that gap at
the<00:00:23.789> top<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:24.960> hear<00:00:25.650> your<00:00:25.800> course<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the top so you can hear your course the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.089 
the top so you can hear your course the
home<00:00:27.060> buttons<00:00:27.390> protected<00:00:27.869> by<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
home buttons protected by that so the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040 
home buttons protected by that so the
idea<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.910> click<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.539> part<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:30.929> your

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
idea is you click this part on your

button side first I'm probably the best

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.069 
button side first I'm probably the best
idea<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.300> love<00:00:36.540> me<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> once<00:00:39.540> that's<00:00:39.660> securely

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.630 
mind when you're picking the color of
this<00:00:49.020> case<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.039> five<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.489> six

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
this case I do do it about five or six

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.069 
this case I do do it about five or six
different<00:00:50.760> colors<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.809> find

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
different colors so sure you can find

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
different colors so sure you can find
something<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
something that you like and then this is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
something that you like and then this is
your<00:00:54.030> back<00:00:54.239> part<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
your back part here it's actually a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
your back part here it's actually a
military<00:00:55.920> spec<00:00:56.610> US<00:00:57.360> military<00:00:57.780> spec<00:00:58.050> approved

military spec US military spec approved

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
military spec US military spec approved
case<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.940> assured<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.329> getting

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
case so you can be assured you getting

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.720 
case so you can be assured you getting
good<00:01:00.719> protection<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.430> dust

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
good protection or so it's it's dust

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.660 
good protection or so it's it's dust
proof<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.650> Windham<00:01:04.650> were<00:01:04.799> crying<00:01:05.159> proof<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
proof and Windham were crying proof and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
proof and Windham were crying proof and
so<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.810> quite<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.049> lot<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> extra

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so on you do get quite a lot of extra

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
so on you do get quite a lot of extra
grit<00:01:08.040> from<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> edge<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> case<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.780> I'll

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
grit from the edge of the case so I'll

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
grit from the edge of the case so I'll
do<00:01:10.049> I'll<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.200> pop<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.909> little

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
do I'll just pop this in can be a little

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.640 
do I'll just pop this in can be a little
bit<00:01:12.360> awkward<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.020> sometimes<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.560> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
bit awkward to get in sometimes but this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.960 
bit awkward to get in sometimes but this
looks<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.549> nicely<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
looks like it's going in nicely so if we

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
looks like it's going in nicely so if we
just<00:01:18.119> start<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.630> there's<00:01:19.200> you've<00:01:19.500> got

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
just start here there's you've got

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
just start here there's you've got
access<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.100> usana<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> switch<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> can

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
access to usana and switch so you can

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.060 
access to usana and switch so you can
get<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> back<00:01:22.560> through<00:01:22.830> there

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
get to that just to back through there

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
get to that just to back through there
your<00:01:23.850> volume<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.930> press<00:01:25.229> through

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
your volume up and down a press through

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
your volume up and down a press through
that<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.799> feels<00:01:26.040> absolutely<00:01:26.220> fine<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.880> press

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that that feels absolutely fine to press

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.960 
that that feels absolutely fine to press
at<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> bottom<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.979> reports<00:01:29.820> are

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
at the bottom all your reports are

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.840 
at the bottom all your reports are
covered<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.619> obviously<00:01:31.619> keeps<00:01:32.189> dust<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
covered so obviously keeps dust and so

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.310 
covered so obviously keeps dust and so
on<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.420> access<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> lightning

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
on out you can access the lightning

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.999 
on out you can access the lightning
through<00:01:34.470> there

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
through there

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
through there
the<00:01:35.490> three<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> half<00:01:35.970> mil<00:01:36.270> jump<00:01:36.540> through

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the three and a half mil jump through

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
the three and a half mil jump through
there<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.170> you've<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.770> cutouts<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.430> the
