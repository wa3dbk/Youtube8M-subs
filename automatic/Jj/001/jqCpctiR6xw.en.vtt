 &gt;&gt; RENÃ‰ WILDHABER: The Megavalanche is quite a unique event in the French Alps. 

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:23.770
 The Alpe d'Huez is a famous mountain for cyclists and also for mountain bikers. 

00:00:27.174 --> 00:00:28.294
 There is a good atmosphere. 

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:32.012
 We cook together, chill with friends. 

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:38.312
 We invite some friends from Livigno, or Ross from the US. 

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.562
 It's cool, there's a mountain bike atmosphere. 

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:44.658
 Different nationalities, all the same spirit. That is cool. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.699
 During the Megavalanche, we start at the top of the summit. 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.889
 It is 3,330 meters high. 

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:57.821
 A little ice and snow on the top, 

00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:05.999
 and then very high speeds on grass and dusty meadows, 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:12.389
 then we enter the forest and then the single track in the forest follows 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:15.578
 and then very hard down to Ulmo. 

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:20.558
 This race is 27 kilometers long over 700 meters. 

00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:22.666
 On the one hand there is a lot of pressure, 

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:29.329
 because I have won it 6 times and I became second twice. 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.074
 There is always that pressure to win and my will to win, 

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:37.392
 but on the other hand it is also just such a beautiful course 

00:01:37.392 --> 00:01:45.042
 and a long track and I really enjoy driving there and giving it everything. 

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:52.241
 I enjoy nature and the early start on this mountain. 

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.254
 Really, up there on that mountain, 

00:01:54.254 --> 00:01:55.995
 It has something special to do 

00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:59.126
 to ride down with a group of fast riders. 

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:02.818
 800 riders at the same time, that's cool. 

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:06.237
 The start is pretty difficult, 

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:10.408
 so many riders go up early. 

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:16.540
 For me it's the most important thing to do 

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:21.312
 to invert the other and to remain calm. 

00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:23.729
 Even when I'm not in the lead, 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.140
 because the race is so long, 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.783
 there is still enough opportunity to come forward 

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:34.708
 and stay calm and enjoy it. 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.766
 I did the Scratch during the qualifying round 

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:41.871
 because he was shorter and more downhill. 

00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:46.906
 It was very cool and he had good suspension 

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:50.210
 and was very stable in the fast parts. 

00:02:52.678 --> 00:02:56.257
 The maintenance and adjustment of the bicycle is very important here 

00:02:56.797 --> 00:03:01.130
 because the bike must be perfect in my opinion 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.346
 because it is a long downhill and if something is not right 

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:09.341
 it is a long walk down. 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.451
 So the bike must be perfect. 

00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:16.485
 Normally I do my own maintenance, 

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.400
 but here i get some help so i feel better 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.093
 can concentrate on the competition. 

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:02.468
 I am satisfied. Third place. 

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:06.028
 I think it's important to be on stage. 

00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:07.727
 Yes, I am very happy. 

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.822
 Anything can happen during this competition. 

00:04:09.822 --> 00:04:13.170
 And I'm always happy again when I finish 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.332
 have met without technical problems. 

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:19.140
 I have driven a good race, and it is perfect. 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.244
 I want to thank the engineers, 

00:04:25.075 --> 00:04:27.749
 they help me a lot and also my girlfriend Katja. 

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:31.347
 She supports me all year round, 

00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:36.978
 and I hope everyone comes down safely and without accidents. 

00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:39.288
 That is the Alpe d'Huez. 

00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:43.920
 It is a kind of fight, but a fair fight. 

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:48.586
 Yes, 2012 is just a year away from us.
