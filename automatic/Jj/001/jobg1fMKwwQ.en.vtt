00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 don't all grow old and hold your nose to the wind with 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.080
 you count and today we talk about 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.509
 something serious will not smear 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.730
 snot on the adjacent territory immediately where 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.800
 any mod pack water produced 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.350
 Virgins usually bring new chips into the game 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 makes the gameplay more comfortable beautiful and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.699
 so on, the developers are not far behind and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.609
 screw up new graphics for 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.650
 more entertainment but what if 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 a dozen years to your computer 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 or you were sent on a business trip under 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 hand a little laptop maybe you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.530
 stationed all summer in the village to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
 adored by grandparents saying that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 computer they have but to check it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.579
 turned out to be in the face with moss 4 pinchuk tanks 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.690
 I want to play but it seems that the whole world 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.570
 covered the shroud 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 and all against your crook in fact 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.550
 there is a way out and it is under the data 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.440
 video in the video description of the series which you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 see this is not a port of tanks but from the address 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.829
 or segu and quite a playable 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 a file to a client driven 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.210
 Game States 2003 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.799
 so if you want to play tanks on 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 very weak computer 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.900
 minimum will need process 1800 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 megahertz is better than dual core but one core 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 more or less loss one gigabyte 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.220
 video memory and radeon video card 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.740
 x700 pro or g force 5 600 w 128 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.479
 megabytes of memory on board 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 and integrated graphics intel and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 840 if the video card has less 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.090
 memory capacity which is especially important for 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.040
 embedded video cards 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 better get one and a half gigabytes 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.200
 RAM for windows xp or 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670
 two gigabytes for seven 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.189
 coprocessor think about karma and video to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 this assembly which is 1 of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.640
 visible changes can be noticed 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.229
 simplifying the effects of shots blasts 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.159
 movements and other graphic 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.590
 buns 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.720
 textures of tanks map is compressed practically 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.840
 a thousand times may not look very 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 beautiful but work 20 30 fps with 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.460
 the previously mentioned system survive quite 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.799
 can also be changed 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.010
 interface hangar texture resolution and 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.930
 mini map effects lighting smoothing 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.390
 and other delights of a civilized game 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.940
 subjected to brutal persecution and brought 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.100
 in sacrifice to the gods of the performance of the shadow 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.459
 as it is but they are nailed to the ground 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.690
 Installation vut while just to disgrace 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.760
 run the installer and unpack 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 either in the folder with the tanks or in any 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.470
 another convenient place agree with 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.470
 restarting the computer is very important 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.940
 serious this is important the graph file is copied to 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.010
 the root directory of the game and the contents 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.080
 texture archive at world of tanks 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.989
 g times while replacing repetitive 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.260
 files important that the installation is necessary 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.970
 produce on a clean client 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.400
 Next, run auto install.bat 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.540
 as administrator it is necessary 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.760
 in order for the installer 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.519
 edit the driver file without unnecessary 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.920
 curses side systems are waiting 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.320
 disappearances annoyed and enjoy the game 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.660
 inside the game you can change the resolution and 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.489
 3d render quality remaining settings 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.040
 better not to touch otherwise have 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.930
 reinstall the client also not 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.750
 forget to install the latest drivers for 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.630
 your video card and turn off all unnecessary 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.030
 sky browser mail agent app and client on 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.790
 windows 7 makes sense begovic &amp; expo and 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.470
