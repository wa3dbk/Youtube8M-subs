00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.950
 Well, we have already made a bit of progress and 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.950
 and look here we have 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.959
 the wood that will hold the monitor to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.959
 this used monitor monitor 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.960
 and here we have the plastic piece with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.769
 one strip the expected 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.630
 that this piece is going to make a diffuser 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.910
 hate the reflector 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.270
 to illuminate the marquee the piece 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.140
 then mind 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.460
 It's curved and it acts as a reflector for 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.579
 that light 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.480
 gene was called inside the marquee 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.519
 well and here we can see how we have 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.000
 distributed the computer within the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.750
 of the furniture 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.750
 aside 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.640
 the plate 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.980
 we already have the sound connected 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.700
 and the source feed to the source 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.750
 we have taken out food 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.250
 the cable that will then feed the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.220
 monitor well just with connect the light 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.200
 to the source the source goes to the monitor and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.270
 and the light of the marquee is going to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.740
 feed him 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.570
 eloquent to both the computer 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.180
 so with a single connector here 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.350
 behind we have everything fed inside 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.350
 of the machine 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.760
 place the times if we remember 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.760
 in this way there is a slot 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.040
 and then just give a deal 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.870
 and to place the to hold it by 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.300
 under 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.760
 you need a piece like this is a 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.159
 wood with another slot and has some 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.439
 squads 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.509
 behind that are the ones that are going to 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.300
 allow to release it but behind 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.520
 piece is going to go behind we'll see 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.550
 we are placing you have to notice that I 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.450
 calm and if they have to touch 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.450
 completely the panel 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.390
 together 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.060
 obviously for that the panel has to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.620
 be held by your screws and in your 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.680
 original position to be able to leverage 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 the bc on the panel and so be 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.180
 completely fair 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.010
 here you can see how it has been with the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.010
 front part 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.000
 but the most important thing is 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.000
 how it is placed from behind 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.160
 you know this wood 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.760
 it has a slot on the animal where 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.370
 It's quiet you and the se-40 held with the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.370
 branch above 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.370
 as it is much here is subject latu
