00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
you want me and yes but just walk into

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.860

place<00:02:31.730> I've<00:02:32.730> actually<00:02:33.000> I've<00:02:33.299> done<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.660> where

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
place I've actually I've done it's where

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.289 
place I've actually I've done it's where
I've<00:02:33.959> duplicated<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:37.040> six<00:02:38.040> people<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:39.150> all

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
I've duplicated like six people but all

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.120 
I've duplicated like six people but all
facing<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.780> same<00:02:39.870> direction<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.709> look<00:02:40.920> great

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
facing the same direction so look great

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.569 
facing the same direction so look great
but<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.310> think<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:41.700> should<00:02:41.849> work<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:42.410> facing

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
but I think this should work with facing

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.800 
but I think this should work with facing
the<00:02:44.579> sinking<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.060> how<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.299> could<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.720> at

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
the sinking of how we could do that at

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.390 
the sinking of how we could do that at
the<00:02:45.900> same<00:02:46.079> time<00:02:46.349> by<00:02:46.530> something<00:02:46.799> i<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.310> we

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the same time by something i can so we

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.220 
the same time by something i can so we
might<00:02:47.579> ask<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.090> do<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:48.299> again<00:02:53.930> his<00:02:54.930> wife

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
might ask you to do this again his wife

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.949 
might ask you to do this again his wife
actually<00:02:55.620> bring<00:02:56.069> my<00:02:56.819> one<00:02:57.390> guess<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
actually bring my one guess and I

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:08.289 
actually bring my one guess and I
screwed<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.410> up<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:03.120> distance<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:04.019> sure
