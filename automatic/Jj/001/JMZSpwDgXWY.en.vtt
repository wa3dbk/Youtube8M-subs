00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 well it's everybody 79 and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.890
 today we will meet for a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.179
 tip pp so what are we going 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.570
 learn to do we will take a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.679
 attacked a base so a mass pollock 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 support flawless 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.060
 so we can see that no fault 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.060
 in this database except one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 finally the fault elite is below here 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.480
 so yes in this sense to recruit I 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 could not that those blocks like that so 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.400
 we imagine that I can not break the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 block nor anything there I tell myself how I 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.390
 going inside is pretty simple 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.790
 you do like that and here you are 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 inside the college 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.550
 you just have to swing the areas 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 their father in the air so here I have 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.970
 thrown a little too much so I know it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.540
 must be well dosed 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.280
 so wait I 'll do that for good 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.720
 in fact this is the hardest foundation 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.860
 to take 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.510
 why because simply there 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.460
 there are only two in height inside 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 so pearl lÃ¤nder has trouble finding accommodation 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 we try here is the fall in have can 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.440
 see I'm in their college so 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 now how to get out of the help 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.070
 how do you make it go 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 like this and that's it no no it's good 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.440
 thirty years from the inside and to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.250
 outside that's how I go and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.420
 outstanding areas yet so if she 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.860
 or what on the sides it's not a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170
 problem that will change nothing this 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 technique works every time it takes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 just that they have at least two of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.600
 author's height it's harder to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.690
 take 3 of author that starts to go 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.630
 4-2 height after that so go got it's 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.000
 on sap a server is forbidden but 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 often it's ok so me everything 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.819
 that I advise to succeed there is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.619
 Perfect is to be nicklas 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.240
 imagined two and a half and a half ago in the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.429
 base you are two with your friend 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.110
 so here we imagine that there are two three 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.030
 people 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.679
 what are you doing sorry you take 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 a potion 10 min 30 of strength 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.149
 you take a golden apple and there you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 get back into how nagging and sight 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.810
 from everyone so here i'm going 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.090
 stand out 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.230
 this is a money and it will throw too 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.550
 to mount p so that's what I tell you 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.900
 advises months after the c1 a jump 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 successful surprise attack and all that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.849
 often I advise you especially 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.860
 actually film every time you do 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.959
 an action like that because often that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 will you treat cheaters what is this 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.689
 which is normal 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.950
 if people do not know the technique 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.900
 may wonder how is that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.980
 you returned without breaking a block 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.390
 so what you do is that you 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.129
 smoke a little hit with hit it's 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.700
 what if you have a pc that tries well 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.579
 and is what the fuck to what were doing 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.620
 its citizens 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.120
 you do so after they are going to be 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.909
 holder ak and you see this with a 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.680
 enemy show you the video and the 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.450
 turn is played so you take the fac 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.480
 of assault you want what it is and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.409
 then it will win you the school 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.819
 after that time it's a college by 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:09.959
 example where there is a gold like that there is 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.430
 a gold do it then if you want 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.299
 wear or wear it high the doorman 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.489
 this is where in there is a gold in 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.189
 do it and you can not break it so 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.420
 the key points but we will say that there 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:26.430
 where do I go crazy the shrink is the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.260
 end of the key points here here here I 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.170
 can break the cubes but then I can 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.010
 not there I can not but here I can so 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.639
 what you do you take 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.260
 obsidian is best for the 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.870
 do you take the daily like this 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.230
 you dig like that so wait for me 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.599
 do not want to go too early for good 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.019
 explain to you so here you have it 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.470
 so this is one you will be born the tnt 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.609
 you take reston tench so 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.949
 there what you did you go 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.750
 spend time here and tnt so has it 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.190
 of tnt it's really to be sure there 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.949
 I'm going squarely in place and a 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.389
 that will not be enough 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.150
 side you go back you replace the 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.379
 where wines made flat a while it 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.209
 will break out the part of which so do the 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.979
 cannon and doll does not always work well 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.340
 that's where you see I make you too close 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.510
 in fact so he has it broke the door 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.479
 I have to make them do it to me is 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.150
 not hear that are up like that you 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.530
 can avoid such was the you 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.639
 do it hop like that in my the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.190
 grasshopper exploded after that we can 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.889
 see that we are going in very good 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.080
 level of discretion is not the top 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.090
 after six or the key points go up to 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.830
 there for example where it will be harder 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.150
 so you will have to make a gun so the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.620
 case number there are plenty of videos that 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.639
 are on the guns me I 'll do a 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.889
 video on tnt channels also a day 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.699
 uh you see it's very easy to 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.069
 storm a large crowd 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:55.360
 daily though if you do not have it 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.319
 door or what if there is no 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.960
 flaw to enter that it's a bubble 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:02.020
 in obsidian and allowed himself on 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.759
 your server and that below you 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.270
 can not spend the best thing 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.289
 shit 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.610
 the best thing to do is to 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.060
 to make a tnt channel that is a bit far 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.610
 in question is to break underneath and 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:18.159
 like that you will have this passage there and 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:20.139
 after you go back 1 hour pearl and 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.789
 so that's short, that's all for this 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.719
 video so how do we build a base 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.610
 floxy come to them I think I have 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.819
 received but pretty much both the two 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.960
 stuff montminy channels TNT and wholesale 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.819
 under pearls 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.319
 I advise you to have at least 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.930
 sneijder perch serves sometimes you do 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.919
 not what you see also loses 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.719
 a lot of life doing this 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.789
 technique what it takes with the honor 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.159
 pearls so you take a skin of a 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.449
 two-minute freeze and you do it and 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.830
 where a pop to the very young of 22 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.520
 seconds to be largely sufficient I think 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.009
 and you do that so surprise attacks 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.610
 gg after you have the beuze for you 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:01.020
 what do I say to you baye and at the 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.020
 next for another tip pp
