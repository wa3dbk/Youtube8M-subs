really didn't want to make one but I had
more<00:00:22.949> than<00:00:23.010> enough<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.760> guys<00:00:23.939> asking<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.630> it

more than enough you guys asking for it
so<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.920> gonna<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.750> I've<00:00:27.750> seen<00:00:27.930> some

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
so we're gonna do one and I've seen some

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
so we're gonna do one and I've seen some
attempts<00:00:28.500> at<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.010> doing<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.310> all

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
attempts at it and you're doing it all

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.510 
attempts at it and you're doing it all
wrong<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.150> how<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.920> um<00:00:31.920> there

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
wrong so this is how to do it um there

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
wrong so this is how to do it um there
we<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.200> where

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
we go that's what it is and it's where

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.040 
we go that's what it is and it's where
the<00:00:34.440> bullet<00:00:34.770> comes<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.480> cool

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the bullet comes in and it's all cool

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.010 
the bullet comes in and it's all cool
and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.980> goes<00:00:38.129> shooting<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and then it goes shooting in and you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.139 
and then it goes shooting in and you
will<00:00:40.170> need<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> download<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.190> video<00:00:41.610> clip<00:00:41.910> and

suicide<00:01:15.299> shots<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> best<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
suicide shots are the best for it and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.700 
suicide shots are the best for it and
it's<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.220> open<00:01:17.580> area<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.680> to

it's an open area but if you do want to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
it's an open area but if you do want to
record<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> cinematic<00:01:21.000> yourself<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
record the cinematic yourself all it is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
record the cinematic yourself all it is
is<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.470> find<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> pivot<00:01:23.340> point<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
is you find like a pivot point and you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
is you find like a pivot point and you
do<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> 360<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.220> put<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.549> down<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
do a 360 there so if I put this down to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.810 
do a 360 there so if I put this down to
half<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.479> hit<00:01:27.630> play<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.369> that's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
half and hit play you see it's that's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.190 
half and hit play you see it's that's
going<00:01:30.150> slow<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.720> how<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.020> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
going slow there we go how it's just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160 
going slow there we go how it's just
kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.540> don't<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.990> do

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
kind of like a you just I don't know do

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
kind of like a you just I don't know do
like<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.320> 360<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.430> where<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> bullet

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
like a 360 on like where the bullet

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.170 
like a 360 on like where the bullet
would<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.979> then<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.579> follow<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
would be and then you just follow it and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.490 
would be and then you just follow it and
this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.420> obviously<00:01:39.570> skilled<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this is obviously skilled up and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.740 
this is obviously skilled up and
everything<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> is

get rid of that and all these and that
and<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.290> ok<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.799> got<00:01:55.979> our<00:01:56.219> our<00:01:56.850> clip

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and that ok so here we got our our clip

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.859 
and that ok so here we got our our clip
that<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> use<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.570> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that we want to use and it is just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.880 
that we want to use and it is just
simply<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.680> shot<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.790> highrise<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
simply a shot on highrise so all it is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
simply a shot on highrise so all it is
is<00:02:05.159> he<00:02:05.280> does<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> spin<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> then<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.840> cut<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
is he does the spin and then we cut the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.559 
is he does the spin and then we cut the
frame<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.770> right<00:02:08.099> where<00:02:08.250> he<00:02:08.399> shoots<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.300> rate

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
frame out right where he shoots so rate

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.340 
frame out right where he shoots so rate
then

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
then

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.690 
then
ere<00:02:10.440> he<00:02:10.650> shoots<00:02:11.040> actually<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.490> back<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
ere he shoots actually and go back a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.300 
ere he shoots actually and go back a
little<00:02:11.910> bit<00:02:12.380> he<00:02:13.380> shoots<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.190> going

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
little bit he shoots and then it's going

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.950 
little bit he shoots and then it's going
to<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.520> bullet<00:02:15.060> bullet<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.570> haven't<00:02:15.840> made<00:02:15.930> it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
to go bullet bullet we haven't made it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.240 
to go bullet bullet we haven't made it
yet<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.680> bullet<00:02:17.100> bullet

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
yet but it's going to be bullet bullet

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.030 
yet but it's going to be bullet bullet
and<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:18.390> right<00:02:19.200> after<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.560> i've<00:02:19.860> added

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and then right after that i've added

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.430 
and then right after that i've added
twitch<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.360> then<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.260> goes

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
twitch on there and then it just goes

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.230 
twitch on there and then it just goes
twixtor<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.190> goes<00:02:23.340> down<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.940> but

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
twixtor and it goes down like that but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.640 
twixtor and it goes down like that but
that's<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.630> main<00:02:24.810> part<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.530> pretty

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that's the main part of it it's pretty

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.980 
that's the main part of it it's pretty
easy<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.190> let's<00:02:26.310> jump<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.840> any

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
easy so let's jump in so we have any

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.840 
easy so let's jump in so we have any
composition<00:02:28.440> here<00:02:28.980> first<00:02:29.370> thing<00:02:29.460> we<00:02:29.610> want<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
composition here first thing we want to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.430 
composition here first thing we want to
do<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.090> bring<00:02:30.210> our<00:02:30.360> cinematics<00:02:30.930> down<00:02:31.140> so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
do is bring our cinematics down so

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.810 
do is bring our cinematics down so
here's<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.890> ones<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.370> used<00:02:34.040> right<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.400> put

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
here's the ones I used right here put

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.510 
here's the ones I used right here put
them<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:36.000> get<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.720> there<00:02:37.130> all<00:02:38.130> right<00:02:38.310> beautiful

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
them on get on there all right beautiful

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.930 
them on get on there all right beautiful
so<00:02:39.140> we're<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.890> where<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.220> cut<00:02:41.670> them

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
so we're going to go to where I cut them

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.630 
so we're going to go to where I cut them
so<00:02:42.450> right<00:02:43.110> here's<00:02:43.530> where<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.710> started<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.340> turn

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
so right here's where I started to turn

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.690 
so right here's where I started to turn
so<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.390> end<00:02:45.810> bracket<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.460> go<00:02:47.580> so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
so all end bracket and there we go so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.580 
so all end bracket and there we go so
there's<00:02:47.880> our<00:02:48.060> cinematic<00:02:48.630> for<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.020> shot<00:02:49.410> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
there's our cinematic for the shot and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.350 
there's our cinematic for the shot and
it<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.890> goes<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> circle<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
it just goes in a circle like that and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.920 
it just goes in a circle like that and
it's<00:02:51.510> pretty<00:02:51.750> straightforward<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:53.930> where

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
it's pretty straightforward and where

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
it's pretty straightforward and where
does<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.110> end<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.920> ends<00:02:56.100> right<00:02:56.220> about<00:02:56.490> there

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
does it end it ends right about there

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.820 
does it end it ends right about there
okay<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.090> what<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.900> want<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.140> do<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.410> go<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> like

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
okay so what we want to do is go to like

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.590 
okay so what we want to do is go to like
the<00:02:58.860> middle<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.700> our<00:02:59.790> cinematic<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.450> just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the middle of our cinematic and just

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.870 
the middle of our cinematic and just
place<00:03:00.810> our<00:03:00.990> cursor<00:03:01.140> there<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.740> now<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.610> right

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
place our cursor there for now so right

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.260 
place our cursor there for now so right
around<00:03:03.530> about<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:05.340> because<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.090> where

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
around about here because that's where

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.390 
around about here because that's where
the<00:03:06.330> bullet<00:03:06.600> would<00:03:06.690> be<00:03:06.840> flying<00:03:07.310> we're<00:03:08.310> going

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the bullet would be flying we're going

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400 
the bullet would be flying we're going
to<00:03:08.490> s<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.060> our<00:03:09.180> keyboard<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.990> scale<00:03:10.260> up

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
to s on our keyboard and just scale up

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.460 
to s on our keyboard and just scale up
the<00:03:10.440> cinematics<00:03:11.130> because<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:12.140> we<00:03:13.140> don't<00:03:13.320> need

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
the cinematics because I we don't need

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.470 
the cinematics because I we don't need
to<00:03:13.560> see<00:03:13.680> anything<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.070> top<00:03:14.340> go<00:03:14.970> for<00:03:15.240> maybe

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
to see anything on the top go for maybe

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.150 
to see anything on the top go for maybe
a<00:03:15.510> little<00:03:15.690> bit<00:03:15.900> okay<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.500> go<00:03:16.620> there's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
a little bit okay so there we go there's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.560 
a little bit okay so there we go there's
our<00:03:17.280> cinematic<00:03:17.790> that's<00:03:17.970> where<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.240> want<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
our cinematic that's where we want the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.020 
our cinematic that's where we want the
bullet<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.020> be<00:03:19.280> when<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.430> perfectly

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
bullet to be when it's perfectly

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.480 
bullet to be when it's perfectly
straight<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:22.560> we're<00:03:22.710> going<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
straight so now we're going to get the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.950 
straight so now we're going to get the
bullet<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.090> said<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.420> download<00:03:24.750> links

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
bullet so like I said the download links

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.610 
bullet so like I said the download links
in<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> description<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.810> bullet<00:03:28.530> is

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
in the description and the bullet is

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.620 
in the description and the bullet is
right<00:03:28.800> here<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.490> we're<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.240> put<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.510> on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
right here so we're going to put it on

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.540 
right here so we're going to put it on
you<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.560> see<00:03:31.710> right<00:03:31.740> now<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.310> green

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
you can see right now it's a green

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.400 
you can see right now it's a green
screen<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.930> bullet<00:03:34.230> comes

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
screen and it's just a bullet comes

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.620 
screen and it's just a bullet comes
flying<00:03:34.710> in<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.310> slides<00:03:35.550> out<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.030> there's<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
flying in and slides out so there's a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
flying in and slides out so there's a
lot<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.810> ways<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.050> get<00:03:37.200> where<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.440> green

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
lot of ways to get where the green

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.530 
lot of ways to get where the green
screen<00:03:37.920> my<00:03:38.220> opinion<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> best<00:03:38.910> way<00:03:39.240> is<00:03:39.510> to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
screen my opinion the best way is to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.540 
screen my opinion the best way is to
look<00:03:39.870> up<00:03:40.050> for<00:03:40.260> an<00:03:40.320> effect<00:03:40.620> called<00:03:40.710> key<00:03:41.280> light

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
look up for an effect called key light

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.720 
look up for an effect called key light
chelating<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.780> some<00:03:43.020> 1.2<00:03:43.470> put<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.490> on<00:03:44.580> your

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
chelating on some 1.2 put that on your

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.700 
chelating on some 1.2 put that on your
bullet<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.300> then<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.780> uh<00:03:46.020> where<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.560> says

it's on half quality there we go we can

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.460 
it's on half quality there we go we can
see<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.300> looks<00:04:00.480> ugly<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.080> get<00:04:01.290> rid<00:04:01.440> of

that<00:04:01.710> we<00:04:01.950> go<00:04:02.130> over<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.370> screen<00:04:02.880> mat<00:04:03.240> in<00:04:03.900> recess

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
that we go over to screen mat in recess

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.080 
that we go over to screen mat in recess
clip<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.680> black<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.400> bring<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.730> up<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.940> little

clip on black just bring it up a little

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.050 
clip on black just bring it up a little
bit<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.540> like<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.900> don't<00:04:06.960> know<00:04:07.050> 50<00:04:07.530> maybe<00:04:08.060> all

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
bit to like I don't know 50 maybe all

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.370 
bit to like I don't know 50 maybe all
right<00:04:09.330> enough<00:04:09.570> see<00:04:09.720> what<00:04:09.870> if<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.080> gets<00:04:10.110> too

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
right enough see what if it gets too

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.900 
right enough see what if it gets too
high<00:04:10.560> close<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.980> transparent<00:04:11.580> we<00:04:11.640> don't<00:04:11.790> want

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
high close a transparent we don't want

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.450 
high close a transparent we don't want
that<00:04:11.970> we<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.540> wanted<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.900> like<00:04:13.130> like<00:04:14.130> like

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
that we just wanted it like like like

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.370 
that we just wanted it like like like
very<00:04:14.730> off<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.120> like<00:04:15.270> I'm<00:04:15.390> 25<00:04:15.930> whole<00:04:16.140> work<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
very off so like I'm 25 whole work I

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.960 
very off so like I'm 25 whole work I
guess<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.280> there<00:04:17.400> you're<00:04:17.580> not<00:04:17.700> at<00:04:17.790> all<00:04:17.880> of

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
guess and there you're not at all of

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.110 
guess and there you're not at all of
that<00:04:18.120> white<00:04:18.330> line<00:04:18.570> and

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
that white line and

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.150 
that white line and
looks<00:04:19.239> good<00:04:19.479> so<00:04:20.290> that's<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.769> basic<00:04:21.600> makeup

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
looks good so that's the basic makeup

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.980 
looks good so that's the basic makeup
yeah<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.190> guess<00:04:24.460> green<00:04:24.699> screen<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.900> now

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
yeah I guess green screen of it so now

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.260 
yeah I guess green screen of it so now
we're<00:04:26.139> going<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.290> slide<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:27.220> over<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:28.000> where

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
we're going to slide this over to where

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.790 
we're going to slide this over to where
it's<00:04:28.479> in<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> middle<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.229> there<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.530> go<00:04:29.560> it's

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
it's in the middle so there we go it's

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.219 
it's in the middle so there we go it's
in<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.010> middle<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.610> our<00:04:30.760> thing<00:04:31.180> now<00:04:31.960> we<00:04:32.050> go<00:04:32.199> to

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
in the middle of our thing now we go to

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.409 
in the middle of our thing now we go to
this<00:04:32.470> end<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.010> cinematic<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.820> we<00:04:34.210> just

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
this end of the cinematic and we just

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.030 
this end of the cinematic and we just
get<00:04:34.720> rid<00:04:34.870> of<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.050> beginning<00:04:35.320> part<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.919> there

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
get rid of the beginning part and there

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.420 
get rid of the beginning part and there
it<00:04:36.160> goes<00:04:36.400> um<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.900> then<00:04:38.080> over<00:04:38.620> this<00:04:38.800> side<00:04:39.130> in

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
it goes um and then over this side in

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.110 
it goes um and then over this side in
the<00:04:39.699> same<00:04:39.910> thing<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.830> can<00:04:41.860> fiddle<00:04:42.820> with<00:04:42.970> it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
the same thing so you can fiddle with it

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.030 
the same thing so you can fiddle with it
a<00:04:43.330> little<00:04:43.479> bit<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:43.990> make<00:04:44.410> your<00:04:44.560> cinematics

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
a little bit like make your cinematics

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.860 
a little bit like make your cinematics
longer<00:04:45.370> because<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:45.790> an<00:04:45.970> awful<00:04:46.360> long<00:04:46.510> green

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
longer because it is an awful long green

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.270 
longer because it is an awful long green
screen<00:04:47.260> like<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.620> see<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.889> goes<00:04:48.040> all<00:04:48.250> the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
screen like you can see it goes all the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.510 
screen like you can see it goes all the
way<00:04:48.460> on<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:49.150> fast<00:04:49.479> here<00:04:49.810> but<00:04:50.770> we<00:04:51.310> don't<00:04:51.460> have

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
way on it fast here but we don't have

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.730 
way on it fast here but we don't have
time<00:04:51.639> for<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.090> right<00:04:52.419> now<00:04:52.600> I<00:04:52.750> didn't<00:04:53.169> record

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
time for that right now I didn't record

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.830 
time for that right now I didn't record
long<00:04:53.949> enough<00:04:54.130> cinematic<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.300> now<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.510> big

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
long enough cinematic so now the big

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.930 
long enough cinematic so now the big
secret<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.289> makes<00:04:56.860> it<00:04:57.070> look<00:04:57.280> good<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:57.669> kind

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
secret that makes it look good it's kind

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.750 
secret that makes it look good it's kind
of<00:04:58.000> key<00:04:58.240> is<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.780> scale<00:04:59.199> your<00:04:59.260> cinematic<00:04:59.979> up<00:05:00.340> as

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
of key is to scale your cinematic up as

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.200 
of key is to scale your cinematic up as
it's<00:05:01.360> like<00:05:01.919> like<00:05:02.919> yours<00:05:03.220> like<00:05:03.550> it's<00:05:03.760> zooming

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
it's like like yours like it's zooming

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.779 
it's like like yours like it's zooming
in<00:05:04.389> so<00:05:04.660> we<00:05:05.199> got<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:05.530> pretty<00:05:06.310> much<00:05:06.520> rate

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
in so we got it pretty much rate

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.390 
in so we got it pretty much rate
centered<00:05:07.449> now<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:08.470> I'm<00:05:08.710> right<00:05:09.160> where<00:05:09.310> the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
centered now so I'm right where the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.770 
centered now so I'm right where the
bullet<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:09.760> head<00:05:10.060> on<00:05:10.240> we're<00:05:10.600> going<00:05:10.690> to

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
bullet is head on we're going to

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.810 
bullet is head on we're going to
keyframe<00:05:11.199> our<00:05:11.470> scale<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.160> bring<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.490> way<00:05:12.789> up

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
keyframe our scale and bring it way up

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.990 
keyframe our scale and bring it way up
there<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.539> lay<00:05:14.100> three<00:05:15.100> hundred<00:05:15.370> percent<00:05:15.760> or

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
there to lay three hundred percent or

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.279 
there to lay three hundred percent or
like<00:05:16.150> two<00:05:16.330> hundred<00:05:16.479> and<00:05:16.750> seventy-five

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
like two hundred and seventy-five

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.950 
like two hundred and seventy-five
percent<00:05:17.590> will<00:05:17.919> go<00:05:18.039> with<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.460> then<00:05:19.389> we're

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
percent will go with and then we're

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.450 
percent will go with and then we're
going<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.110> go<00:05:20.169> back<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.650> beginning<00:05:20.860> and

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
going to go back to the beginning and

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.430 
going to go back to the beginning and
we're<00:05:21.850> just<00:05:21.910> going<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.180> bring<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:22.419> down<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:23.080> lot

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
we're just going to bring it down a lot

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.159 
we're just going to bring it down a lot
so<00:05:23.710> down<00:05:23.950> too<00:05:24.190> late<00:05:26.220> 130<00:05:27.360> see<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.450> scales<00:05:28.870> in

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
so down too late 130 see it scales in

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.460 
so down too late 130 see it scales in
and<00:05:29.470> then<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.820> scales<00:05:31.360> out<00:05:31.630> at<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:32.139> end<00:05:32.169> which

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
and then it scales out at the end which

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.900 
and then it scales out at the end which
we<00:05:32.590> have<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.770> keyframe<00:05:33.039> again<00:05:33.370> too<00:05:33.550> so<00:05:33.760> then

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
we have to keyframe again too so then

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.430 
we have to keyframe again too so then
just<00:05:34.030> go<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.389> end<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:34.660> key<00:05:34.840> frame<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.229> down

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
just go to the end and key frame it down

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.430 
just go to the end and key frame it down
to<00:05:36.340> like<00:05:36.460> there<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.150> that<00:05:37.389> way<00:05:37.599> it<00:05:37.930> just<00:05:37.960> makes

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
to like there and that way it just makes

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.000 
to like there and that way it just makes
it<00:05:38.650> it<00:05:38.889> doesn't<00:05:39.669> have<00:05:40.030> as<00:05:40.270> much<00:05:40.450> avada<00:05:40.860> like<00:05:41.860> a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
it it doesn't have as much avada like a

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.860 
it it doesn't have as much avada like a
weird<00:05:42.250> effect<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.789> kind<00:05:43.000> of<00:05:43.060> emphasizes<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
weird effect it kind of emphasizes the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.650 
weird effect it kind of emphasizes the
bullet<00:05:44.320> more<00:05:44.590> so<00:05:45.400> that's<00:05:46.060> it<00:05:46.150> so<00:05:46.300> we<00:05:46.389> got<00:05:46.539> our

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
bullet more so that's it so we got our

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.350 
bullet more so that's it so we got our
composition<00:05:47.320> they're<00:05:47.500> right<00:05:47.830> here<00:05:47.860> um<00:05:48.490> we<00:05:49.210> can

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
composition they're right here um we can

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.000 
composition they're right here um we can
rename<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.870> if<00:05:50.080> we<00:05:50.229> want<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.530> do<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:50.830> later

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
rename it if we want to do that later

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.580 
rename it if we want to do that later
but<00:05:51.220> so<00:05:51.699> we<00:05:51.789> got<00:05:51.910> a<00:05:51.940> shot<00:05:52.690> over<00:05:52.960> here<00:05:53.289> set<00:05:53.560> up

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
but so we got a shot over here set up

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.560 
but so we got a shot over here set up
we're<00:05:53.830> going<00:05:53.919> to<00:05:54.010> add<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:54.220> bullet<00:05:54.550> in<00:05:54.669> now<00:05:54.880> and

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
we're going to add the bullet in now and

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.810 
we're going to add the bullet in now and
to<00:05:55.750> do<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:55.900> just<00:05:56.440> look<00:05:57.070> for<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.280> composition

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
to do that just look for the composition

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.689 
to do that just look for the composition
in<00:05:57.910> your<00:05:58.000> project<00:05:58.539> file<00:05:58.810> so<00:05:59.139> right<00:05:59.349> here<00:05:59.800> put

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
in your project file so right here put

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.420 
in your project file so right here put
her<00:06:00.789> in<00:06:00.970> there<00:06:01.150> get<00:06:01.479> in<00:06:01.510> there<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:02.070> we<00:06:03.070> have<00:06:03.190> to

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
her in there get in there and we have to

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.409 
her in there get in there and we have to
enable<00:06:04.180> some<00:06:04.720> it<00:06:04.900> time<00:06:05.320> remapping<00:06:06.190> so<00:06:07.090> right

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
enable some it time remapping so right

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.010 
enable some it time remapping so right
click<00:06:07.690> go<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.349> time<00:06:09.419> enable<00:06:10.419> time<00:06:10.570> remapping

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
click go to time enable time remapping

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.770 
click go to time enable time remapping
and<00:06:11.410> because<00:06:11.740> we<00:06:12.490> got<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.669> find<00:06:12.880> the<00:06:13.060> end<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.570> it

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
and because we got to find the end of it

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.200 
and because we got to find the end of it
where<00:06:14.410> it<00:06:14.470> goes<00:06:14.590> black<00:06:14.979> so<00:06:15.400> we<00:06:15.699> gotta<00:06:15.910> there's

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
where it goes black so we gotta there's

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.670 
where it goes black so we gotta there's
the<00:06:16.570> bullet<00:06:16.900> there's<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.199> bull<00:06:17.349> and<00:06:17.470> then<00:06:17.590> it

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
the bullet there's the bull and then it

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.330 
the bullet there's the bull and then it
just<00:06:17.770> goes<00:06:18.030> right<00:06:19.030> there<00:06:19.300> okay<00:06:19.440> so<00:06:20.440> with<00:06:21.190> that

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
just goes right there okay so with that

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.640 
just goes right there okay so with that
we're<00:06:21.699> going<00:06:21.789> to<00:06:21.880> make<00:06:22.720> a<00:06:22.780> key<00:06:23.020> frame<00:06:23.320> right

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
we're going to make a key frame right

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.219 
we're going to make a key frame right
here<00:06:23.710> at<00:06:24.190> worthy<00:06:24.580> end<00:06:24.760> like<00:06:25.120> we're<00:06:25.330> that<00:06:25.539> last

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
here at worthy end like we're that last

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.430 
here at worthy end like we're that last
part<00:06:26.680> of<00:06:26.949> this<00:06:27.630> bullet<00:06:28.630> effect<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.110> want<00:06:29.260> to

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
part of this bullet effect you want to

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.080 
part of this bullet effect you want to
be<00:06:29.620> is<00:06:29.740> like<00:06:30.039> that<00:06:30.159> last<00:06:30.370> thing<00:06:30.610> make<00:06:30.789> your<00:06:30.820> key

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
be is like that last thing make your key

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.970 
be is like that last thing make your key
frame<00:06:31.419> and<00:06:32.020> go<00:06:32.169> to<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.409> BG

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
frame and go to the BG

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.360 
frame and go to the BG
inning<00:06:33.420> drag<00:06:34.420> the<00:06:34.450> side<00:06:34.990> all<00:06:35.290> the<00:06:35.320> way<00:06:35.710> in<00:06:36.040> and

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
inning drag the side all the way in and

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.340 
inning drag the side all the way in and
then<00:06:36.490> bring<00:06:36.730> the<00:06:36.850> key<00:06:37.090> frame<00:06:37.420> in<00:06:37.630> with<00:06:37.930> you<00:06:38.170> so

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
then bring the key frame in with you so

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.280 
then bring the key frame in with you so
it's<00:06:38.500> that<00:06:38.860> easy<00:06:39.160> um<00:06:39.690> if<00:06:40.690> you<00:06:40.840> didn't<00:06:41.140> catch

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
that I just you know make your key frame

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.320 
that I just you know make your key frame
where<00:06:44.740> you<00:06:44.830> want<00:06:45.010> the<00:06:45.070> bullet<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.400> end<00:06:45.580> bring

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
where you want the bullet to end bring

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.100 
where you want the bullet to end bring
it<00:06:46.480> in<00:06:46.660> and<00:06:48.030> you<00:06:49.030> know<00:06:49.150> just<00:06:49.180> move<00:06:49.840> the<00:06:49.990> key

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
it in and you know just move the key

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.780 
it in and you know just move the key
from<00:06:50.290> over<00:06:50.560> if<00:06:50.650> you<00:06:50.740> have<00:06:50.830> this<00:06:51.010> black<00:06:51.310> screen

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
from over if you have this black screen

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.490 
from over if you have this black screen
after<00:06:52.000> this<00:06:52.300> you<00:06:52.510> did<00:06:52.660> something<00:06:53.050> wrong<00:06:53.230> just
