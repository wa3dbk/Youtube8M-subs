00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.190
 made a remake of the output of the factories 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.590
 except that workers and workers 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.789
 factory lights have been replaced by 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.789
 the players and the player and the Olympic 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.599
 Lyon 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.050
 it was funny because according to the 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.759
 versions 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.890
 at first there was a lot of shyness 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.590
 and then after they had feeling that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.149
 the buddies had a little done things 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.420
 they tried to play with the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.099
 ball 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 I found girls a little bit more 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.750
 smart that boys, that is to say 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.090
 a little bit more not an actress but 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.310
 in any case as it was she who opened 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.520
 the procession as 120 years ago of the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.590
 blow they did that very well and then 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.020
 as soon as the idea seems to have understood that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.760

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.330
