the cloud is impossible and shows that

the cloud is impossible and shows that
is<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> fairly<00:02:05.610> reasonable<00:02:06.180> question<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.810> Mark

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
is a fairly reasonable question and Mark

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.229 
is a fairly reasonable question and Mark

each<00:02:55.890> game<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.430> taking<00:02:56.790> up<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.480> course<00:02:57.510> you

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
each game is taking up and of course you

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.960 
each game is taking up and of course you
don't<00:02:58.470> need<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.739> worry<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.760> cloud

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
don't need to worry about the cloud

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.090 
don't need to worry about the cloud
going<00:03:00.269> down<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:01.019> your<00:03:01.050> saves<00:03:01.440> are<00:03:01.739> stored

going down as all your saves are stored

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.880 
going down as all your saves are stored
and<00:03:02.340> locally<00:03:02.760> would<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:03.720> nice<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.709> ability

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.160 
and locally would be nice if the ability
to<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:05.459> your<00:03:05.640> remaining<00:03:06.390> space<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:06.930> added

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
to see your remaining space was added

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.840 
to see your remaining space was added
say<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.500> future<00:03:07.769> patch<00:03:08.010> or<00:03:08.340> something<00:03:08.760> like

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
say in a future patch or something like

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.810 
say in a future patch or something like
that<00:03:08.910> but<00:03:09.900> I'd<00:03:10.290> say<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.980> console<00:03:11.400> breaking

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
that but I'd say it's a console breaking

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.370 
that but I'd say it's a console breaking
thing<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.239> not<00:03:12.420> exactly<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> huge<00:03:13.019> deal<00:03:13.260> in

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
thing it's not exactly the huge deal in

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.990 
thing it's not exactly the huge deal in
the<00:03:13.470> world<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.920> minor<00:03:14.220> annoyance<00:03:14.430> or

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
the world just a minor annoyance or

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.750 
the world just a minor annoyance or
hopefully<00:03:15.300> they'll<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.600> added<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.370> still<00:03:17.370> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
hopefully they'll be added but still it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.030 
hopefully they'll be added but still it
sounds<00:03:18.209> like<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:19.290> everything<00:03:19.650> will<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.799> fine

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
sounds like that everything will be fine

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.710 
sounds like that everything will be fine

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
and so on and of course it will be

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680 
and so on and of course it will be
stored<00:03:23.610> locally<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.030> if<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.209> wish<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
stored locally and if you wish to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.240 
stored locally and if you wish to
connect<00:03:25.079> your<00:03:25.230> Xbox<00:03:25.530> one<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.890> Internet

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
connect your Xbox one to the Internet

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.550 
connect your Xbox one to the Internet
then<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.239> will<00:03:27.329> also<00:03:27.510> be<00:03:27.690> able<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.350> save

then you will also be able to just save

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.380 
then you will also be able to just save
via<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.040> cloud<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.579> then<00:03:29.730> perhaps<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.299> you
