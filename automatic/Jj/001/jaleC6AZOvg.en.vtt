00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so this is our vex IQ platform it's our

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.780 
so this is our vex IQ platform it's our
educational<00:00:03.240> robotics<00:00:03.659> platform<00:00:04.790> brand-new

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
educational robotics platform brand-new

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.990 
educational robotics platform brand-new
a<00:00:05.819> lot<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.270> feedback<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.490> these<00:00:08.490> kids<00:00:08.790> all

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
a lot of feedback from these kids all

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.610 
a lot of feedback from these kids all
like<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.389> oh<00:00:09.540> yeah<00:00:09.840> who's<00:00:10.740> operating<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.400> one

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
like it oh yeah who's operating this one

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.749 
like it oh yeah who's operating this one
you're<00:00:13.620> doing<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.429> let's<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:14.730> what

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you're doing it all right let's see what

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.090 
you're doing it all right let's see what
they'll<00:00:15.089> see<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.470> stuff<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:16.949> my

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
they'll see you do is some stuff here my

they'll see you do is some stuff here my
friend<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:19.310> was<00:00:20.310> asking<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.090> new<00:00:21.359> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.410 

like<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.740> motor<00:00:30.040> or<00:00:30.250> recenter<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.910> does<00:00:31.090> exactly

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
like a motor or recenter it does exactly

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.180

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
controller $300 $300 they tried to keep

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.830 
controller $300 $300 they tried to keep
it<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.840> lot<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.289> value<00:01:26.590> or<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.069> smaller<00:01:27.459> so<00:01:27.969> $300

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
it a lot of value or a smaller so $300

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.139 
it a lot of value or a smaller so $300
like<00:01:29.020> one<00:01:29.289> kit<00:01:29.619> like<00:01:29.979> yep<00:01:30.399> actually<00:01:30.789> this<00:01:30.939> guy

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
like one kit like yep actually this guy

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.539 
like one kit like yep actually this guy
is<00:01:31.209> built<00:01:31.659> from<00:01:31.780> just<00:01:32.020> one<00:01:32.170> kit<00:01:32.409> okay<00:01:33.219> that

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
is built from just one kit okay that

distance sensor touch LED which is
really<00:01:45.630> neat<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.140> disable<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.770> robot<00:01:47.100> just

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
really neat I can disable the robot just

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.500 
really neat I can disable the robot just
by<00:01:48.720> touching<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
by touching it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.070 
by touching it
very<00:01:51.350> cool<00:01:52.730> in<00:01:53.060> addition<00:01:53.480> like<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.690> said<00:01:53.900> our

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
very cool in addition like I said our

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.660 
very cool in addition like I said our
smart<00:01:54.440> motors<00:01:54.740> work<00:01:54.950> right<00:01:55.190> out<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.490> box

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670

how<00:02:27.790> does<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:27.940> compare<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.510> Lego<00:02:28.780> Mindstorms

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
how does it compare to Lego Mindstorms

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920 
how does it compare to Lego Mindstorms
we<00:02:29.860> have<00:02:29.950> small<00:02:30.220> ports<00:02:30.610> instead<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.209> six<00:02:31.450> like

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
we have small ports instead of six like

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.270 
we have small ports instead of six like
we<00:02:32.080> said<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.410> default<00:02:32.830> functionality

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
we said that default functionality

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.830 
we said that default functionality
there's<00:02:33.700> no<00:02:33.849> advanced<00:02:34.180> programming<00:02:34.750> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
there's no advanced programming so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.030 
there's no advanced programming so
you're<00:02:34.989> gonna<00:02:35.080> say<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.470> easier<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.860> use

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
you're gonna say it easier to use

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.430 
you're gonna say it easier to use
definitely<00:02:36.790> easier<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.360> use<00:02:37.510> especially<00:02:38.080> for

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
definitely easier to use especially for

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.380 
definitely easier to use especially for
younger<00:02:38.620> students<00:02:39.129> their<00:02:39.730> attention<00:02:40.150> span<00:02:40.360> is

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
younger students their attention span is

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.210 
younger students their attention span is
short<00:02:40.750> right<00:02:41.260> they<00:02:41.500> want<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.769> work<00:02:41.920> right<00:02:42.160> out

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
short right they want to work right out

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.320 
short right they want to work right out
of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.489> box<00:02:42.640> they<00:02:42.849> don't<00:02:43.000> want<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.180> sit<00:02:43.300> in

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
program it so this one's ready to go

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.979 
program it so this one's ready to go
what<00:02:45.370> about<00:02:45.430> batteries<00:02:45.940> battery<00:02:46.510> life<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
what about batteries battery life is

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.289 
what about batteries battery life is
excellent

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.660 

those<00:02:52.299> are<00:02:52.569> not<00:02:53.110> double-a<00:02:53.560> controller

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.730 

Sally<00:02:58.330> as<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:58.600> say<00:02:58.780> about<00:02:58.990> maybe<00:02:59.440> two<00:02:59.710> hundred

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
Sally as we say about maybe two hundred

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.530 
Sally as we say about maybe two hundred
and<00:03:00.069> twenty<00:03:00.310> hours<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.730> use<00:03:00.850> there<00:03:01.510> are

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
and twenty hours of use there are

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.240 
and twenty hours of use there are
batteries<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.290> came<00:03:02.500> from<00:03:02.620> about<00:03:02.890> once<00:03:03.100> with

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
batteries that came from about once with

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.990 
batteries that came from about once with
a<00:03:03.340> here

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000
