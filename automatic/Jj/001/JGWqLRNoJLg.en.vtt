and then on our device it actually

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.430 
and then on our device it actually
connects<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.880> vibrates<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.720> then<00:02:26.990> lets<00:02:27.260> us

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
King 77 I comm loaded up I can go to how

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.260 
King 77 I comm loaded up I can go to how
to<00:03:08.000> route<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.690> Galaxy<00:03:09.140> Note<00:03:09.350> 2<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.180> there<00:03:11.180> it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
to route the Galaxy Note 2 and there it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.750 
to route the Galaxy Note 2 and there it
is<00:03:11.360> loading<00:03:12.080> up<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.470> would<00:03:13.010> be<00:03:13.040> me<00:03:13.310> connected

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
is loading up that would be me connected

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.340 
is loading up that would be me connected
to<00:03:13.850> my<00:03:13.970> Android<00:03:14.390> tether<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> bottom<00:03:15.230> right

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
to my Android tether in the bottom right

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.410 
to my Android tether in the bottom right
hand<00:03:15.380> corner<00:03:15.650> does<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.340> Android<00:03:16.820> tether<00:03:17.150> and

hand corner does the Android tether and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.009 
hand corner does the Android tether and
that's<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:20.060> that's<00:03:20.239> how<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.540> get<00:03:20.750> free

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
that's it so that's how to get free

that<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.440> do<00:04:03.560> know<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:03.950> also<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:04.970> believe<00:04:05.150> Wi-Fi

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that I do know of also I believe Wi-Fi

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.520 
that I do know of also I believe Wi-Fi
encryption<00:04:06.290> does<00:04:07.010> work<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:08.450> hasn't<00:04:09.350> in<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
encryption does work it hasn't in the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.710 
encryption does work it hasn't in the
past<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.610> might<00:04:10.910> not<00:04:11.060> work<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.360> some<00:04:11.570> of<00:04:11.690> my

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
past so it might not work for some of my

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.150 
past so it might not work for some of my
work<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.230> others<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:12.650> leave<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.860> comment

work for others you can leave a comment
let<00:04:13.370> me<00:04:13.400> know<00:04:13.549> if<00:04:13.670> Wi-Fi<00:04:14.239> encryption<00:04:14.450> works

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
let me know if Wi-Fi encryption works

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.300 
let me know if Wi-Fi encryption works
for<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.200> but<00:04:15.470> what<00:04:16.310> does<00:04:16.549> work<00:04:16.910> would<00:04:17.329> be<00:04:18.310> it's

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
for you but what does work would be it's

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.420 
for you but what does work would be it's
sorry<00:04:19.910> let<00:04:20.120> me<00:04:20.150> go<00:04:20.329> back<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:21.070> access<00:04:22.070> control

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
sorry let me go back and access control

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.909 
sorry let me go back and access control
works<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.030> enable<00:04:23.539> access<00:04:23.720> control<00:04:24.349> what

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
works so you enable access control what

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.680 
works so you enable access control what
that<00:04:25.070> allows<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.669> to<00:04:25.789> do<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.090> when

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
that allows you to do is when

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.880 
that allows you to do is when
they<00:04:26.810> connect<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.320> will<00:04:27.740> actually

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
they connect so I will actually

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.200 
they connect so I will actually
demonstrate<00:04:28.640> it<00:04:28.730> so<00:04:28.790> I'm<00:04:28.850> going<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.030> start

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
demonstrate it so I'm going to start

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.730 
demonstrate it so I'm going to start
tethering<00:04:29.660> then<00:04:30.170> I'm<00:04:30.260> going<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.470> try<00:04:30.650> and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
tethering then I'm going to try and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.310 
tethering then I'm going to try and
connect<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.280> from<00:04:31.310> my<00:04:31.670> PC<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.930> let<00:04:33.080> me<00:04:33.200> go

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
connect to it from my PC so let me go

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.280 
connect to it from my PC so let me go
ahead<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.590> connect<00:04:34.460> on<00:04:34.640> my<00:04:34.790> laptop<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.990> then

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
ahead and connect on my laptop and then

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.380 
ahead and connect on my laptop and then
you<00:04:36.410> will<00:04:36.560> notice<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:37.000> it'll<00:04:38.000> bring<00:04:38.210> up

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
you will notice that it'll bring up

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.750 
you will notice that it'll bring up
it'll<00:04:38.690> actually<00:04:38.930> vibrate<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:39.560> then<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.580> will

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
it'll actually vibrate and then it will

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.970 
it'll actually vibrate and then it will
bring<00:04:41.270> up<00:04:41.390> a<00:04:41.540> prompt<00:04:41.990> where<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.200> have<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.680> allow

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
bring up a prompt where I have to allow

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.090 
bring up a prompt where I have to allow
it<00:04:43.010> control<00:04:43.640> my<00:04:43.790> computer<00:04:44.240> control<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:45.500> get<00:04:45.650> to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
it control my computer control to get to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.880 
it control my computer control to get to
gain<00:04:46.310> internet<00:04:46.760> access<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.480> here<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.140> waiting

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
gain internet access on here so waiting

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.070 
gain internet access on here so waiting
for<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.190> connect<00:04:49.550> alright<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:50.690> I'm<00:04:50.780> trying

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
for it to connect alright so I'm trying

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.360 
for it to connect alright so I'm trying
to<00:04:51.110> connect<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:51.560> doesn't<00:04:51.830> seem<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.100> be<00:04:52.160> working

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
to connect it doesn't seem to be working

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.610 
to connect it doesn't seem to be working
it<00:04:52.640> just<00:04:52.670> as<00:04:52.970> no<00:04:53.120> internet<00:04:53.570> access<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:54.320> maybe

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
it just as no internet access so maybe

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.130 
it just as no internet access so maybe
excess<00:04:55.250> control<00:04:55.670> does<00:04:55.880> not<00:04:55.910> work<00:04:56.330> I'm<00:04:57.080> not

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
excess control does not work I'm not

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.800 
excess control does not work I'm not
