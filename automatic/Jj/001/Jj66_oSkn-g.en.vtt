00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
opinion I'm gonna say the old tradition

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
opinion I'm gonna say the old tradition
because<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> better<00:00:45.090> game<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.690> much

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
because it's a better game and it's much

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.330 
because it's a better game and it's much
better<00:00:46.140> packaging<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.829> things<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> come

better packaging and things that come

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
better packaging and things that come
with<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.820> better<00:00:48.059> value<00:00:48.420> but

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
with it it's just better value but

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
with it it's just better value but
that's<00:00:49.379> not<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.739> me<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> judge<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.640> you
