00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:17.630
 so according to the method 1 internet guru 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.630
 I did these beds 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:31.520
 high since i have a lowland here 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:35.610
 You can see here is such a lowland 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.860
 in the spring I have half a meter of water on 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.260
 plot costs 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:47.489
 i'm still in this way decided to raise 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:54.960
 plot since i am near the forest 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 I have vegetation here Nemer 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.680
 mostly true eh x So I branch 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:08.420
 all the trees all there is old hemp 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.420
 I throw everything down, he can even be seen 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 logs all all you can throw everything there 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.579
 otherwise, they don't grow in me 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.990
 the trees 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:32.060
 But I try to lift the boxes 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 here he planted cherries here with me 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:41.420
 cherry floor moscow wild where dug 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:46.250
 there I have cherry cherry and pear transplanted 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 from this place here I have trees that 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.950
 it happens 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 cheese after a hard year everyone froze 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:07.069
 Here is this pear already years fucking here she 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.750
 sits and grew well literally centimes on 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:14.120
 40 50 but a little more than that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:21.609
 This apple tree even more in general nisin 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:30.280
 nizin and nizin again there you can see 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:30.280
 marsh water still stands on May 4 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:41.200
 there was a terrible lowland here 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.980
 here I sprinkled the poet's logs and fell asleep 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.110
 beds can now even walk in them 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.660
 so i planted 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:55.140
 strawberry same bed 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:03:01.080
 let's see this nonwoven 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:05.500
 I covered the report I will put you fell 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.500
 strawberry ripening as it goes I 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.950
 bought new varieties elizabeth second there 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.910
 a bunch of all sorts of 5 pieces in one this 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.900
 but something not transplanted potted very 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.290
 sour and sluggish went had to plant them 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.989
 early today yesterday 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.269
 there was frost at night 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.030
 I watch a couple and for some reason strawberries in 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:36.579
 In principle, it must be kept very 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:39.329
 well on her very knocked very well 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.470
 But because of the fact that my beds were 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.790
 there was no middle 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.980
 down here is a whip and just a little feather 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:57.080
 charging has become as a boat I think 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:58.990
 bottom is not scary here I planted onions 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.120

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.730
 I wanted to plant eggplant Pepper yesterday 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:21.620
 a landfill that didn't plant otherwise would come 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:29.830

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:33.020

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.500

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:18.200

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:22.700
 also such is logs and filling otherwise 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:28.729
 I have no other way very quickly 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:35.200
 drown so here I grow so 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.200

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.490

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.340
 the number of sawdust ordered let's see what 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.190

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:15.160
