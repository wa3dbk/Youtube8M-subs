00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
do an experiment see how this video

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.050 
do an experiment see how this video
turns<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.560> I'm<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> haul<00:01:14.220> as
