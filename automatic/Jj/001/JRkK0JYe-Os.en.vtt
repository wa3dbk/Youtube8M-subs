up<00:00:20.910> mid<00:00:21.240> October<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.590> i'm<00:00:23.130> guessing

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
up mid October or so and i'm guessing

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.970 
up mid October or so and i'm guessing
the<00:00:23.640> cameras<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.750> gopro<00:00:25.289> hero4<00:00:25.619> will

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the cameras the gopro hero4 will

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.210 
the cameras the gopro hero4 will
probably<00:00:26.550> come<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.510> around<00:00:28.050> March<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
probably come out around March so if you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.759 
probably come out around March so if you
need<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> GoPro<00:00:30.000> before<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.380> would<00:00:31.560> suggest

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
need a GoPro before then I would suggest

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.170 
need a GoPro before then I would suggest
buying<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.640> GoPro<00:00:33.120> Hero<00:00:34.020> 3<00:00:34.140> plus<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.399> black

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
buying the GoPro Hero 3 plus a black

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.020 
buying the GoPro Hero 3 plus a black
edition<00:00:36.800> which<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.309> than<00:00:38.340> enough<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
edition which is more than enough to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
edition which is more than enough to
shoot<00:00:39.239> some<00:00:39.540> amazing<00:00:40.079> footage<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.710> photos

shoot some amazing footage and photos

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
shoot some amazing footage and photos
but<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> wanted<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> run<00:00:42.960> through<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but I wanted to run through some of the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
but I wanted to run through some of the
specs<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> talk<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.660> guys<00:00:45.899> can

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
specs and talk about what you guys can

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.610 
specs and talk about what you guys can
expect<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> GoPro<00:00:47.070> Hero<00:00:47.610> 4<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.260> biggest

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
expect with the GoPro Hero 4 the biggest

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
expect with the GoPro Hero 4 the biggest
thing<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:51.360> opinion<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.379> ability<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
thing in my opinion is the ability to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.069 
thing in my opinion is the ability to
shoot<00:00:54.210> 4k<00:00:55.190> at<00:00:56.190> 30<00:00:56.579> frames<00:00:56.820> per<00:00:57.090> second<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
shoot 4k at 30 frames per second the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.819 
shoot 4k at 30 frames per second the
GoPro<00:00:58.980> Hero<00:00:59.309> 3<00:00:59.370> plus<00:01:00.030> black<00:01:00.359> editions<00:01:00.870> would

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
GoPro Hero 3 plus black editions would

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.060 
GoPro Hero 3 plus black editions would
shoot<00:01:02.100> 4k<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.969> 15<00:01:03.539> frames<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.049> second<00:01:04.470> which

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
shoot 4k and 15 frames a second which

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460 
shoot 4k and 15 frames a second which
isn't<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.850> usable<00:01:06.540> format<00:01:07.049> unless

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
isn't really a usable format unless

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.320 
isn't really a usable format unless
you're<00:01:07.680> trying<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.220> some<00:01:09.060> sort<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you're trying to do some sort of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
you're trying to do some sort of
time-lapse<00:01:09.600> work<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.610> but<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> just

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
time-lapse work with it but you just

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
time-lapse work with it but you just
shoot<00:01:12.150> time-lapse<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:13.080> still<00:01:13.350> images

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
shoot time-lapse with still images

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.140 
shoot time-lapse with still images
anyways<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.000> better

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
anyways if you want to get better

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.249 
anyways if you want to get better
quality<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:17.189> 4k<00:01:17.640> isn't<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.600> usable

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
quality so the 4k isn't really usable

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
quality so the 4k isn't really usable
with<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> GoPro<00:01:20.250> Hero<00:01:20.820> 3<00:01:20.909> plus<00:01:21.659> black

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with the GoPro Hero 3 plus black

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.090 
with the GoPro Hero 3 plus black
editions<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.880> will<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.030> fully<00:01:24.509> usable

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
editions but it will be fully usable

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.999 
editions but it will be fully usable
this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.520> great<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:28.009> doing

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this is going to be great for doing

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.039 
this is going to be great for doing
anything<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.939> drones<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> want<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
get aerial shots in 4k it's going to be

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.770 
get aerial shots in 4k it's going to be
amazing<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> next<00:01:36.360> big

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
screen on the back so you can actually

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
see what you're doing i'm not sure if

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.980 
see what you're doing i'm not sure if
they're<00:02:37.820> going<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> black

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
they're going to have that in the black

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.390 
they're going to have that in the black
edition<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.460> looks<00:02:40.760> as<00:02:41.720> though<00:02:42.530> all<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
edition but it looks as though all the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.460 
edition but it looks as though all the
stats<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.420> Silver<00:02:44.810> Edition<00:02:44.900> are<00:02:45.350> going

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
stats for the Silver Edition are going

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.860 
stats for the Silver Edition are going
to<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.680> about<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.070> same<00:02:46.310> as<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:47.540> 3<00:02:48.470> +<00:02:49.030> 4<00:02:50.030> k<00:02:50.750> at

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
to be about the same as the 3 + 4 k at

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.490 
to be about the same as the 3 + 4 k at
15<00:02:51.230> frames<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.710> second<00:02:52.210> 1080<00:02:53.210> at<00:02:53.540> 60<00:02:54.050> frames<00:02:54.080> a

15 frames a second 1080 at 60 frames a
second<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.160> 720<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.380> 120<00:02:57.380> frames<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.770> second<00:02:58.690> I'm

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
second in 720 at 120 frames a second I'm

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.160 
second in 720 at 120 frames a second I'm
guessing<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.580> hero4<00:03:01.910> black<00:03:02.240> edition<00:03:02.900> is

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
guessing this the hero4 black edition is

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.420 
guessing this the hero4 black edition is
probably<00:03:03.380> going<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.590> be<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.680> lot<00:03:03.860> better<00:03:03.920> for

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
probably going to be a lot better for

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.500 
probably going to be a lot better for
low-light<00:03:04.850> they're<00:03:05.810> probably<00:03:07.240> going<00:03:08.240> to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
low-light they're probably going to

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.770 
low-light they're probably going to
increase<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.590> ISO<00:03:10.130> sensitivity<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.300> they

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
increase the ISO sensitivity and they

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.750 
increase the ISO sensitivity and they
might<00:03:12.080> be<00:03:12.290> releasing<00:03:12.920> some<00:03:13.190> sort<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.550> manual

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
might be releasing some sort of manual

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.690 
might be releasing some sort of manual
control<00:03:14.830> it's<00:03:15.830> kind<00:03:16.100> of<00:03:16.130> all<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.460> in<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> air
