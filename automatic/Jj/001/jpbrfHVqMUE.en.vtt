00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 spades go a little fun today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 on 01net tv with the discovery of two 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.349
 new drones that you may have 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.480
 seen in preview at us it was 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.370
 last january at the crs de las vegas 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.199
 drones that jump that fly that make 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.119
 just about anything and anything and who 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.130
 are signed byrot etc is necessary 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.600
 drones ah ben that's a trick that was 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.279
 ordered with a smartphone it's done 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 to have fun for big kids 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.019
 that we are it is parrot who comes 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 to launch a few weeks ago the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:38.489
 running spyder and the sumo jumping and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 david nogueira tested them and yes who 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.020
 do not know drones from parrot 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.090
 especially the r drone the big toy and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.760
 well look I actually received at 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.500
 lab 01net mini versions both 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 products that make up the mini family 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.969
 drones rolling spyder and jumping 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.170
 sumo we are all going to be interested in 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.149
 first products 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.920
 the mini quadcopter which can 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.920
 fly but also ride on the ceiling 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.240
 the rolling spyder whose camille 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.100
 quadricopter which is still 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.659
 equipped with fairly important technologies 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.440
 at parrot since there is always and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.600
 well this censor that allows drones to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.770
 stabilize perfectly when it is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.420
 about one meter tall is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.680
 so this one will allow you to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.600
 stabilize the device is to make you 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.119
 more easily hand with 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.440
 the application freeflight 3 novelty 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.810
 is that it's this accessory in 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.580
 plastic these are actually wheels that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 come directly to one another 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.290
 axis that can then be classified on the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.539
 quadricopter the asset of this device 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.550
 is that it also protects the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.800
 drone when it falls violently on the ground 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.179
 since killers an object is indeed the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.950
 big of this mast safe and they 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.259
 fall learning spyder connects 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.940
 then in bluetooth with any 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.130
 smartphone ios or android 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.630
 but we prefer to warn you all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.580
 even the application under android on it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.830
 find range more capricious than the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.990
 ios version we could note more than 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.420
 crashes and also to a responsiveness that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.319
 is not as effective as on the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.880
 ios platform 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.619
 which is great and good is that it 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.990
 drone pilots really easily 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.340
 from the smartphone app 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 finds the virtual joystick screen 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.900
 that allow to mount or 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.489
 get off the drone and the accelerometer from 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.750
 smartphone will meanwhile for the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.370
 move back and forth 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.170
 the originality of rolling spyder is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.879
 so to ride on the ceiling is pretty much 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.629
 near the most complicated exercise to 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.250
 enforce 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.720
 we will still acquire some 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.440
 a helping hand but still includes 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 fast enough 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.910
 finally last originality of the rolling 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.379
 spyder is the camera that is under 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.150
 the device that will allow you in fact 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.250
 to make girl scenes view from above 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.720
 so in fact drones is the quality 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.280
 of image is really any but 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 saab will give small clichÃ©s fun 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.720
 to share on social networks 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 the other model the sumo jumping which is 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.460
 this time a robot a little stunt 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.350
 since it is equipped at the back of a 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.420
 cylinder system that actually allows him 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.580
 to jump about 80 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.340
 centimeters forward or roughly 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.050
 80 cm in height again 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.880
 the freeflight application allows to 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.430
 pilot the object really easily 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.250
 with always these same problems between 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.600
 ios and android platforms is the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.490
 particularity of this robot is well it's 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.200
 that he has a camera here in front that 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.550
 actually allows to film the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.140
 moves that can be made with the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.490
 robot and especially to surprise in fact 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.900
 his colleagues by making them a little 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.700
 jump on the yellows story to impress a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.920
 little parrot gallery integrates 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.390
 animations directly programmed into the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.160
 robot that is active from the application 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.410
 we will actually find an effect of 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.030
 metronome a pendulum system and a 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.860
 animation a little bit more fun that 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.540
 is the jumping top since the robot 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.610
 actually going not turned as a 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.990
 top then jump a good point for this 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.580
 mini stunt drones is fine this is 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.650
 that it is robust since we could 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.290
 drop likewise from the height of a 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.510
 table and at no point did he follow 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 breaks there are wheels that dampen 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.290
 very well the shocks 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.330
 these two drones, however, have a huge 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.310
 problem is that the batteries 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.620
 integrated and well offers autonomy 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.720
 really ridiculous ten minutes 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.190
 in both cases so it's good too 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.650
 little as the batteries get 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.660
 recharge from micro sd ports that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.069
 are on the robots so it will take 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.150
 obligatorily and well let them 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.890
 connect either a plug or a pc this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.090
 who finally mobilizes the robot a 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.859
 last criticism all the harder to 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.660
 accept that these mini drones are everything 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.030
 likewise quite a hundred euros 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.889
 for the rolling spyder and 160 euros for 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.240
 the sumo jumping at this price level on 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.260
 expect at least to have a second 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.260
 battery and a charger 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.020
 these two mini drones are gadgets 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.639
 since actually if it works 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.650
 really good if we can really 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.389
 having fun with if you are a 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.669
 little bit passionate about drones and 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.350
 well the low autonomy of these products 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.450
 make it necessary to renew constantly 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.160
 recharge cycles 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.840
 so in the end we have fun 10 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.340
 minutes and then we tidy and then 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.080
 finally ben is likely that 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.740
 it's found in a corner of an office 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.740
 then in a drawer
