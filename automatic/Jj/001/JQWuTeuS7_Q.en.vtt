Welcome in the "Canal CÃ³mo Se Hace"

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.240
let's prepare homemade marshmallows.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340
1 sachet of flavored gelatin

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
1 envelope of neutral gelatine 20 gr

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
200 gr of water

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.880
200 gr of sugar

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.880
Icing sugar

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:57.680
To start in a small pot we put half the water, add the neutral gelatin and sugar.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.960
We will put it on the fire and we will remove it constantly.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:31.400
In a separate bowl we throw the rest of the water that we had reserved, we will put the flavor jelly envelope moving constantly until it dissolves.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.460
Now we will pour it in the pot that we had in the fire, always stirring it so that it does not stick to us and we will let it cook over a low heat.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:51.860
Now it's time to move to the mixer, beat until it has a texture like snow point.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:53.000
Now it's time to pass it to a pastry bag. Then we take a tray and put a veggie paper, important; on it we sifted icing sugar, so they will not stick

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.040
It is time to make our jelly churros, once made, we sift more icing sugar over

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.660
They are ready to consume.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.320
