 Hello dear friends Swami tanks and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.199
 this is a new series memen tank today we 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.269
 Consider a penetration bug. 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.910
 these are the blocks that occupy 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.520
 only part of the whole block that is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 here are the fences and glass panel 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 even in our case, and each actually 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 running mind starbuck just sit in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.010
 the trolley and and we press I went out to go out 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 from it and in the end we find ourselves 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 the other side of the wall and this bug 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:53.560
 works naturally but no one 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.540
 ideal breeding bug avoids all 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.530
 we can helpless creatures helpless 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.450
 so there is no bug which 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.310
 would have worked completely perfect then they 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.800
 and Gods, God, where are you all drawn from? 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.720
 each bug has its own 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.030
 flaws and this bug 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.760
 he is the only one that this bug works 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.560
 just to one side of the world just 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.660
 we sit in for example a light which 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.190
 directed the other side we press shift at 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.530
 throws us anyway this way 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.300
 that is, constantly throwing us out 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.940
 trolleys in one direction only 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.430
 This bug and this bug are based on this 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.760
 also works well on gray let's 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.380
 make sure in the movie that it will be so 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.690
 this bug only works on one side 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.640
 light works on servers so 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.979
 I hope it will be useful to you if 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.869
 Anyone want to make a house for themselves 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.150
 full glass panels and 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.770
 any kind of fence then be 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.619
 caution coils you can get 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.869
 other players from go into anything 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.000
 possible and on this I think you can 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.790
 finish with you was soldering to all 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.570
