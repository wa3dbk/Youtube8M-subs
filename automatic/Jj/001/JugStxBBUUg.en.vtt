verizon<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.250> sprint<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.789> let's<00:00:17.940> pick<00:00:18.090> down

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
verizon and sprint so let's pick down

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150 
verizon and sprint so let's pick down
but<00:00:18.510> all<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.779> gsm<00:00:19.260> sets<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.590> big<00:00:19.740> thumbs<00:00:19.980> up

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
but all you gsm sets a big thumbs up

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.509 
but all you gsm sets a big thumbs up
like<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> way<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.949> thing<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.490> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
like me so I the way one thing that is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
like me so I the way one thing that is
the<00:00:23.880> most<00:00:24.090> noticeable<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.320> why<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.769> would

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the most noticeable and why you would

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.250 
the most noticeable and why you would
download<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.869> because<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.990> comes<00:00:28.140> with

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
download this is because it comes with

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.040 
download this is because it comes with
franco.kernel<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.099> comes<00:00:29.250> built<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> I'll

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
franco.kernel it comes built in so I'll

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
franco.kernel it comes built in so I'll
spin<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.560> bit<00:00:31.830> more<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.099> bit

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
spin a little bit more a little bit

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639 
spin a little bit more a little bit
right<00:00:32.910> away<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> camera<00:00:33.809> online<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
right away you got the camera online and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.700 
right away you got the camera online and
Google<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.430> any<00:00:36.149> other<00:00:36.480> rom<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.050> sacre

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
Google not like any other rom and sacre

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
Google not like any other rom and sacre
once<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.239> looks<00:00:39.450> pretty<00:00:39.690> normal

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
once you get in it looks pretty normal

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.110 
once you get in it looks pretty normal
which<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> there's<00:00:41.340> nothing<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:41.820> fancy

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
which it is there's nothing really fancy

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000 
which it is there's nothing really fancy
about<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> don't<00:00:43.920> got

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
about this as you can see you don't got

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
about this as you can see you don't got
a<00:00:44.040> 14<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.640> toggle<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> forward<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a 14 with your toggle or the forward to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
a 14 with your toggle or the forward to
talk<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> my<00:00:46.110> bed<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.579> everything<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:48.180> pretty

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
talk on my bed and everything is pretty

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.229 
talk on my bed and everything is pretty
stock<00:00:48.870> um<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.219> only<00:00:50.250> big<00:00:50.610> difference<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
stock um the only big difference is the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
stock um the only big difference is the
franco.kernel<00:00:52.250> surely<00:00:53.250> let's<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> look

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
franco.kernel surely let's take a look

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250 
franco.kernel surely let's take a look
at<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.480> actually<00:00:54.690> installed<00:00:55.170> with

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
at it's actually installed with

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
at it's actually installed with
franco.kernel<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.300> there

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
franco.kernel as you can see right there

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
franco.kernel as you can see right there
you<00:00:57.719> got<00:00:57.870> 4.1<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> franco.kernel<00:00:59.460> right

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you got 4.1 and franco.kernel right

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
you got 4.1 and franco.kernel right
there<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.840> build<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> version<00:01:01.649> 3<00:01:01.980> if

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there and the build is version 3 if

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
there and the build is version 3 if
you're<00:01:02.219> wondering<00:01:02.430> about<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.059> too<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> one

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you're wondering about that too so one

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
you're wondering about that too so one
major<00:01:05.430> difference<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.150> gonna<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
major difference is gonna be the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.719 
major difference is gonna be the
franco.kernel<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.409> makes<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.010> phone<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
franco.kernel which makes this phone and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
franco.kernel which makes this phone and
performance<00:01:09.570> much<00:01:09.840> faster<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.010> can't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
performance much faster now i can't

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
performance much faster now i can't
really<00:01:11.520> show<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> only<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> quadrant

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really show you only with the quadrant

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
really show you only with the quadrant
scores<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:13.380> i<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> bit<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
scores which i will get to bit get to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
scores which i will get to bit get to
there<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.189> only<00:01:17.400> thing

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there in a little bit but the only thing

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
there in a little bit but the only thing
that<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.150> notice<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that you can actually notice is that it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
that you can actually notice is that it
is<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.439> smooth<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.040> fast<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.790> sleep

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
is really smooth really fast and sleep

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
is really smooth really fast and sleep
now<00:01:21.479> jelly<00:01:22.080> bean<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.439> already<00:01:22.890> made<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> fast

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
now jelly bean have already made it fast

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.890 
now jelly bean have already made it fast
and<00:01:23.729> sleep<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.479> notice<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.780> little

and sleep but you can notice a little
bit<00:01:25.049> faster<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.710> sleeper<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
bit faster and sleeper because of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
bit faster and sleeper because of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
me this is just pure straight of them

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.340 
me this is just pure straight of them
it's<00:01:55.530> straight<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:55.920> installing<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.350> salty

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
it's straight out installing it salty

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.660 
it's straight out installing it salty
back<00:01:58.530> once<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.950> done

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
back once it's done

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.640 
back once it's done
alright<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:01.880> complete<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:03.080> let's<00:02:03.380> take<00:02:03.620> a

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
alright it's complete so let's take a

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.120 
alright it's complete so let's take a
look<00:02:03.860> at<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:06.170> your<00:02:06.320> device<00:02:06.620> all<00:02:06.890> right

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
look at it so your device all right

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.880 
look at it so your device all right
that's<00:02:07.310> that's<00:02:07.610> pretty<00:02:07.790> good<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:09.050> divides<00:02:09.680> in

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
that's that's pretty good it divides in

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.860 
that's that's pretty good it divides in
third<00:02:10.070> place<00:02:11.020> 2865<00:02:12.880> give<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> few<00:02:14.510> seconds

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
third place 2865 give that a few seconds

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.340 
third place 2865 give that a few seconds
and<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.980> can<00:02:16.190> probably<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.720> little<00:02:18.080> bit

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and you can probably see it a little bit

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.480 
and you can probably see it a little bit
but<00:02:18.890> score<00:02:19.930> 2865<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.100> not<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> bad

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
but score 2865 so that is not a bad

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.910 
but score 2865 so that is not a bad
score<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.690> bet<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.470> you'd<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
score and I bet you if you'd have the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.680 
score and I bet you if you'd have the
franco.kernel<00:02:25.250> it'd<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.940> much<00:02:26.210> slower<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
franco.kernel it'd be much slower to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.660 
franco.kernel it'd be much slower to
probably<00:02:26.930> be<00:02:27.110> around<00:02:27.350> here<00:02:27.800> but<00:02:28.490> it's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
probably be around here but it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.030 
probably be around here but it's
actually<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.090> third<00:02:29.240> place<00:02:29.590> two<00:02:30.590> down<00:02:30.800> from

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
actually in third place two down from

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.130 
actually in third place two down from
HTC<00:02:31.520> One<00:02:31.790> X<00:02:31.910> which<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.240> in<00:02:32.420> first<00:02:32.630> place<00:02:32.780> is

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
HTC One X which is in first place is

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.140 
HTC One X which is in first place is
Tran<00:02:33.320> asu's<00:02:33.830> transformers<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> second<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
Tran asu's transformers in a second and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.930 
Tran asu's transformers in a second and
then<00:02:35.180> our<00:02:35.540> device<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.350> third<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.700> that's<00:02:37.850> a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
then our device is on third so that's a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.400 
then our device is on third so that's a
great<00:02:38.060> score<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.630> would<00:02:38.780> highly<00:02:39.020> recommend<00:02:39.050> you

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
show you any of the features because it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520 
show you any of the features because it
is<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.880> basically<00:02:44.420> stock<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
is just basically stock with the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.280 
is just basically stock with the
franco.kernel<00:02:45.920> did<00:02:46.400> built<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.110> a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
franco.kernel did built in but it's a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.810 
franco.kernel did built in but it's a
must-have<00:02:48.650> for<00:02:48.770> any<00:02:49.070> type<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.340> person<00:02:49.790> who

like saving battery and a person who
likes<00:02:51.500> performance<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.060> recommend<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.810> get
