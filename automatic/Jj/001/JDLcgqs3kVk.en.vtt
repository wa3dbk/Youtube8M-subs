Harbor Freight right after I bought this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
Harbor Freight right after I bought this

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
one but it's all good though because the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.180 
one but it's all good though because the
one<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.480> Harbor<00:00:48.989> Freight<00:00:49.020> doesn't<00:00:49.860> come<00:00:50.039> with

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
one at Harbor Freight doesn't come with

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
one at Harbor Freight doesn't come with
the<00:00:50.280> key<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> key<00:00:51.270> coat<00:00:51.510> comes<00:00:51.780> out

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the key so this is a key coat comes out

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
the key so this is a key coat comes out
take<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.510> put<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.750> back<00:00:54.870> in

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
take it out and you can put it back in

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
take it out and you can put it back in
so<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> Harbor<00:00:56.280> Freight<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.609> just<00:00:56.730> going

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so when a Harbor Freight is just going

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
so when a Harbor Freight is just going
to<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.480> off<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.199> take

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to turn on and off you can actually take

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250 
to turn on and off you can actually take
it<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.520> that's<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> plus<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.079> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it out so that's kind of plus I can just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.619 
it out so that's kind of plus I can just
take<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.859> take<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.370> me<00:01:02.629> if

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
take this out and take it with me if

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
take this out and take it with me if
I'll<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.289> car<00:01:04.470> we'll<00:01:04.649> have<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.990 
know of course go up onto the hood and
take<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> off<00:01:08.039> but<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.759> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.940> put

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
take it off but because I'm going to put

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.389 
take it off but because I'm going to put
mine<00:01:09.300> under<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> hood<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.069> this<00:01:11.069> is<00:01:11.190> how<00:01:11.340> I'm

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
mine under the hood and this is how I'm

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.940 
mine under the hood and this is how I'm
going<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.759> it<00:01:11.910> have<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.149> hot<00:01:12.390> water

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
going to do it have this hot water

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.020 
going to do it have this hot water
so<00:01:13.950> one's<00:01:14.940> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.459> the<00:01:17.459> negative

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so one's going to go to the negative

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.029 
so one's going to go to the negative
terminal<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> battery<00:01:18.569> and<00:01:19.170> one's<00:01:19.800> going

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
terminal on the battery and one's going

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.460 
terminal on the battery and one's going
to<00:01:20.069> go<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:23.149> ground<00:01:24.149> so<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.410> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
to go to the ground so I'm going to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.199 
to go to the ground so I'm going to
mount<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.800> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> firewall<00:01:26.490> probably<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
mount it on the firewall probably so

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.499 
mount it on the firewall probably so
these<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.720> some<00:01:28.050> little<00:01:28.349> long<00:01:29.420> brackets<00:01:30.420> I
