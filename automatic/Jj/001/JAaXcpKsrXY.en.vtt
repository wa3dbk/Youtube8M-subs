soul grows in there so you basically

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.170 
soul grows in there so you basically
just<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.220> gotta<00:01:23.369> feed<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> i<00:01:23.880> believe

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
just do this you gotta feed it i believe

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.800 
just do this you gotta feed it i believe
it's<00:01:24.360> 25<00:01:24.780> souls<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.299> you<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.630> gets

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's 25 souls here and you know it gets

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.999 
it's 25 souls here and you know it gets
a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.110> sketchy<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> couple<00:01:28.860> times

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
a little sketchy here a couple times

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649 
a little sketchy here a couple times
you're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.610> through<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.880> few<00:01:30.090> shields

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you're going to go through a few shields

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
you're going to go through a few shields
and<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:30.960> why<00:01:31.140> i<00:01:31.170> say<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.710> might<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> good

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and that's why i say it might be a good

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760 
and that's why i say it might be a good
idea<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.700> yourself<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:34.110> some<00:01:34.530> type

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
idea to have yourself you know some type

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.940 
idea to have yourself you know some type
of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.700> staff<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.200> back<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.740> but

of a staff or what not is back up but

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.200 
of a staff or what not is back up but
it's<00:01:38.070> also<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> early<00:01:39.030> rounds

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's also going to be the early rounds

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.870 
it's also going to be the early rounds
you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.500> sometimes<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.610> you

them all out i believe up to like the
40s<00:06:23.620> or<00:06:23.740> 50s<00:06:23.950> but<00:06:24.700> even<00:06:25.030> still<00:06:25.180> it's<00:06:25.650> better

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
40s or 50s but even still it's better

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.610

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
than monkeys because instantaneous and

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.370 
than monkeys because instantaneous and
it<00:06:29.860> pulls<00:06:30.130> them<00:06:30.340> away<00:06:30.610> from<00:06:30.670> you<00:06:31.060> when<00:06:31.960> you

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
it pulls them away from you when you

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.810 
it pulls them away from you when you
know<00:06:32.680> versus<00:06:33.250> waiting<00:06:33.730> ten<00:06:34.090> seconds
