00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.390 
poaching liquid and in cooking school
and<00:01:40.060> when<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.870> worked<00:01:41.110> in<00:01:41.230> restaurants<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:42.190> used

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
and when I worked in restaurants we used

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.640 
and when I worked in restaurants we used
a<00:01:42.610> lot<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.090> poaching<00:01:43.990> liquids<00:01:44.260> who<00:01:44.320> made<00:01:44.500> all

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
a lot of poaching liquids who made all

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.930 
a lot of poaching liquids who made all
different<00:01:45.100> ones<00:01:45.160> but<00:01:45.370> this<00:01:45.490> was<00:01:45.670> one<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.820> my

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
different ones but this was one of my

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.760 
different ones but this was one of my
favorites<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.830> take<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.910> vanilla<00:01:49.180> bean<00:01:49.390> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
favorites so I take the vanilla bean and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.410 
favorites so I take the vanilla bean and
I<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:51.400> cut<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:53.320> half<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.060> seeds

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
I just cut it in half just so the seeds

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.840 
I just cut it in half just so the seeds
from<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.720> inside<00:01:56.320> can<00:01:57.010> come<00:01:57.250> off<00:01:57.400> into<00:01:57.760> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
from the inside can come off into the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.840 
from the inside can come off into the
poaching<00:01:58.030> liquid<00:01:58.470> just<00:01:59.470> like<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.980> so<00:02:00.520> as<00:02:00.670> it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
poaching liquid just like that so as it

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.000 
poaching liquid just like that so as it
simmers<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.450> slowly<00:02:01.990> fuses<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.890> there<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:05.010> for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
simmers it slowly fuses in there and for

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.370
