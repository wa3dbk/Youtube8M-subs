it's about four times faster than a

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.469 
it's about four times faster than a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.630 

it<00:05:53.320> takes<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.590> lot<00:05:53.710> of<00:05:53.770> strength<00:05:54.130> and<00:05:54.310> power<00:05:54.400> to

the feet will actually double I think

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.240 
the feet will actually double I think
