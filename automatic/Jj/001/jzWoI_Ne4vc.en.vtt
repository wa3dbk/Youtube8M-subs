00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.550 
triple layer fence that's like going
around<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.790> which<00:01:34.570> makes<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.899> so<00:01:35.079> good<00:01:35.229> against

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
around it which makes it so good against

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.170 
around it which makes it so good against
walkers<00:01:35.979> because<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.579> know<00:01:36.670> even<00:01:36.909> with

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
walkers because you know even with

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.240 
walkers because you know even with
walkers<00:01:37.630> can<00:01:37.810> get<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.200> outer<00:01:38.829> layer<00:01:39.219> of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
walkers can get to the outer layer of

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.340 
walkers can get to the outer layer of
the<00:01:39.399> fence<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:40.420> know<00:01:40.450> you've<00:01:40.689> still<00:01:40.960> got<00:01:41.140> like

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the fence you know you've still got like

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.760 
the fence you know you've still got like
another<00:01:41.649> layer<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:43.329> go<00:01:43.570> before<00:01:44.409> they<00:01:44.680> can

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
another layer to to go before they can

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.990 
another layer to to go before they can
get<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.039> you<00:01:45.189> and<00:01:45.399> then<00:01:45.490> you're<00:01:45.670> inside<00:01:45.969> a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
get to you and then you're inside a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.969 
get to you and then you're inside a
building<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.350> building's

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
building so you have a building's

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.620 
building so you have a building's
protection<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:48.759> then<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.969> have<00:01:49.119> one<00:01:49.420> layer

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
protection and then you have one layer

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.020 
protection and then you have one layer
of<00:01:49.869> Defense<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.619> have<00:01:50.770> lookout<00:01:51.280> towers<00:01:51.670> you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
of Defense you have lookout towers you

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.340 
of Defense you have lookout towers you
have<00:01:52.149> another<00:01:52.420> one<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.750> then<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.990> might<00:01:53.140> even

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
have another one and then you might even

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.550 
have another one and then you might even
have<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.560> third<00:01:53.859> in<00:01:54.039> some<00:01:54.250> spots<00:01:54.549> so<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:56.530> just

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
have a third in some spots so it just

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.410 
have a third in some spots so it just
really<00:01:56.950> looks<00:01:56.979> cool<00:01:57.340> feel<00:01:57.969> free<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.240> check<00:01:58.359> out
