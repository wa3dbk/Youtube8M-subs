00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.069
 also become aware 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.450
 both who are traveling through the 45 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.890
 decrease the speed with which you are 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.670
 crossing to pay more attention

 and has a little more attentive than in the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.780
 local because the flow and see what is 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.030

 You who travel 4 to 5 have to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.260
 slow down 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.390
 if you are seeing that you have crosses 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 have many intersections throughout the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.769
 extension 45 will already looking far 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.989

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.959
 speed is there because I 'm here in the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.670

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.540
 driver inattentive and will cross and 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.820

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.250

 56 years old josÃ© ferreira da silva 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.870
 was attentive when crossing the 45 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.880
 why not take a look just the side 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.980
 right when it was crossed 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.400

 I've done dozens of serious accidents by 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.150
 when a person dies two and three 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.790
 people are still dying because what 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.590
 lack of attention 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.700
 the pointer driver because he 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.570
 crossed the highway 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.120
 inadvertent and paid for the error with 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.859
 own life unfortunately is unfortunately 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.570
 a parent of a hard working family 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.010
