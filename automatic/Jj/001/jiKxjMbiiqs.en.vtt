on record on the laptop mic but first I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.299 
on record on the laptop mic but first I
start<00:00:42.870> off<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:45.710> out<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> mix<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
start off with a out with a mix of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.709 
start off with a out with a mix of
traits<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.450> mixer<00:00:50.180> which<00:00:51.180> attracts

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
traits that I'm a mixer which attracts

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.119 
traits that I'm a mixer which attracts
thing<00:00:51.989> um<00:00:53.420> have<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> microphone<00:00:55.129> basically

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
thing um have a microphone basically

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
thing um have a microphone basically
that's<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> presets<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that's the presets I have for that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
that's the presets I have for that
specific<00:00:58.230> channel<00:00:58.620> um<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> microphone

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
specific channel um for the microphone

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.560 
specific channel um for the microphone
so<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> brings<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.440> compressor<00:01:02.570> compressor

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so it brings up a compressor compressor

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.039 
so it brings up a compressor compressor
a<00:01:04.040> spit<00:01:05.040> fish<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:06.240> she<00:01:06.360> basically<00:01:06.689> pulls

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
a spit fish when she basically pulls

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:07.910 
a spit fish when she basically pulls
that<00:01:07.260> sound

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that sound

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
that sound

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you would do it dude go over here um as

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.120 
you would do it dude go over here um as
you<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.579> audio<00:01:48.000> input<00:01:48.360> source<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.979> then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you see this audio input source and then

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
you see this audio input source and then
you<00:01:50.159> click<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.210> click<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you click that and then just click the

you click that and then just click the
mic<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.579> also<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.729> Edison<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.390> will<00:01:54.869> turn<00:01:55.110> off<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
mic and also in Edison I will turn off I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.399 
mic and also in Edison I will turn off I
would<00:01:55.860> output<00:01:56.340> turn<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.509> new<00:01:57.899> input

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
would output turn on actually new input

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.310 
would output turn on actually new input
and<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.329> person<00:02:00.659> doesn't<00:02:01.020> hear

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and that's so the person doesn't hear

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.149 
and that's so the person doesn't hear
themselves<00:02:01.530> while<00:02:01.920> they're<00:02:02.040> speaking

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
themselves while they're speaking

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850 
themselves while they're speaking
because<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:03.540> automatically<00:02:04.110> comes<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.590> as

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
because it automatically comes up as

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.719 
because it automatically comes up as
them<00:02:05.520> hearing<00:02:06.060> themselves<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.610> we'll

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
them hearing themselves and what we'll

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
them hearing themselves and what we'll
have<00:02:08.849> talk<00:02:09.060> mic<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> laptop<00:02:09.959> mic<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.649> going

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
have talk mic with a laptop mic is going

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.520 
have talk mic with a laptop mic is going
to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.979> delayed<00:02:11.310> um<00:02:11.930> even<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.470> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to be delayed um even if you have it I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
to be delayed um even if you have it I
do<00:02:13.590> Lois<00:02:13.920> Lane<00:02:14.220> even<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.569> at<00:02:15.690> you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
do Lois Lane even if you have it at you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.440 
do Lois Lane even if you have it at you
low<00:02:15.959> latency<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.940> still<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> be

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
low latency it's still going to be
