00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.019
 greetings guardians we bring you more than 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.360
 words in the comparison of souls more 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.759
 concretely two the last word and the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 decree a priori the word 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 may seem disproportionate to the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
 exotic character of the last word 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.960
 but we will soon see that the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 appearances cheat we start with the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.820
 comparative these the first two 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680
 they offer a damage of 331 where the word 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 decree comes out winning with its damage 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.730
 empty added apart this does not occupy square 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.019
 of exotic however the other yes 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 decline and impact both are 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.180
 tied with 32 and 68 points 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.519
 respectively the reach the word 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.100
 wins with 25 points against 14 of the 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.070
 last word 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.410
 in stability the exotic wins with 81 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.870
 points compared to 45 of those described 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.289
 to finish we go with the recharge where 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.000
 is the last word in the head with 56 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.190
 points against 45 of their 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.199
 competitors in the charger wins the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 decree word with 12 rounds versus 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.759
 the 8th of the last word 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.469
 let's talk about your main skills 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.210
 the last word comes with bonus 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.680
 of damage and stability and damage of 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.130
 extra accuracy when shooting from the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.079
 hip with an extra bonus and the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.340
 most interesting of all is the shot 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.920
 automatic 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.200
 the word decrees gives us to accept three 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.750
 precision shots that will return us a 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
 bullet to the charger by causing damage with this 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.890
 Weapon its stability increases and ammo 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.010
 explosive that causes extra damage in another 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.410
 the shocking area 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.510
 a priori and in my opinion these weapons 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.250
 for the pv are not bad but where 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.170
 they demonstrate their true potential is in 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.880
 the crucible while with the last 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.980
 word you get attack speed and 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.930
 more mobility with the word of cut 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.760
 we will have more precision and power 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.290
 fire will depend on our styles 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.150
 of the game to choose between one and another 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.130
 I leave you a couple of minutes of king play 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.170
 so that you dance different ways of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.760
 play with them that I have so 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.770
 thanks for watching the blake video and 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.870

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.260
 has liked and as we always see in the 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.260
 border 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.300
 perform but friend has the area 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.100
 area b is captured 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.150
 neutralized zone 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.000
 arrives at heavy ammunition 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.870
 neutralized 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 Safe area c ammunition on the way 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.550
 with heavy ammunition available 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.450
 show what is worth is guardian 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.639
 in front of this defeat 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.639
 only the strong survive 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.719
 plus 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.550
 and
