 deviate from the degree raised much to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.530
 channel I'm a little fed up of recording with 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.590
 which imminent if I do not say that always 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 is the fate that these last days is going 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.670
 a little guided because of what he does 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 little that they have renewed it or that is what 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.690
 have updated and such and we already have 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.280
 sword town success 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.899
 go up if you're here you can not go up like this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.899
 that we go here 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.340
 and not much more, I hope you liked the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.650
 video because I do not know it's interesting to see 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.040
 as someone for toxo as I die not 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.840
 it's funny it's fun and someone 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.020
 curious as I do not find a single 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.660
 chest that's also fun to watch 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.569
 how to find a chest not to the house 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.250
 gigantic skis tronchante not in 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.819
 series tronchante so we're going 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.080
 down if there's nothing then we're leaving 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.659
 a chest has touched us the chest in rich 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.610
 rich 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:32.120
 if I have iron so she but with 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.470
 our sword of this I hope that what 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.620
 has died luisito because if I do not 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.030
 I'm not scammed and I do not like that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.110
 nothing there is louisito visited good here 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.590
 little friend 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.590
 and here is our friend who is not 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.180
 well we are going to put it 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.130
 oh my god I had a diamond in guys 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.410
 I do not know if you see me but I'm already 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.600
 fully equipped I do not know about you 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.370
 but I think it's going to be pretty good 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.040
 this game and we have a diamond I do not know 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.640
 I do not know then what this game is going to 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.430
 get out quite well the challenge would be to get 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.500
 at the same time more than that is when I like it 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.030
 get to the des marchÃ©s even if he dies 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.350
 but at least yes that within the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.050
 last and that flatters me I like me 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.940
 like and I like it and I'm going through 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.709
 rooms where there are two doors and 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.660
 I'm going in and out that's from 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.900
 clever kid ready boy 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.520
 and nothing here we are going to be doing 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.540
 jumps like that to go faster 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.030
 and here you can go up more to see if there 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.610
 something up here and if not then we 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.330
 we are dying many people there in 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.370
 chest I was going to go without inspecting and 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.650
 would make a chest worth food that's what 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.350
 we need perfect vale 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.980
 and we 're going to go all the way 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.909
 when going out let's see 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.909
 over here 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.930
 now here a chest 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.690
 but that is really nothing over here 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.660
 neither and here there is an exit so we 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.350
 we're going to go because uh what output of what 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.020
 fuck this is a suicide 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.819
 that nothing around here either 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.720
 I am not a case seen and vacuum 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.770
 here already more seen to the emptiness and we go away 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.639
 and we have already finished registering 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.400
 this house shredded super cool and we 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.919
 let's go because yes, but not 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.659
 we have retired are you I do not know I want 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.750
 originate it all because in the end 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:50.560
 Sometimes I leave and I leave things chests 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.770
 I do not want to leave 6 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.350
 I suppose you understand and that's it 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.240
 correct auto I just got a little bit 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.270
 bad because the region had nothing but 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.210
 I come 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.050
 let's put the food around here for 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.840
 here and for 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.460
 and it does not matter and we have it let's start 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.990
 to eat because if we do not die of 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.280
 hungry and this in my plans 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.490
 I think I 'm going to poison myself with this 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.020
 Well, we are not going down 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:24.900
 We are already full equip HD so it is already 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:29.990
 Board I hope not better 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.490
 they gave us success my death community 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.199
 it comes but 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.630
 killed me has killed me not this is the 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.400
 greatest fil they can do as I 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.550
 they could kill if they give it first if 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.210
 he's wearing jerry mail and up 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.340
 with gold my god 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.190
 the biggest fail in the hunger games ' 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.930
 that I have had, I suppose there will be 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.930
 had more but be 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.860
 or to water farc is that the truth is not 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.659
 I understand nothing that has just happened or 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.190
 be I was so happy and I give from behind 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:11.220
 knowing that I was going to kill him and put me 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.229
 I do not know what you think if it is 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.259
 a howitzer like a house or I do not know what it is 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.979
 but I hope it's been this 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:22.080
 mini video mini fail or maxi fail like 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.180
 want to call and see you next 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.039
 which I hope is a better game than 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.860
 this is because it's not that I have left very 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:32.860
 alright so we've killed some I do not know what 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.340

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.900

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.850
 because it kills me the second one that I find 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.590

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.120
 because what's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.700
 wrong now I would have touched against this 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.490
