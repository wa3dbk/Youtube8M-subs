drop them because sometimes they'll
break<00:02:15.739> their<00:02:15.950> legs<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.459> they<00:02:16.519> turn<00:02:16.730> red<00:02:16.760> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
break their legs and they turn red and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.650 
break their legs and they turn red and
that's<00:02:17.330> not<00:02:17.570> going<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:17.870> good<00:02:18.110> for<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:19.660> as

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that's not going to be good for you as

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.120 
that's not going to be good for you as
you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.900> see<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.290> physics<00:02:21.620> gets<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.950> little

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
you can see that physics gets a little

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.009 
you can see that physics gets a little
bit<00:02:22.489> different<00:02:22.940> as<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.180> go<00:02:23.330> up<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.660> levels

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
bit different as you go up in levels

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.229 
bit different as you go up in levels
