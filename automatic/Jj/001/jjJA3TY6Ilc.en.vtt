small charger and then we have the

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:38.540 
small charger and then we have the
little<00:01:31.110> quadcopter<00:01:35.869> now<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.929> booms<00:01:37.830> with<00:01:38.399> the

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
little quadcopter now the booms with the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.529 
little quadcopter now the booms with the
rotors<00:01:40.459> are<00:01:41.459> taped<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> bottom<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
rotors are taped to the bottom of the

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:56.570 
rotors are taped to the bottom of the
package

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.830 

therefore<00:01:57.580> those<00:01:57.880> two<00:01:58.450> white<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.930> orange<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
therefore those two white to orange the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.080 
therefore those two white to orange the
only<00:02:05.140> thing<00:02:05.320> left<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.800> box<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.790> user's

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
only thing left in the box is the user's

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.470 
only thing left in the box is the user's
manual<00:02:09.869> which<00:02:10.869> they<00:02:11.080> include<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.890> DVD<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
manual which they include a DVD for the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.450 
manual which they include a DVD for the
user's<00:02:13.810> manual<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.930> quick<00:02:16.930> guide<00:02:17.170> for

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
user's manual and a quick guide for

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:33.240 
user's manual and a quick guide for
assembly<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.050> looks<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.530> booms<00:02:32.770> just

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
assembly so it looks like the booms just

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:51.330 
assembly so it looks like the booms just
snap<00:02:33.580> in

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.520 

it'll<00:02:52.340> be<00:02:52.459> mindful<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.870> rotation<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.440> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
it'll be mindful of the rotation of the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.850 
it'll be mindful of the rotation of the
props<00:02:54.800> when<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.130> put<00:02:55.310> them<00:02:55.400> in

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.620 

so<00:03:03.860> first<00:03:04.100> we'll<00:03:04.280> look<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:04.610> binding<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.300> Devo

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
so first we'll look at binding the Devo

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.650 
so first we'll look at binding the Devo
for<00:03:05.989> with<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.350> quadcopter<00:03:07.239> turn<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.480> wait

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
for with the quadcopter turn it on wait

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.100 
for with the quadcopter turn it on wait
for<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.959> beep<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:11.450> plug<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.870> your

we go into settings on our eye device
find<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.810> network<00:03:48.170> we're<00:03:48.380> looking<00:03:48.620> for<00:03:48.799> which

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
find the network we're looking for which

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.100 
find the network we're looking for which
is<00:03:49.010> wk<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:50.090> then<00:03:50.209> it<00:03:50.329> has<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.450> number<00:03:52.900> ok<00:03:53.900> now

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
is wk and then it has a number ok now

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.900 
is wk and then it has a number ok now
that<00:03:54.140> it's<00:03:54.440> connected<00:03:54.950> we<00:03:55.130> can<00:03:55.160> go<00:03:55.430> find<00:03:55.730> our

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
that it's connected we can go find our

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.479 
that it's connected we can go find our
wk<00:03:56.570> remote<00:03:56.959> program<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.650> Walkera<00:03:58.040> controller

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
wk remote program the Walkera controller

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:08.680

program

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.810 

so<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.960> is<00:04:10.140> just<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.530> main<00:04:10.680> screens<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
so this is just the main screens so

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.230

can<00:04:39.840> turn<00:04:40.170> on<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:41.330> gravity<00:04:42.330> sensor<00:04:42.720> they

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
can turn on this gravity sensor they

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.690 
can turn on this gravity sensor they
call<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.470> allows<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.010> use<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
call it and that allows you to use the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.330 
call it and that allows you to use the
tilt<00:04:44.940> function<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.570> control<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.140> so<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.160> right

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
tilt function to control it so the right

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.510 
tilt function to control it so the right
stick<00:04:47.640> there's<00:04:47.910> moving<00:04:48.270> around<00:04:48.510> as<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.350> tilt

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.910 

you<00:04:53.520> won't<00:04:53.670> have<00:04:53.880> any<00:04:54.030> control<00:04:54.450> yet<00:04:54.770> see<00:04:55.770> we

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
you won't have any control yet see we

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.370 
you won't have any control yet see we
have<00:04:56.070> no<00:04:56.250> control<00:04:56.640> over<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.940> model<00:04:57.270> we<00:04:58.200> need

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
have no control over the model we need

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.150 
have no control over the model we need
to<00:04:58.850> press<00:04:59.850> the<00:05:00.030> power<00:05:00.210> here<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.020> then<00:05:01.980> we'll

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
to press the power here and then we'll

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.400 
to press the power here and then we'll
have<00:05:02.340> control<00:05:02.760> over<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:06.230> okay<00:05:07.230> our<00:05:07.380> third

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
have control over it okay our third

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.820 
have control over it okay our third
option<00:05:07.950> is<00:05:08.370> to<00:05:08.400> use<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.880> controller<00:05:09.570> with<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
option is to use the controller with the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.490 
option is to use the controller with the
I<00:05:10.950> device<00:05:11.720> so<00:05:12.720> we're<00:05:12.840> going<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.020> bind<00:05:13.200> with<00:05:13.410> our

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
I device so we're going to bind with our

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:26.580 
I device so we're going to bind with our
controller

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.590 

okay<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:27.650> that's<00:05:27.979> bound<00:05:31.180> okay<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.240> we<00:05:32.479> have

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
okay so that's bound okay so we have

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.150 
okay so that's bound okay so we have
control<00:05:32.960> there<00:05:33.199> then<00:05:33.410> we<00:05:33.500> can<00:05:33.650> go<00:05:33.800> into<00:05:33.979> our

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
control there then we can go into our

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.400 
control there then we can go into our
settings<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.759> select<00:05:35.000> our<00:05:35.150> network

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.850 

okay<00:05:39.410> so<00:05:39.530> we're<00:05:39.740> connected<00:05:40.190> there<00:05:41.680> go<00:05:42.680> back

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
okay so we're connected there go back

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.990 
okay so we're connected there go back
and<00:05:43.039> find<00:05:43.220> our<00:05:43.400> controller<00:05:43.759> program<00:05:45.759> go<00:05:46.759> into

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
and find our controller program go into

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.970 
and find our controller program go into
here

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.300 

now<00:05:56.580> we<00:05:56.640> have<00:05:57.170> the<00:05:58.170> video<00:05:58.290> coming<00:05:58.860> into<00:05:59.190> the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
now we have the video coming into the

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.030 
now we have the video coming into the
iPad<00:06:00.650> but<00:06:01.650> we<00:06:01.770> can<00:06:01.950> control<00:06:02.280> it<00:06:02.610> with<00:06:04.040> the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
iPad but we can control it with the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.570 
iPad but we can control it with the
controller<00:06:06.560> so<00:06:07.560> what<00:06:07.740> that<00:06:07.860> means<00:06:08.130> is<00:06:08.310> you<00:06:08.400> can

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
controller so what that means is you can

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.490 
controller so what that means is you can
fly<00:06:08.760> around<00:06:09.090> while<00:06:09.420> when<00:06:09.570> your<00:06:09.750> friends<00:06:10.290> or

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
fly around while when your friends or

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.110 
fly around while when your friends or
several<00:06:11.010> friends<00:06:11.280> are<00:06:11.430> connected<00:06:11.880> with<00:06:12.030> their

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
several friends are connected with their

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.450 
several friends are connected with their
AI<00:06:12.180> devices<00:06:12.780> and<00:06:13.110> they<00:06:13.650> can<00:06:13.830> watch<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.250> flight

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
AI devices and they can watch the flight

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.400 
AI devices and they can watch the flight
through<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:14.760> on-board<00:06:15.600> camera<00:06:15.840> while<00:06:16.230> you're
