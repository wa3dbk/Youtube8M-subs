00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.230
 the gods of computing 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.400
 hello to you young friends from the networks 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.410
 social 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.820
 the god of computing that we 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.770
 let's talk today is called ray 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.180
 tomlinson and it's thanks to him if 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.830
 today we can trade 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.860
 from one computer to another messages 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.840
 in form 10 may in 1971 this scholar of 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.710
 genius is already working on the ancestor 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.320
 internet 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.759
 arpanet an internal network created by the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.759
 US defense for military purposes 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.030
 the idea of ​​the arpanet is to put 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.710
 point a communication network that 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.840
 even works in case of attacked 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.550
 nuclear on the territory of states 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.760
 united when the normal telephone network 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.530
 no longer meets first step succeed at 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.920
 make them communicate with each other 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.920
 computers 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 but that was not just about transferring 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 data from one computer to another is 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 not easy thing in 1971 ray tomlinson 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.070
 therefore begins by developing a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280
 program 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.619
 msg snd for scene message that goes 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.479
 allow multiple users to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.780
 exchange messages on the same 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.780
 computer 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.510
 m 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:30.950
 so 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:32.810
 o mixing smd msg with a program 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.850
 experimental file transfer 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.250
 tomlinson will successfully connect two 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.170
 computers together and to send the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.950
 first mail in the history of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560
 computing 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.360
 they chose the arobase to separate the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 user name the name of 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.640
 the computer on which he is 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.620
 checked in 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.700
 a sign that is always used of our 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.700
 days in your email addresses 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.730
 in the years that will follow 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.410
 researchers working in this field 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.350
 will start to use massively 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.110
 emails but the first person 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.000
 public to have sent an email is his 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.690
 Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.200
 from England on March 26, 1976 since a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.200
 military base 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.730
 elizabeth ii from england is at these 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.740
 Technology buffs keep sending 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.030
 emails and it would even appear 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.030
 they have an ipad 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.690
 but you do not have to crs 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.880
 on the side because it is he who has 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.980
 designed and sent the very first mail of 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.560
 the history of computing and nothing but 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.900
 for that he deserves his place here at 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.900
 the pantheon of the computer gods 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.440
 epitech beds new gods of 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.440
 IT may be you
