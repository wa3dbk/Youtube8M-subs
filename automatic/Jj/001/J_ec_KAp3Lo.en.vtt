00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
the level right now it's very clean and

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.620 
the level right now it's very clean and
well<00:01:12.950> lit<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.219> pristine<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.119> as<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.390> battle

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
well lit and pristine but as the battle

well lit and pristine but as the battle
rages<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.229> on<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:16.100> going<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:16.310> get<00:01:16.430> more

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
rages on and on it's going to get more

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.440 
rages on and on it's going to get more
and<00:01:16.759> more<00:01:16.820> damaged<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:19.000> for<00:01:20.000> example<00:01:20.329> we

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
and more damaged so in for example we

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.300 
and more damaged so in for example we
have<00:01:20.570> integrated<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.469> lot<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.740> choreograph<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
have integrated a lot of choreograph the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.249 
have integrated a lot of choreograph the
winds<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.969> sandbox<00:01:23.210> brilliant<00:01:23.929> so<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
winds in the sandbox brilliant so you

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.499 
winds in the sandbox brilliant so you
have<00:01:24.590> here<00:01:24.859> for<00:01:25.009> example<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.670> Delian<00:01:26.270> unit

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
have here for example the Delian unit

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.450 
have here for example the Delian unit
pinger<00:01:26.899> coming<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.350> which<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
pinger coming in which is the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.419 
pinger coming in which is the
choreography<00:01:28.969> itself<00:01:29.359> but<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.070> important

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
choreography itself but the important

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.219 
choreography itself but the important
thing<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.729> like<00:01:32.060> unlike<00:01:32.509> your<00:01:32.659> typical<00:01:32.780> games

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
thing is like unlike your typical games

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.690 
thing is like unlike your typical games
where<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.679> will<00:01:33.859> be<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.009> completely<00:01:34.460> linear

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.480 
survive one thing that's going to happen
here<00:01:57.289> is<00:01:57.409> we're<00:01:57.829> going<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.009> look<00:01:58.189> around<00:01:58.369> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
here is we're going to look around the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.190 
here is we're going to look around the
corner<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:58.969> figure<00:01:59.390> out<00:01:59.450> what<00:01:59.659> weapons<00:02:00.049> are

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
corner and figure out what weapons are

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.660 
corner and figure out what weapons are
around<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.679> sandbox<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.340> can<00:02:01.490> use<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
around the sandbox that we can use to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.340 
around the sandbox that we can use to
take<00:02:01.909> out<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.179> pinger<00:02:02.450> because<00:02:02.749> the<00:02:02.960> shotgun

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
take out the pinger because the shotgun

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.899 
take out the pinger because the shotgun
isn't<00:02:03.619> going<00:02:03.770> to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
isn't going to

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.489 
isn't going to
on<00:02:03.969> it<00:02:04.149> so<00:02:04.689> we're<00:02:04.810> going<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.020> jump<00:02:05.200> over<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
on it so we're going to jump over the

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:06.959 
on it so we're going to jump over the
balcony<00:02:05.649> here<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.130> use<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.340> power<00:02:06.490> jump<00:02:06.850> of

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
balcony here and use the power jump of

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.820 
balcony here and use the power jump of
the<00:02:06.999> Nanosuit<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.960> across<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.410> space<00:02:08.619> and

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
the Nanosuit to get across the space and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.660 
the Nanosuit to get across the space and
survive<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.399> get<00:02:09.580> better<00:02:09.759> weaponry<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:12.519> I'm

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
survive and get better weaponry and I'm

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.979 
survive and get better weaponry and I'm
taking<00:02:12.819> quite<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.239> beating<00:02:13.480> here<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> mean

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
taking quite a beating here so I mean

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.390 
taking quite a beating here so I mean
what<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.410> really<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.190> use<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
what I really have to do is use the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
what I really have to do is use the
powers<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.940> suit<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.420> stealth<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.930> order

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
to get around the side of the pinger and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.610 
to get around the side of the pinger and
get<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.269> good<00:02:19.420> firing<00:02:19.690> position<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.319> order<00:02:20.500> to
