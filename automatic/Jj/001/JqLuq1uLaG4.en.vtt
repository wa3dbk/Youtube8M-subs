quickly<00:00:53.879> accumulating<00:00:54.539> some<00:00:54.690> damage<00:00:55.079> we've

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
quickly accumulating some damage we've

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
quickly accumulating some damage we've
only<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.770> thirty<00:00:56.100> seconds<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> have

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
only got thirty seconds that have

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
only got thirty seconds that have
elapsed<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.570> far<00:00:57.840> villager<00:00:58.649> using<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> Lloyd

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
elapsed so far villager using that Lloyd

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.599 
elapsed so far villager using that Lloyd
rocket<00:00:59.670> pretty<00:00:59.850> well<00:01:01.010> just<00:01:02.010> does<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> timber

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
rocket pretty well just does a timber

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.179 
rocket pretty well just does a timber
doesn't<00:01:02.940> really<00:01:03.149> succeed<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.189> but

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
doesn't really succeed with that but

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
doesn't really succeed with that but
then<00:01:05.339> he<00:01:05.369> also<00:01:05.760> pockets<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> splinters<00:01:07.380> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
then he also pockets the splinters I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.990 
then he also pockets the splinters I
guess<00:01:07.680> that'd<00:01:07.860> come<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> timber<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
guess that'd come out of the timber that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510 
guess that'd come out of the timber that
looks<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.110> duck<00:01:10.320> hunt<00:01:10.530> dog<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.950> already<00:01:11.159> out

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
looks like duck hunt dog was already out

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.880 
looks like duck hunt dog was already out

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
for oh and he does not make it it was a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
for oh and he does not make it it was a
semi<00:01:17.159> close<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.700> though<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.020> was

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
semi close actually though so that was

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.730

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.759 
and it would have been over just like it
was<00:03:07.489> already<00:03:07.730> though<00:03:08.290> Wario<00:03:09.290> all<00:03:09.469> he<00:03:09.590> had<00:03:09.680> to

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
was already though Wario all he had to

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.409 
was already though Wario all he had to
do<00:03:09.889> was<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.189> grab<00:03:10.400> him<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:10.879> that<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.239> what

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
do was just grab him and so that is what

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.030 
do was just grab him and so that is what
you<00:03:11.510> should<00:03:11.540> do<00:03:11.780> if<00:03:11.900> somebody's<00:03:12.290> shielding

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
you should do if somebody's shielding

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.369 
you should do if somebody's shielding
excessively<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.909> that's<00:03:14.659> probably<00:03:14.930> where<00:03:15.319> I

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
excessively and that's probably where I

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.099 
excessively and that's probably where I
am<00:03:15.979> flawed<00:03:16.549> as<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.819> Smash<00:03:17.150> Brothers<00:03:17.359> player<00:03:17.840> I
