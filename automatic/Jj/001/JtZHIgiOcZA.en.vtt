00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.830
 cyclist seems simple but the material comes all the way so is oscar freire 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.830
 also not completely satisfied before the start of the twelfth stage 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.189
 that asks in aerdt 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.899
 that state that it is to work a camera different feelings first two 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.699
 stores 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.550
 van baalen is trying to solve 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.560
 since the attack 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 has already had to open this year 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.329
 these channels 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.329
 is doing well with the explanation at that is in particular 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.780
 something effective is it for oscar freire it also had a perfect day came one 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.220
 to win a mass sprint 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.880
 and doesn't think the effect is great 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.190
 Yet Kevin's profit is not a subject of conversation 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 that is not to mention the case of this tour 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.570
 yes I think it's a pity that there are still those who don't understand 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
 because of this beautiful sport, companies just have to be sporty together 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.680
 Another work says the cheaters should get out 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.360
 therefore already knows two stages win and then in this way like a stone 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.530
 today 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.550
 Knowing about that knows there are not anyway as soon as you went after that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.740
 then you have to slide it out and then it doesn't matter if the second one is there 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.770
 they don't have extra of course 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.940
 extra power that in May in al baida network on the way out but I am disappointed 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.220
 you also know why 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 7 it was incorrect and that is nice of course but it is 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 correct that the controls in the residential areas and I think that is a good thing this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.870
 year is there anyway where the chance that we did they will be the record that in 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.480
 so this time 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.640
 yes i don't get it all either 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.690
 I am very much for the law 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.100
 20 per cent 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.210
 but I have never liked so 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.620
 what do you make then everything falls 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.540
 after her liberation with those above the law 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.640
 in their own words the first people who don't understand it and the rescue 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.260
 those benefits for but 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.720
 The jobs of many riders are formal for best Dutch 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.320
 coach and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.640
 yes then you have no shred of respect for that man knows nothing about it 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.040
 but I find this very sad
