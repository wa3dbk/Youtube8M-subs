 Sunday or Wednesday those who arrive 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.910
 by mail then well I tell you 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.370
 how is it that I do to get all 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.540
 these inserts so free without having to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.140
 buy the most newspapers 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.090
 here a long time ago there was a one of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.400
 the ladies who left the mail here in 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.920
 home 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 that had a box of those plastic 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.970
 of egüés feet full of different 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.440
 of these propagandas full of 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 answers and flyers and things 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 circulars of stores and that I already had 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.980
 to throw in the trash and between them 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.040
 there were many old ones that did not 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.270
 they needed more than previous weeks 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 so I told him you're going to vote that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 I said yes I asked if me please 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 I could fix told me take all the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.920
 what you want and then even if they were 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.000
 old people had known that the coupons to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.520
 sometimes they beat 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.550
 subsequent weeks or later months 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.860
 to the editing then well I took 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.600
 many this lady is no longer in my 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.450
 area but now there is a boy now 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.170
 new and good I asked the same question 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.180
 I said look, you know, because the girl 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.550
 Previous I was giving away the lady 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.190
 that some flyers when he tells me that 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.350
 some have to vote and I say 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.720
 you will also have me from time to time 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.220
 some that you over to me that the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.229
 give them away because I need the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.750
 coupons and he said yes yes I always have 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.580
 to return for trash to take away 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.009
 the returns already so that they vote them to the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.009
 trash I have no problem told me 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.780
 I'm going to put the ones that I can 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:18.130
 or those who have forgiveness then that's how it was 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 on Sunday that just happened I opened my my 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.760
 my mail and I found everything among these 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.939
 also the most propaganda of the area 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.140
 this is the way it looks like normally 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:37.280
 is a are many many circulars and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.739
 advertising that arrive together and then 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.489
 it's good that the flyer in my area 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.579
 supermarkets markets eye area 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.360
 because they always look in the red flow 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.159
 come sometimes the publix flyers 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.230
 I think they always come because public 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.209
 coincidentally begins your week here in 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.040
 Florida on Wednesday and the break plan 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.109
 It takes the arrives on Wednesday so it's 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.879
 I think that's why I always 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.700
 comes some public but those that 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.769
 they come by mail unlike the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.629
 that are in the store there are many times 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.239
 they bring here a coupon that says five 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.239
 discount dollars your purchase of 50 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.489
 dollars and well imagine when I 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.920
 They gave me the lady this gave me 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.470
 many of these and I got like six 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 coupons of five dollars each 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.750
 of publix so that was $ 30 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.270
 discount use them separately 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.490
 I bought 50 dollars in another purchase 50 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.230
 dollars and so and the coupons are worth 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.030
 one week 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.450
 so be careful with that, look at it well 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.300
 always the public and good flyers and 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.930
 each of these the goal of these 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.060
 ok packages of these k packages to these 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.220
 people about whom I have to 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.030
 send me a donation to the little children of 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.110
 Saint Jude 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.110
 OK so 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.100
 I ask you to try to do that if 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.700
 they have a good mailman or wallet a 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.970
 woman mailman that is friendly or that 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.310
 you think that you can help them 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.740
 ask him does not cost anything and look are 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.540
 five that I have now and I calculate that the 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.390
 next week although the boy and 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.340
 have more then maybe give me more these 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.530
 were those who entered me in my 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.310
 box because remember it was 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.050
 bent like this 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.610
 and this is all like everything that 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.580
 I enter more mail than I had 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.910
 staff so it's good that I give them that 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.919
 idea speak with your mailman and ask 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.810
 read and also another option that can 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.050
 to ask is at gas stations and 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.250
 Sunday night when already 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.830
 they sold all the newspapers and you 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.139
 they can give them the flyers that 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.669
 stay inside although good thanks to 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.650
 I hope everyone has this idea 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.020
 liked soon I will upload the other video 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.389
 I know I owe you one with the raffle that 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.990
 I promise to do it tonight or later 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:02.669
 tomorrow morning thank you all and 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.669
 Have a nice Sunday
