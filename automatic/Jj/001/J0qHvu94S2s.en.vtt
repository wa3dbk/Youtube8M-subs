00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
glitches in unpatched so that's pretty

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.289 
glitches in unpatched so that's pretty
useful<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:53.479> is<00:01:53.689> pretty<00:01:53.869> useful<00:01:54.049> for<00:01:54.590> doing

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
useful this is pretty useful for doing

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
glitches that are patched

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.710

and<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.770> don't<00:02:00.640> know<00:02:00.820> why<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.030> accidentally<00:02:01.570> hit

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
and I don't know why I accidentally hit

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.070 
and I don't know why I accidentally hit
the<00:02:01.780> credits<00:02:02.290> but<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:04.360> pretty<00:02:04.840> much<00:02:04.960> it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
the credits but that's pretty much it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.010 
the credits but that's pretty much it
for<00:02:05.320> ps3<00:02:06.070> but<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.610> doesn't<00:02:07.360> work<00:02:07.510> for<00:02:07.690> online

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
for ps3 but this doesn't work for online

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.460 
for ps3 but this doesn't work for online
for<00:02:08.259> either<00:02:08.680> Xbox<00:02:09.310> 360<00:02:09.940> or<00:02:10.090> ps3<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.140> keep<00:02:11.320> that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
for either Xbox 360 or ps3 so keep that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.590 
for either Xbox 360 or ps3 so keep that
in<00:02:11.620> mind<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.010> for<00:02:12.430> Xbox<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.940> actually<00:02:13.120> believe

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
in mind and for Xbox I actually believe

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.890 
in mind and for Xbox I actually believe
you<00:02:13.720> do<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.380> be<00:02:15.180> offline<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.420> actually<00:02:16.750> do

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
you do have to be offline to actually do

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.860 
you do have to be offline to actually do
it<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:18.100> Xbox<00:02:18.460> go<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.700> your<00:02:18.880> settings<00:02:19.240> hit

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
it so for Xbox go to your settings hit

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.820 
it so for Xbox go to your settings hit
memory<00:02:20.230> unit<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:23.020> hit<00:02:23.290> triangle

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
memory unit and then just hit triangle

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.090 
memory unit and then just hit triangle
oh<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:25.690> hit<00:02:25.930> triangle<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.440> believe<00:02:26.680> actually

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
oh just hit triangle I believe actually

cleared your catch then that's pretty

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.530

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
much it for Xbox is fairly simple I just

cleared the catch for all the games and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.780 
cleared the catch for all the games and
actually<00:02:47.290> did<00:02:47.560> think<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.250> would<00:02:48.400> get<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
actually did think that you would get a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.360 
actually did think that you would get a
message<00:02:49.120> when<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.050> started<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.650> game<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.160> I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
message when you started up a game but I

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.670 
message when you started up a game but I
started<00:02:52.360> up<00:02:52.510> fable<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.050> didn't<00:02:53.500> get<00:02:53.650> a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
started up fable and I didn't get a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.320 
started up fable and I didn't get a
message<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.340> don't<00:02:54.550> know<00:02:54.610> why<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:54.850> didn't<00:02:55.240> get

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
message so I don't know why I didn't get

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.570 
message so I don't know why I didn't get
a<00:02:55.390> message<00:02:55.660> here<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.590> honestly<00:02:57.130> thought

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
a message here but I honestly thought

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.610 
a message here but I honestly thought
you<00:02:57.880> would<00:02:58.180> get<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.360> message<00:02:58.540> about<00:02:59.020> updating

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.340 
you would get a message about updating
your<00:02:59.770> game<00:03:00.040> but<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.550> didn't<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.060> for<00:03:01.720> Xbox<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.290> do
