today I'm going to show you how to
change<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.280> lower<00:00:08.429> unit<00:00:08.670> oil<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.210> your

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
change the lower unit oil on your

change the lower unit oil on your
outboard<00:00:09.780> or<00:00:09.990> out<00:00:10.110> drive<00:00:10.410> fortunately<00:00:11.190> it's

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
outboard or out drive fortunately it's

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.009 
outboard or out drive fortunately it's
really<00:00:11.790> not<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:11.969> hard<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.660> all<00:00:12.690> you

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
really not that hard to do all you

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.169 
really not that hard to do all you
basically<00:00:13.200> need<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> screwdriver<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.700> pan<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
basically need is a screwdriver a pan to

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.630 
basically need is a screwdriver a pan to
catch<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> old<00:00:15.660> oil<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:16.800> fresh<00:00:16.830> lower<00:00:17.279> unit

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
catch the old oil some fresh lower unit

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.080 
catch the old oil some fresh lower unit
oil<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> some<00:00:18.480> rags<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> paper<00:00:19.199> towels<00:00:19.529> now

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
oil and some rags and paper towels now

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
oil and some rags and paper towels now
once<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> get<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> procedure<00:00:21.720> down<00:00:21.990> pat<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
once you get the procedure down pat it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
once you get the procedure down pat it
really<00:00:23.039> shouldn't<00:00:23.310> take<00:00:23.430> more<00:00:23.609> than<00:00:23.670> half<00:00:23.939> an

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
really shouldn't take more than half an

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.810 
really shouldn't take more than half an
hour<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
hour to do it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.890 
hour to do it
ideally<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.910> want<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> change<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.750> lower

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

unit oil in the fall before the winter
lay<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.179> that's<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.560> check<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.070> if

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lay up that's so you can check to see if

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.270 
lay up that's so you can check to see if
