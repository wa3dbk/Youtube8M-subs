millimeter beveled collar around it

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.340 
millimeter beveled collar around it
which<00:01:09.610> allows<00:01:09.909> them<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.150> tailor<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.870> response

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
which allows them to tailor the response

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.710 
which allows them to tailor the response
and<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.979> high<00:01:12.130> end<00:01:12.430> like<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> large<00:01:13.420> diaphragm

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
and the high end like a large diaphragm

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.180 
and the high end like a large diaphragm
microphone<00:01:14.380> but<00:01:14.619> maintaining<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:16.140> acoustic

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
principles of a small diaphragm so the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.500 
principles of a small diaphragm so the
diffused<00:01:20.650> field<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.130> really<00:01:21.790> really<00:01:22.119> smooth

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
diffused field is really really smooth

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.410 
diffused field is really really smooth
and<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.799> gradual<00:01:24.190> increase<00:01:24.640> from<00:01:24.909> cardioid

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
and the gradual increase from cardioid

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.249 
and the gradual increase from cardioid
the<00:01:25.900> super<00:01:26.200> cardioid<00:01:26.530> up<00:01:26.979> from<00:01:27.880> like<00:01:28.030> 6k<00:01:28.390> up<00:01:28.899> to

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
the super cardioid up from like 6k up to

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.550 
the super cardioid up from like 6k up to
20<00:01:29.560> K<00:01:29.969> this<00:01:30.969> is<00:01:31.810> there<00:01:31.899> anything<00:01:31.960> else<00:01:32.200> new

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
20 K this is there anything else new

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.020 
20 K this is there anything else new
inside<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.159> terms<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.490> electronics

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
inside a in terms of the electronics

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.779 
inside a in terms of the electronics
then<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.750> electronics<00:01:35.320> are<00:01:35.469> brand<00:01:35.770> new<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.340> I

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
then the electronics are brand new so I

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.990 
then the electronics are brand new so I
would<00:01:37.060> say<00:01:37.270> EMC<00:01:38.259> comes<00:01:39.070> Zoe<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.759> it's<00:01:39.880> not

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
would say EMC comes Zoe so it's not

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.300 
would say EMC comes Zoe so it's not
gonna<00:01:40.479> be<00:01:40.539> subject<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.409> interference<00:01:41.770> from<00:01:41.950> RF

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
gonna be subject to interference from RF

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.029 
gonna be subject to interference from RF
the<00:01:43.149> actual<00:01:43.420> amplifier<00:01:43.960> itself<00:01:44.619> they<00:01:44.829> didn't

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
the actual amplifier itself they didn't

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.010 
the actual amplifier itself they didn't
just<00:01:45.189> take<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.369> CMC<00:01:45.729> amplifier<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.719> make<00:01:46.869> it

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
just take a CMC amplifier and make it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.569 
just take a CMC amplifier and make it
they<00:01:47.140> built<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.530> from<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.770> ground<00:01:47.950> up<00:01:48.219> to

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
they built that from the ground up to

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.520 
they built that from the ground up to
work<00:01:48.820> in<00:01:49.090> conjunction<00:01:49.270> with<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.960> new<00:01:50.140> this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
work in conjunction with this new this

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.060 
work in conjunction with this new this
new<00:01:50.590> design<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.090> completely<00:01:52.509> parallel

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
new design and it's completely parallel

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.679 
new design and it's completely parallel
from<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.460> FE<00:01:54.969> T<00:01:55.149> out<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:56.020> very<00:01:56.859> very<00:01:57.189> very<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
from the FE T out so very very very you

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.569 
from the FE T out so very very very you
know<00:01:58.719> nice<00:01:58.990> design<00:01:59.409> for<00:01:59.950> that<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.249> they<00:02:00.369> didn't

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
know nice design for that so they didn't

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.429 
know nice design for that so they didn't
rehash<00:02:00.999> old<00:02:01.240> stuff<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.020> went<00:02:02.229> from<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
rehash old stuff and went from the

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.929 
rehash old stuff and went from the
ground<00:02:02.679> up<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.920> make<00:02:03.070> this<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.399> real<00:02:03.549> special

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
ground up to make this a real special

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.639 
ground up to make this a real special
microphone<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.810> also<00:02:05.079> I<00:02:05.109> see<00:02:05.289> that<00:02:05.469> it's

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
microphone and also I see that it's

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.340 
microphone and also I see that it's
go-to<00:02:05.829> tilting<00:02:06.310> heads<00:02:06.819> yes<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> 20

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
go-to tilting heads yes you get a 20

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.090 
go-to tilting heads yes you get a 20
degree<00:02:08.500> tilt<00:02:09.369> forward<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.569> back<00:02:11.530> so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
degree tilt forward and back so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.710 
degree tilt forward and back so
obviously<00:02:12.490> for<00:02:12.880> people<00:02:12.910> who<00:02:13.300> might<00:02:13.510> be<00:02:13.540> using

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
obviously for people who might be using

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.610 
obviously for people who might be using
it<00:02:14.170> as<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.580> dialog<00:02:15.580> or<00:02:15.940> even<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.690> late-night<00:02:17.440> host

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it as a dialog or even a late-night host

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.590 
it as a dialog or even a late-night host
who<00:02:18.069> might<00:02:18.250> want<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.490> have<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:18.880> on<00:02:19.030> his<00:02:19.180> on

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
who might want to have it up on his on

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.020 
who might want to have it up on his on
his<00:02:19.660> desk<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.980> allows<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.520> swivel<00:02:21.760> that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
his desk so it allows you to swivel that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.760 
his desk so it allows you to swivel that
