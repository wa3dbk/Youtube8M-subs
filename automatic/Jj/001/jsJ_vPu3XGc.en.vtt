00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:13.049
 I would like to know who is the creative of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 this wonderful advertising campaign 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 which can be seen in the m of Milan 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.820
 Psychoanalysis in comparison is nothing 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 this creative man managed to remove 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.630
 the anguish of death with this one 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.250
 advertising campaign for the other la 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.899
 flat of the funeral I photographed 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 see what is written here let's see if 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.000
 I get tired of the usual agency 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 funeral 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 finally there is the funeral outlet 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 complete funerals not seen well from 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 lire from â‚¬ goodnight ire 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.969
 etcetera etc. but this one 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.730
 something tired of the usual dinner 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.309
 so wonderfully funeral agency 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 releasing tired of the usual agency 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.420
 just because it's not just one thing it is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 referring to the funeral outlet I think 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.939
 that in my life in your life of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 anyone 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.290
 there is always a funeral agency there 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 we turn to bury some 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.470
 corpse for many is psychoanalysis but 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.790
 the psychoanalysis costs and formative I the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.130
 I advise everyone, but think about it though 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.439
 instead it costs such advertising 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.570
 which tells you you're tired of the usual agency 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.189
 hungry makes you think 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.250
 tired of the usual funeral agency 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.740
 tired of the usual funeral agency that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.320
 nice phrases like I wanted to think of it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.240
 this is what this slogan is 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.710
 tired of the usual funeral agency 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.149
 the anguish of the beautiful has passed me 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.409
 death 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.610
 goodbye from maddalena who then to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.330
 think of it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.970
 there is also to be questioned about creativity 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.620
 same because security is obvious that 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.130
 this ironic thing 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.660
 how a mind feels like this 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.820
 the image around a table of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 brainstorming as agencies do or 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.180
 maybe this is not part nor even of 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.730
 maybe a big advertising agency 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.240
 it was he and his brother-in-law thinking 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.250
 this thing tired of the usual agency 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.810
 funeral but how many bodies 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.290
 we buried how many corpses in the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.360
 thought physical corpses corpses of the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.670
 so many daily work life 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.370
 corpses we buried in the usual 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.650
 food agency 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.410
 the funeral outlet funeral a 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.800
 low cost and a whole metaphor 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.530
 beautiful funeral at low cost is enough 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.690
 enough dead in our head enough 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.580
 the cars the paintings will end that is you can 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.750
 bury spending little infuse 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.850
 beautiful who you are 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.280
 who you are creative of the outlet of 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.940
 funeral I want to meet you maybe if 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 a woman who you are revealed say you are 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:27.010
 I beg you I find you genial tired 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.870
 the usual tired funeral agency 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.380
 of the usual funeral agency of the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.830
 funeral funeral at low cost 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.209
 very beautifull 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.310
 she really likes the 6 revealed dishes 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.000
 revealed let us know who you are 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:51.270
 we want to reward no because then 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.060
 think about it this thing means 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.959
 that death is dead enough liquids 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.940
 that is, it is enough to spend little on death 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.010
 to think about the things of life and life 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.070
 and I have a friend who unfortunately had a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.690
 bad weather makes a woman he loved 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.840
 very beautiful man of two faiths 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.060
 his is that of his dead woman 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.220
 with the utmost respect for my friend 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.630
 I understand this thing I understand that there is not 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.509
 you want to be detached from loved ones 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.580
 but if I met one than a first 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.000
 appointment shows me with two faiths 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.979
 on the finger to the hand I don't know if I would 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.160
 want to make us a relationship would be 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.470
 impressed to say the attachment to 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.240
 dead the dead let her rest in 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.280
 peace let's have a funeral with the maximum 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.639
 respect your metaphorically 4 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.400
 speaking these dead let them go 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.259
 in the realm of mort without spending too much 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.410
 in our life metaphorically 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:58.530
 speaking just go ahead let's go 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.280
 ahead we are tired of the usual 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.979
 funeral agency is a bretton thing 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.580
 this is the surrealist manifesto in 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.530
 1924 written by breton bellissimo 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.599
 who knows what Breton would have said 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.259
 he would have found this gods thing surreal 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.560
 on rep 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.770

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.419

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.949
 meet you so give a kiss for 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.289
 this thing you did 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.810
 it lit me tired of the usual 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.580
 smart sterile agency I said also 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.159
 too much is enough just art must 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.229
 to suggest should not say as mine said 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.400
 teach paintings but I'm also told 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:42.060
 too much I love you whoever you are creative 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.280
 of the funeral outlet that then 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.630
 let's face the truth I have died in 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.810
 family my father and my mother 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.240
 first one then the other you are there stricken 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.280
 from the pain and pleasures because it is sad 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.009
 separating from a family member is not a thing 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.960
 tragic and serious desperate while flowering 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.630
 in the bar before it does that 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.469
 close the things to create the seals 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.490
 we have passed on to the myths 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.490
 mortuary room 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.759
 often there are also the people of the pumps 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.610
 funeral and you are there with your pain i 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.180
 your memories, mom, dad, anyone 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.819
 it is 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.440
 get some occupied areas some countries 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.569
 the agent of the bomber ropes vertices we have 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.469
 a beautiful chest in walnut 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:28.610
 the florin, even if you grieve that 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:30.000
 you cry I start thinking 5,000 euros 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.130
 6,000 euros 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.560
 if there would be something more 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.330
 economic and what we see the briar 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.690
 in walnut we can pass to the case of 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.979
 Swiss pine I know if there are i 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:47.460
 Swiss pines cost less than 3,000 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:51.260
 euro with flowers the thing the house la 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.789
 reading that carries 3 thousand and the pain for 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.740
 first somewhere else 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.320
 and you start to load c6000 is a 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.900
 3500 of something cheaper then 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.699
 there was less pensie melo only colored 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.669
 for mom the dad who flies row 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.289
 3 thousand euros 3,000 euros I do but there 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.570
 it would be something cheaper with 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:11.430
 which thing costs you less in the end 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.009
 asks people to blame the goal of 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.870
 well then it would be this florin 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:18.180
 we remove the orcs of the put maybe 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.020
 carnations in things an inscription 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.990
 simple goodbye mom escoto coast of 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.009
 this would be 1,800 full service 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.750
 euro 2,000 euros 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.279
 then you are a great pain from France 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.409
 for the loss of the fashion of the total of 

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:32.880
 crt 

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.469
 better to spend little in the end 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.560
 then everything ends 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:42.240
 mother and tried in the kingdom of heaven 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.219
 and I saved 2,000 euros 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.520
 that's how things are going so be it 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:50.940
 the car the funeral outlet because of the 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.279
 end to what we are most attached to 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.250
 pecunia or the loss of a loved one 

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:58.919
 extinct to pecunia and pecunia 

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.289
