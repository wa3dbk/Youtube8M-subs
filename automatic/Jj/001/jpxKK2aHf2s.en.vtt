00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
long enough time I know that electric

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
long enough time I know that electric
toothbrushes<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.049> expensive<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
toothbrushes are kind of expensive and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
toothbrushes are kind of expensive and
if<00:01:29.250> you're<00:01:29.430> someone<00:01:29.729> who<00:01:29.880> doesn't<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.420> get

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
if you're someone who doesn't really get

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
if you're someone who doesn't really get
a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> cavities<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.040> probably<00:01:32.310> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a lot of cavities then it's probably not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.130 
a lot of cavities then it's probably not
necessary<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.810> buy<00:01:33.960> one

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
necessary for you to go out and buy one

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
necessary for you to go out and buy one
of<00:01:34.170> these<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:35.189> you're<00:01:35.310> someone

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of these but I think if you're someone

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.280 
of these but I think if you're someone
who<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.180> does<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> history<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
who like me does have a history of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
who like me does have a history of

ton of mouth washes out there but a lot

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.840 
ton of mouth washes out there but a lot
of<00:04:19.420> them<00:04:19.570> are<00:04:19.750> just<00:04:19.859> focused<00:04:20.859> on<00:04:20.950> fresh<00:04:21.489> breath

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
of them are just focused on fresh breath

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.370 
of them are just focused on fresh breath
only<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.720> they're<00:04:23.140> not

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
only and they're not

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.800 
only and they're not
so<00:04:23.620> much<00:04:23.770> focused<00:04:24.160> on<00:04:24.280> dental<00:04:24.940> health<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.720> I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
so much focused on dental health and I

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.690 
so much focused on dental health and I
think<00:04:26.020> scope<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.890> those<00:04:27.070> types<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.400> brands

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
think scope and those types of brands

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.460 
think scope and those types of brands
are<00:04:27.790> more<00:04:27.970> about<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.690> having<00:04:29.020> really<00:04:29.230> fresh

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
are more about you having really fresh

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.140 
are more about you having really fresh
breath<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.010> not<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:30.430> about<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.640> cavity

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
breath and not so much about the cavity

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.360 
breath and not so much about the cavity
thing<00:04:31.390> but<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.050> actually<00:04:32.310> freshens<00:04:33.310> your

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
thing but this actually freshens your

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.880 
thing but this actually freshens your
breath<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.910> fights<00:04:34.450> cavities<00:04:34.750> because<00:04:35.740> it

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
breath and fights cavities because it

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.640 
breath and fights cavities because it
does<00:04:36.100> have<00:04:36.520> fluoride<00:04:37.390> in<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.110> any

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
does have fluoride in it and any

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.070 
does have fluoride in it and any
mouthwash<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.490> can<00:04:39.700> check<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.180> see<00:04:40.270> if<00:04:40.720> it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
mouthwash you can check and see if it

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.680 
mouthwash you can check and see if it
actually<00:04:41.110> says<00:04:41.950> on<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.940> back<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.480> has

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
actually says on the back that it has

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.810 
actually says on the back that it has
fluoride<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.590> purpose<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.100> anticavity

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
fluoride and the purpose is anticavity

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.700 
fluoride and the purpose is anticavity
so<00:04:46.420> I<00:04:46.450> do<00:04:46.540> definitely<00:04:46.720> recommend<00:04:47.260> this<00:04:47.290> brand
