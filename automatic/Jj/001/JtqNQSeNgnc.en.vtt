the bat I was actually very very close
to<00:01:24.330> gone<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> Willows<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.560> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to gone for the Willows because I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
to gone for the Willows because I
thought<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.070> he<00:01:26.369> would<00:01:26.520> end<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.240> for

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
thought that he would end up going for

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.660 
thought that he would end up going for
the<00:01:27.960> return<00:01:28.350> or<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> double<00:01:29.040> edge<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the return or the double edge but it is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
the return or the double edge but it is
the<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.000> first<00:01:30.240> turn<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> game<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the very first turn of the game there is

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
the very first turn of the game there is
really<00:01:31.500> no<00:01:31.740> reason<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.700> over<00:01:33.000> predict<00:01:33.360> or

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really no reason to over predict or

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.240 
really no reason to over predict or
predict<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> matter<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.159> I'm

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
predict for that matter so what I'm

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.530 
predict for that matter so what I'm
gonna<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> say<00:01:36.299> bowls

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
gonna do is just go for the say bowls

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
gonna do is just go for the say bowls
which<00:01:36.750> expected<00:01:37.650> him<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
which expected him to go for the you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.609 
which expected him to go for the you
term<00:01:39.180> which<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.390> thankfully<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.229> happens

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
term which is thankfully what happens

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.230 
term which is thankfully what happens
and<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.100> gonna<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.400> able<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> vote<00:01:41.759> switch<00:01:42.000> out

and I'm gonna be able to vote switch out
on<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.659> tyranitar<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.439> bring<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.890> my

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
on this tyranitar and bring in my

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.789 
on this tyranitar and bring in my
Garchomp<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.329> apply<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.259> offensive

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
Garchomp this way I apply some offensive

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
Garchomp this way I apply some offensive
pressure<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.220> him<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> prevents<00:01:48.360> him<00:01:48.420> from

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pressure to him and prevents him from

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
pressure to him and prevents him from
getting<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.930> stealth<00:01:49.200> rocks<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.740> early<00:01:50.040> on

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
getting up stealth rocks very early on

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
getting up stealth rocks very early on
in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> game<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.640> yes<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.780> excadrill

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
in the game now yes I do have excadrill

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.389 
in the game now yes I do have excadrill
but<00:01:52.470> still<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.250> those

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
but still I don't want to have those

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.670 
but still I don't want to have those
stealth<00:01:53.640> rocks<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.390> yet<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.470> gonna

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
stealth rocks up just yet so I'm gonna

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.810 
stealth rocks up just yet so I'm gonna
end<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> same<00:01:56.490> earthquake

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
end up going for the same earthquake

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
end up going for the same earthquake
because<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.390> very<00:01:57.479> early<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
because again it's very early in the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.450 
because again it's very early in the
game<00:01:58.380> there's<00:01:58.590> no<00:01:58.649> reason<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.070> me<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> over

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
game there's no reason for me to over

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.620 
game there's no reason for me to over
predict<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.450> locked

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
predict and I don't want to be locked

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
predict and I don't want to be locked
into<00:02:00.930> outrageous<00:02:01.710> yet<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> off<00:02:02.399> chance

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
into outrageous yet on the off chance

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
into outrageous yet on the off chance
that<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.240> Rotom<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.990> live<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> our<00:02:04.409> ridges

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that this Rotom can live to our ridges

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
that this Rotom can live to our ridges
because<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:06.000> burn<00:02:06.210> my<00:02:06.360> gosh<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
because you then can burn my gosh up and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.440 
because you then can burn my gosh up and
I<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.049> Garchomp<00:02:07.380> would<00:02:08.069> definitely<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.849> huge

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
I no Garchomp would definitely be a huge

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.390 
I no Garchomp would definitely be a huge
help<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.020> battle<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.619> predicting<00:02:11.069> him<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
go for the willow wisp I'm going

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.839 
go for the willow wisp I'm going
bring<00:02:13.569> in<00:02:13.720> my<00:02:13.900> own<00:02:13.930> Rotom<00:02:14.590> as<00:02:14.800> he<00:02:15.370> does<00:02:15.610> end<00:02:15.790> up

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
bring in my own Rotom as he does end up

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.280 
bring in my own Rotom as he does end up
golfer<00:02:16.270> I'm<00:02:16.480> not<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:16.870> too<00:02:17.050> worried<00:02:17.230> about

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
golfer I'm not really too worried about

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.740 
golfer I'm not really too worried about
it<00:02:17.440> just<00:02:17.650> because<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> resto<00:02:19.390> Chester

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
it just because this is a resto Chester

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.420 
it just because this is a resto Chester
Rotom<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> can<00:02:20.440> easily<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.860> rest<00:02:21.099> off<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
Rotom so I can easily just rest off the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.339 
Rotom so I can easily just rest off the
burn<00:02:21.610> as<00:02:21.849> i<00:02:21.910> go<00:02:22.660> for<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.870> volts<00:02:23.110> which<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
burn as i go for the volts which it

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.690 
burn as i go for the volts which it
turns<00:02:23.440> out<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.680> i'm<00:02:23.860> actually<00:02:23.950> faster<00:02:24.430> than

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
turns out that i'm actually faster than

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.190 
turns out that i'm actually faster than
him<00:02:24.849> when<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.030> was<00:02:25.060> hoping<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.629> would<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.870> slower

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
him when I was hoping I would be slower

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.930 
him when I was hoping I would be slower
so<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.920> could<00:02:27.129> get<00:02:27.220> switch<00:02:27.489> initiative

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
so I could get switch initiative

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
so I could get switch initiative
unfortunately<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.780> not<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.989> case<00:02:29.170> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
unfortunately that is not the case and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
unfortunately that is not the case and
then<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.709> turn<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:29.950> make<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> very<00:02:30.610> risky<00:02:31.000> play

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
then this turn I make a very risky play

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.720 
then this turn I make a very risky play
by<00:02:31.690> switching<00:02:31.989> in<00:02:32.230> my<00:02:32.349> Garchomp<00:02:32.650> luckily<00:02:33.550> for

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
by switching in my Garchomp luckily for

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.820 
by switching in my Garchomp luckily for
me<00:02:33.880> though<00:02:34.090> he<00:02:34.660> does<00:02:34.930> end<00:02:35.200> up<00:02:35.319> going<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.739> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
me though he does end up going for the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.680 
me though he does end up going for the
voltage<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> lowest<00:02:37.060> or<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.390> hydro

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
voltage and not the lowest or the hydro

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.420 
voltage and not the lowest or the hydro
pump<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.110> I'm<00:02:38.410> gonna<00:02:38.590> be<00:02:38.739> able<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:39.010> knock<00:02:39.220> him

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
pump and I'm gonna be able to knock him

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.130 
pump and I'm gonna be able to knock him
out<00:02:39.549> with<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.819> outrage<00:02:40.330> now<00:02:40.540> yes<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.019> still

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
out with the outrage now yes it is still

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.140 
out with the outrage now yes it is still
early<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.739> game<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.459> did<00:02:42.700> lock<00:02:42.940> myself

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
fearing the fact that he might have the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.690 
fearing the fact that he might have the
Fire<00:03:32.650> Blast<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.190> don't<00:03:33.340> want<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.549> stay<00:03:33.670> in

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
Fire Blast and I don't want to stay in

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.830 
Fire Blast and I don't want to stay in
and<00:03:33.880> take<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.120> hit<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:34.389> what<00:03:34.510> I'm<00:03:34.600> gonna<00:03:34.690> do<00:03:34.810> is

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
and take the hit so what I'm gonna do is

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.020 
and take the hit so what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:03:35.109> switch<00:03:35.470> into<00:03:36.040> my<00:03:36.160> tyranitar<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:36.970> I

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
actually switch into my tyranitar so I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.150 
actually switch into my tyranitar so I
could<00:03:37.209> possibly<00:03:37.569> get<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:37.959> my<00:03:38.500> stealth<00:03:38.920> rocks

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
could possibly get up my stealth rocks

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.770 
could possibly get up my stealth rocks
and<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.489> really<00:03:39.700> start<00:03:40.030> getting<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.420> good

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
and just really start getting that good

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.050 
and just really start getting that good
residual<00:03:41.260> damage<00:03:41.410> on<00:03:41.769> his<00:03:42.250> team<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:43.000> he

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
residual damage on his team but he

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.580 
residual damage on his team but he
predicts<00:03:43.510> my<00:03:43.690> sweet<00:03:43.900> challenge<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.260> gonna<00:03:44.350> go

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
predicts my sweet challenge is gonna go

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.870 
predicts my sweet challenge is gonna go
for<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.829> stealth<00:03:45.040> rocks<00:03:45.220> either<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.549> or<00:03:45.670> he

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
for the stealth rocks either that or he

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.340 
for the stealth rocks either that or he
doesn't<00:03:46.060> have<00:03:46.239> fire<00:03:46.450> blocks<00:03:46.720> but<00:03:46.900> still<00:03:47.139> I'm

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
doesn't have fire blocks but still I'm

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.410 
doesn't have fire blocks but still I'm
thinking<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.100> maybe<00:03:48.310> he<00:03:48.579> does<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:48.819> Firebug

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
thinking that maybe he does have Firebug

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.699 
thinking that maybe he does have Firebug
so<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.600> have<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.810> keep<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.109> in<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.290> back<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.530> my

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
so I have to keep that in the back of my

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.590 
so I have to keep that in the back of my
mind<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.130> then<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.940> know<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.389> he's<00:03:52.480> gonna

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
mind and then I know that he's gonna

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.629 
mind and then I know that he's gonna
predict<00:03:53.049> me<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.319> go<00:03:53.470> for<00:03:53.829> my<00:03:53.859> stealth<00:03:54.280> rock<00:03:54.489> so

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
predict me to go for my stealth rock so

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.460 
predict me to go for my stealth rock so
what<00:03:54.790> I'm<00:03:54.880> gonna<00:03:55.000> do<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.120> predict<00:03:55.630> him<00:03:55.810> to

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
what I'm gonna do is predict him to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.559 
what I'm gonna do is predict him to
bring<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:56.889> Exeter<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.489> I'm<00:03:57.760> gonna<00:03:57.940> go<00:03:58.180> for<00:03:58.450> the

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
bring in Exeter and I'm gonna go for the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.660 
bring in Exeter and I'm gonna go for the
crunch<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.410> is<00:03:59.560> exactly<00:03:59.590> what<00:04:00.280> happens

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
crunch and that is exactly what happens

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.949 
crunch and that is exactly what happens
and<00:04:00.760> I'm<00:04:00.849> gonna<00:04:01.000> be<00:04:01.180> able<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.450> knock<00:04:01.690> out<00:04:01.900> that

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
and I'm gonna be able to knock out that

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.199 
and I'm gonna be able to knock out that
Exeter<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:03.280> noticed<00:04:03.609> he<00:04:03.790> had<00:04:03.849> mold

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
Exeter and I just noticed he had mold

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.050 
Exeter and I just noticed he had mold
breaker<00:04:04.329> on<00:04:04.660> Exeter<00:04:05.139> with<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.470> tyranitar

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
breaker on Exeter with the tyranitar

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.129 
breaker on Exeter with the tyranitar
that's<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.359> bit<00:04:07.450> odd<00:04:07.599> if<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.840> ask<00:04:07.989> me

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
that's a little bit odd if you ask me

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.509 
that's a little bit odd if you ask me
but<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.349> guess<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.739> end<00:04:08.769> even<00:04:09.040> if<00:04:09.190> he<00:04:09.310> had

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
but I guess in the end even if he had

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.809 
but I guess in the end even if he had
sandwich<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.389> wouldn't<00:04:10.810> have<00:04:10.930> mattered<00:04:11.079> so<00:04:11.859> he

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
sandwich it wouldn't have mattered so he

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.250 
sandwich it wouldn't have mattered so he
brings<00:04:12.970> in<00:04:13.150> staraptor<00:04:13.419> I<00:04:13.720> don't<00:04:13.959> want<00:04:14.079> to<00:04:14.139> take

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
brings in staraptor I don't want to take

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.960 
brings in staraptor I don't want to take
a<00:04:14.290> u-turn<00:04:14.530> or<00:04:14.889> close<00:04:15.099> combat<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.700> i<00:04:15.760> know<00:04:15.819> i

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
a u-turn or close combat and i know i

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.819 
a u-turn or close combat and i know i
will<00:04:16.299> have<00:04:16.450> used<00:04:16.690> for<00:04:16.840> tyranitar<00:04:17.410> later<00:04:17.650> in

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
will have used for tyranitar later in

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.110 
will have used for tyranitar later in
the<00:04:17.919> battle<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.669> what<00:04:18.789> I'm<00:04:18.880> gonna<00:04:18.970> do<00:04:19.090> is

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
the battle so what I'm gonna do is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.849 
the battle so what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:04:19.359> switch<00:04:19.660> into<00:04:19.989> my<00:04:20.139> Garchomp<00:04:20.440> this

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
actually switch into my Garchomp this

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.040 
actually switch into my Garchomp this
way<00:04:21.039> if<00:04:21.160> he<00:04:21.250> does<00:04:21.519> go<00:04:21.729> for<00:04:21.909> the<00:04:21.970> u-turn<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.570> can

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
way if he does go for the u-turn I can

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.630 
way if he does go for the u-turn I can
get<00:04:23.169> switch<00:04:23.409> initiative<00:04:23.919> as<00:04:24.010> he<00:04:24.130> knocks<00:04:24.340> me

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
get switch initiative as he knocks me

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.490 
get switch initiative as he knocks me
out<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:25.000> then<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.450> can<00:04:25.659> also<00:04:25.780> get<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.260> extra

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
out and then I can also get that extra

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.790 
out and then I can also get that extra
bit

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
bit

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.770 
bit
brazil<00:04:27.069> damage<00:04:27.520> with<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.150> rough<00:04:28.360> skin<00:04:28.599> which

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
brazil damage with the rough skin which

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.480 
brazil damage with the rough skin which
will<00:04:28.930> possibly<00:04:29.139> help<00:04:29.530> me<00:04:29.680> out<00:04:29.770> later<00:04:30.069> in<00:04:30.340> this

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
will possibly help me out later in this

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.249 
will possibly help me out later in this
game<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:31.330> he<00:04:31.449> does<00:04:31.659> end<00:04:31.810> up<00:04:31.870> going<00:04:32.080> for<00:04:32.199> the

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
game so he does end up going for the

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.809 
game so he does end up going for the
u-turn<00:04:32.500> as<00:04:32.680> he<00:04:32.770> brings<00:04:32.949> in<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.280> tyranitar

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
u-turn as he brings in the tyranitar

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.330 
u-turn as he brings in the tyranitar
here<00:04:34.479> i<00:04:34.509> would<00:04:34.990> have<00:04:35.139> brought<00:04:35.349> in<00:04:35.560> my<00:04:35.710> Blaziken

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
here i would have brought in my Blaziken

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.580 
here i would have brought in my Blaziken
but<00:04:36.849> I'm<00:04:36.970> really<00:04:37.270> fearing<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.990> fact<00:04:38.229> that<00:04:38.349> he

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
but I'm really fearing the fact that he

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.399 
but I'm really fearing the fact that he
does<00:04:38.889> have<00:04:39.129> the<00:04:39.250> focus<00:04:39.639> ash<00:04:39.819> on<00:04:40.060> Alakazam<00:04:40.750> so

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
does have the focus ash on Alakazam so

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.350 
does have the focus ash on Alakazam so
instead<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.860> actually<00:04:42.069> bring<00:04:42.400> in<00:04:42.520> my<00:04:42.639> tyranitar

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
instead I actually bring in my tyranitar

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.839 
instead I actually bring in my tyranitar
this<00:04:43.599> way<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.080> can<00:04:44.590> kind<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.889> maybe<00:04:45.129> lure<00:04:45.610> out

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
this way I can kind of maybe lure out

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.300 
this way I can kind of maybe lure out
Alakazam<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.659> break<00:04:46.930> your<00:04:47.080> sash<00:04:47.379> and<00:04:47.680> then

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
Alakazam to break your sash and then

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.559 
Alakazam to break your sash and then
bring<00:04:48.520> in<00:04:48.639> my<00:04:48.729> Blaziken<00:04:49.180> for<00:04:49.389> late-game

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
bring in my Blaziken for late-game

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.990 
bring in my Blaziken for late-game
sweeping<00:04:50.289> but<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:51.039> am<00:04:51.370> just<00:04:51.550> gonna<00:04:51.610> go<00:04:51.819> for<00:04:51.940> the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
sweeping but I am just gonna go for the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.279 
sweeping but I am just gonna go for the
stealth<00:04:52.240> rocks<00:04:52.449> as<00:04:52.599> he's<00:04:52.750> going<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:53.050> end<00:04:53.199> up

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
stealth rocks as he's going to end up

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.480 
stealth rocks as he's going to end up
going<00:04:53.530> for<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.770> Stone<00:04:53.979> Age<00:04:54.129> which<00:04:54.370> is

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
going for the Stone Age which is

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.249 
going for the Stone Age which is
perfectly<00:04:54.819> fine<00:04:54.909> by<00:04:55.150> me<00:04:55.300> because<00:04:55.449> I<00:04:55.629> know<00:04:55.870> that

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
perfectly fine by me because I know that

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.260 
perfectly fine by me because I know that
the<00:04:56.680> only<00:04:56.800> real<00:04:57.099> reason<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.520> need<00:04:57.699> tyranitar

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
the only real reason I need tyranitar

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.149 
the only real reason I need tyranitar
right<00:04:58.419> now<00:04:58.599> is<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.810> get<00:04:59.050> my<00:04:59.229> stand<00:04:59.530> up<00:04:59.680> later<00:04:59.949> in

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
right now is to get my stand up later in

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.490 
right now is to get my stand up later in
game<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:01.000> not<00:05:01.389> want<00:05:01.569> to<00:05:01.659> take<00:05:01.810> another<00:05:02.020> hit<00:05:02.349> I'm

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
game so not want to take another hit I'm

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.230 
game so not want to take another hit I'm
actually<00:05:02.650> gonna<00:05:02.860> switch<00:05:03.099> into<00:05:03.430> my<00:05:03.610> Skarmory

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
actually gonna switch into my Skarmory

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.719 
actually gonna switch into my Skarmory
and<00:05:04.270> also<00:05:05.229> I<00:05:05.259> know<00:05:05.469> that<00:05:05.830> he<00:05:06.009> still<00:05:06.310> might

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
and also I know that he still might

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.520 
and also I know that he still might
possibly<00:05:07.120> have<00:05:07.419> Fire<00:05:07.810> Blast<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:08.319> what<00:05:08.440> I'm

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
possibly have Fire Blast so what I'm

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.350 
possibly have Fire Blast so what I'm
gonna<00:05:08.620> do<00:05:08.740> this<00:05:08.979> turn<00:05:09.159> is<00:05:09.430> actually<00:05:10.120> switch

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
gonna do this turn is actually switch

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.839 
gonna do this turn is actually switch
into<00:05:10.750> my<00:05:10.900> Rotom<00:05:11.440> predicting<00:05:12.340> him<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.639> fire

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
into my Rotom predicting him to fire

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.909 
into my Rotom predicting him to fire
blast<00:05:13.180> then<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:13.960> way<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.199> can<00:05:14.500> go<00:05:14.620> for<00:05:14.830> the

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
blast then that way I can go for the

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.070 
blast then that way I can go for the
rest<00:05:15.129> with<00:05:15.370> my<00:05:15.520> Rotom<00:05:15.940> have<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.389> be<00:05:16.569> a<00:05:16.599> full<00:05:16.900> HP

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
rest with my Rotom have it be a full HP

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.670 
rest with my Rotom have it be a full HP
to<00:05:17.800> possibly<00:05:18.190> take<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> hit<00:05:18.729> from<00:05:18.849> Alakazam

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
to possibly take a hit from Alakazam

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.899 
to possibly take a hit from Alakazam
Charizard<00:05:20.680> or<00:05:20.889> star<00:05:21.190> after<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.639> get<00:05:21.759> off<00:05:21.879> a

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
Charizard or star after and get off a

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.219 
Charizard or star after and get off a
good<00:05:22.060> amount<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.449> damage<00:05:22.750> with<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.020> volt

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
good amount of damage with the volt

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.320 
good amount of damage with the volt
switch<00:05:23.379> but<00:05:24.129> he<00:05:24.280> actually<00:05:24.430> switches<00:05:24.879> directly

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
switch but he actually switches directly

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.999 
switch but he actually switches directly
into<00:05:25.509> Charizard<00:05:25.930> which<00:05:26.289> automatically

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
into Charizard which automatically

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.619 
into Charizard which automatically
confirms<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.610> fact<00:05:27.789> that<00:05:27.849> he<00:05:28.030> does<00:05:28.240> not<00:05:28.270> have

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
confirms the fact that he does not have

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.990 
confirms the fact that he does not have
fire<00:05:28.900> blasts<00:05:29.199> and<00:05:29.430> unfortunately<00:05:30.430> now<00:05:30.699> i<00:05:30.729> am

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
fire blasts and unfortunately now i am

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.120 
fire blasts and unfortunately now i am
basically<00:05:31.270> going<00:05:31.569> to<00:05:31.810> end<00:05:32.020> up<00:05:32.110> losing<00:05:32.529> my

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
basically going to end up losing my
