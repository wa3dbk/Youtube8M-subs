00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
out here so I can actually do this now

out here so I can actually do this now
I'm<00:00:23.939> hearing<00:00:24.150> things<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> anyway<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.390> decided

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
I'm hearing things so anyway I decided

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.109 
I'm hearing things so anyway I decided
to<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> lot<00:00:28.710> lens<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:29.220> hair<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.939> because

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
to do a lot lens on my hair just because

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.040 
to do a lot lens on my hair just because
I<00:00:31.759> haven't<00:00:32.759> done<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> while<00:00:33.480> since<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I haven't done one in a while since I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
I haven't done one in a while since I
did<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.320> baking<00:00:34.620> soda<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.730> could<00:00:35.880> just

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
did the baking soda and I could just

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.910 
did the baking soda and I could just
kind<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.390> tell<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:37.170> hair<00:00:37.380> wasn't<00:00:37.770> just

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
kind of tell that my hair wasn't just

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.569 
kind of tell that my hair wasn't just
jet-black

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
jet-black

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.680 
jet-black
as<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:40.219> after<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> did<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> figured

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
as it was after I did that so I figured

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.010 
as it was after I did that so I figured
it's<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> good<00:00:43.440> plan<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> decided

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it's time for a good plan so I decided

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
it's time for a good plan so I decided
to<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.710> bentonite<00:00:47.100> clay<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.730> time

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to use the bentonite clay this time

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
to use the bentonite clay this time
because<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.050> baking<00:00:49.379> soda<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:50.010> harsh

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
because the baking soda was really harsh

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.020 
because the baking soda was really harsh
on<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.579> hair<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.699> only<00:00:54.090> fear<00:00:54.449> before<00:00:56.030> with

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
on my hair so my only fear before with

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.290 
on my hair so my only fear before with
the<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:57.390> look<00:00:57.719> clay<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.940> worried

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the using look clay was I was worried

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
the using look clay was I was worried
maybe<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.690> might<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> lint<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.010> my

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
maybe I might have a lot of lint in my

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
maybe I might have a lot of lint in my
hair<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.699> wouldn't<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.059> able<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.510> out

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
hair that wouldn't be able to get out

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.920 
hair that wouldn't be able to get out
and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.769> also<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.880> worried<00:01:06.390> because

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
and then also I was worried because

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.310 
and then also I was worried because
since<00:01:08.320> my<00:01:08.740> ends<00:01:09.280> art<00:01:09.550> lost<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:10.360> lot<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.080> people

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
since my ends art lost a lot of people

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.750 
since my ends art lost a lot of people
were<00:01:11.470> saying<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:11.950> makes<00:01:12.130> their<00:01:12.310> hair<00:01:12.490> really

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
were saying it makes their hair really

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.450 
were saying it makes their hair really
soft<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.510> was<00:01:13.930> kind<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.260> concerned<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.280> may

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
soft I was kind of concerned that it may

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.190 
soft I was kind of concerned that it may
unravel<00:01:15.730> my<00:01:16.300> ends<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.780> little<00:01:17.020> bit

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
unravel my ends a little bit

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.730 
unravel my ends a little bit
so<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:19.400> did<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:20.180> see<00:01:20.450> what<00:01:21.229> which<00:01:21.380> kind<00:01:21.710> of

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
so what I did to see what which kind of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.440 
so what I did to see what which kind of
give<00:01:21.860> me<00:01:21.950> an<00:01:22.040> idea<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.400> what<00:01:22.520> would<00:01:22.729> happen<00:01:23.150> if

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
give me an idea of what would happen if

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.649 
give me an idea of what would happen if
I<00:01:23.600> actually<00:01:24.009> did<00:01:25.009> it<00:01:25.159> on<00:01:25.280> just<00:01:25.520> too<00:01:25.939> long<00:01:26.240> in

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
I actually did it on just too long in

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.060 
I actually did it on just too long in
the<00:01:26.840> beginning<00:01:27.259> just<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.619> kind<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.890> do<00:01:28.040> a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the beginning just to kind of do a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.399 
the beginning just to kind of do a
little<00:01:28.340> test<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.509> just<00:01:29.720> took<00:01:29.930> two<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.290> my

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
little test so I just took two of my

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.219 
little test so I just took two of my
locks<00:01:30.649> one<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.250> them<00:01:31.490> there<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.570> end<00:01:32.750> peasant

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
locks one of them there the end peasant

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.130 
locks one of them there the end peasant
locks<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.549> one<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.539> hasn't<00:01:35.810> locked

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
locks and then one that it hasn't locked

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.230 
locks and then one that it hasn't locked
but<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.560> also<00:01:36.710> has<00:01:37.039> sliced<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.399> little<00:01:37.670> box<00:01:37.940> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
but it also has sliced a little box and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.929 
but it also has sliced a little box and
you<00:01:38.539> can<00:01:38.720> see<00:01:38.950> cuz<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.070> wanted<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.399> see<00:01:40.610> if<00:01:40.789> that

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
you can see cuz I wanted to see if that

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.060 
you can see cuz I wanted to see if that
would<00:01:41.119> have<00:01:41.270> not<00:01:41.479> depends<00:01:42.049> up<00:01:42.170> coming<00:01:42.590> off<00:01:42.710> so

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
would have not depends up coming off so

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.170 
would have not depends up coming off so
I<00:01:44.030> did<00:01:44.420> two<00:01:45.229> locks<00:01:45.530> left<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.220> on<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.369> like<00:01:46.610> 15

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
I did two locks left it on for like 15

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.380 
I did two locks left it on for like 15
minutes<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:48.399> didn't<00:01:49.399> really<00:01:49.549> seem<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.270> have

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
minutes and didn't really seem to have

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.899 
minutes and didn't really seem to have
any<00:01:50.539> unraveling<00:01:51.380> or<00:01:51.590> anything<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.729> went

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
any unraveling or anything so I went

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.870 
any unraveling or anything so I went
ahead<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.300> put<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.539> on<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.780> rest<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.140> my<00:01:54.289> hair

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
ahead and put it on the rest of my hair

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240 
ahead and put it on the rest of my hair
so<00:01:55.929> my<00:01:56.929> priscilla<00:01:57.289> rest<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.710> my<00:01:57.799> hair<00:01:58.039> is

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
so my priscilla rest of my hair is

shiny goofball like I just like I got

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.949 
shiny goofball like I just like I got
when<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.739> did<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> baking<00:02:44.340> soda<00:02:44.489> awesome<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
when I did the baking soda awesome and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.470 
when I did the baking soda awesome and
then<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.190> only<00:02:47.310> other<00:02:47.400> things<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.849> noticed<00:02:48.299> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
then the only other things I noticed is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.039 
then the only other things I noticed is
my<00:02:49.260> aunt's<00:02:49.799> are<00:02:50.069> really<00:02:50.940> curling<00:02:51.420> when<00:02:51.780> I

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
my aunt's are really curling when I

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.770 
my aunt's are really curling when I
wasn't<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.830> able<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.360> lot<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.660> my

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
wasn't really able to see a lot of my

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.330 
wasn't really able to see a lot of my
curls<00:02:55.700> recently<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:57.209> were<00:02:57.269> really<00:02:57.629> kind<00:02:58.019> of

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
curls recently they were really kind of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.009 
curls recently they were really kind of
meshing<00:02:59.340> Kaunas<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.480> think<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.840> maybe

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
meshing Kaunas so I think it maybe

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.160 
meshing Kaunas so I think it maybe
loosen<00:03:01.890> my<00:03:02.430> ends<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.299> bit<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.930> kind<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
loosen my ends a little bit and kind of

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.680 
loosen my ends a little bit and kind of
defined<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.920> mark<00:03:05.130> early<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.670> because<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.630> know

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
defined a mark early in because I know

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.289 
defined a mark early in because I know
people<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.560> loose<00:03:08.340> essential<00:03:08.880> hair<00:03:09.060> when

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
people with loose essential hair when

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.809 
people with loose essential hair when
they<00:03:09.450> use<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:09.870> their<00:03:10.110> hair<00:03:10.170> if<00:03:10.829> they<00:03:11.459> say<00:03:11.670> it

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
they use it on their hair if they say it

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.000 
they use it on their hair if they say it
defines<00:03:12.209> their<00:03:12.450> curls<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> guess<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.980> just

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
defines their curls so I guess it just

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.050 
defines their curls so I guess it just
kind<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.760> redefined<00:03:15.720> my<00:03:16.079> little<00:03:16.379> end<00:03:16.590> girl

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
kind of redefined my little end girl

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.539 
kind of redefined my little end girl
I've<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.269> kind<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.660> felt<00:03:19.049> my<00:03:19.290> hair<00:03:19.650> my<00:03:20.340> hair

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
I've just kind of felt my hair my hair

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.500 
I've just kind of felt my hair my hair
is<00:03:20.579> still<00:03:21.030> damp<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.950> kind<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.519> feeling<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.180> and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
is still damp but kind of feeling it and

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.940 
is still damp but kind of feeling it and
it<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.790> soft<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:28.200> wouldn't<00:03:28.440> say<00:03:28.620> up<00:03:28.739> as<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
it it is soft but I wouldn't say up as a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.410 
it it is soft but I wouldn't say up as a
novel<00:03:29.370> bit

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
novel bit

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.120 
novel bit
I<00:03:31.450> don't<00:03:32.170> know<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:32.440> kind<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.680> hard<00:03:32.740> to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
I don't know it's kind of hard to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.309 
I don't know it's kind of hard to
explain<00:03:33.910> like<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.810> don't<00:03:34.870> think<00:03:34.990> it's<00:03:35.200> them

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
explain like I don't think it's them

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.550 
explain like I don't think it's them
come<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.680> done<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.819> maybe<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.990> is<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.290> little

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
come on done but maybe it is a little

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.430 
come on done but maybe it is a little
bit<00:03:38.830> looser<00:03:39.580> than<00:03:40.000> what<00:03:40.270> it<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.569> before<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.200> did

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
bit looser than what it was before I did

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.940

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
all of it however it is so that's that

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.470 
all of it however it is so that's that
the<00:04:07.930> other<00:04:08.170> thing<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.920> happens<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:10.269> have<00:04:10.450> a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
the other thing that happens is I have a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.750 
the other thing that happens is I have a
lot<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.750> loose<00:04:11.170> hairs<00:04:11.560> explain<00:04:12.100> my<00:04:12.220> lock<00:04:12.430> smell

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
lot of loose hairs explain my lock smell

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.070 
lot of loose hairs explain my lock smell
that<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.180> didn't<00:04:13.450> have<00:04:13.570> before

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
that I didn't have before

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.210 
that I didn't have before
so<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.040> did<00:04:15.220> really<00:04:15.519> kind<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:15.940> loosen<00:04:16.450> up<00:04:16.600> so

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
so it did really kind of loosen up so

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.050 
so it did really kind of loosen up so
little<00:04:18.220> short<00:04:18.489> hairs<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.180> had<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.480> my<00:04:19.510> base

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
little short hairs that I had in my base

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.060 
little short hairs that I had in my base
so<00:04:22.060> if<00:04:22.180> I<00:04:22.300> choose<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.810> latch<00:04:22.990> again<00:04:23.230> I'll<00:04:23.680> put

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
so if I choose to latch again I'll put

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.460 
so if I choose to latch again I'll put
those<00:04:24.220> back<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.520> otherwise<00:04:25.270> I'll<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.600> won't

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
those back in otherwise I'll just won't

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.420 
those back in otherwise I'll just won't
worry<00:04:26.650> about<00:04:26.740> it

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
worry about it

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.540 
worry about it
but<00:04:29.060> other<00:04:29.270> than<00:04:29.389> that<00:04:30.250> oh<00:04:32.169> it<00:04:33.169> did<00:04:33.470> take<00:04:33.800> me<00:04:34.160> a

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
but other than that oh it did take me a

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.250 
but other than that oh it did take me a
lot<00:04:34.880> of<00:04:35.060> rinsing<00:04:36.550> what<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> was<00:04:37.820> finding<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:39.080> I

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
lot of rinsing what I was finding like I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.219 
lot of rinsing what I was finding like I
rinsed<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:40.250> couple<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.150> times<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.900> then<00:04:42.080> I

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
rinsed it a couple of times and then I

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.870 
rinsed it a couple of times and then I
got<00:04:42.500> out<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.800> shower<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.340> was<00:04:43.520> looking<00:04:43.760> at

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
got out of the shower and was looking at

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.850 
got out of the shower and was looking at
my<00:04:44.030> hair<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.540> could<00:04:44.720> see<00:04:44.990> little<00:04:45.380> white

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
my hair and I could see little white

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.300 
my hair and I could see little white
spots<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.790> stuff<00:04:47.260> so<00:04:48.260> some<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:49.250> course

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
spots and stuff so some of it of course

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.140 
spots and stuff so some of it of course
again<00:04:50.060> was<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.479> root<00:04:50.690> ball<00:04:50.900> but<00:04:51.440> then<00:04:51.620> also<00:04:52.150> it

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
again was the root ball but then also it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.810 
again was the root ball but then also it
was<00:04:53.300> kind<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:53.660> like<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.550> pasty<00:04:55.550> like

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
was kind of like this pasty like

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.659 
was kind of like this pasty like
substance<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.990> guess<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.380> could<00:04:57.530> say<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:58.610> I

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
substance I guess you could say and so I

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.760 
substance I guess you could say and so I
thought<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:58.940> had<00:04:59.240> got<00:04:59.510> all<00:04:59.810> of<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.260> out<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.620> my

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
thought I had got all of it out of my

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.370 
thought I had got all of it out of my
hair<00:05:01.039> so<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.400> went<00:05:01.639> back<00:05:01.789> rinsed<00:05:02.360> again<00:05:02.510> I<00:05:03.080> even

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
hair so I went back rinsed again I even

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.529 
hair so I went back rinsed again I even
put<00:05:03.560> my<00:05:03.680> hair<00:05:03.889> in<00:05:03.979> sections<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.820> ran<00:05:05.330> the

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
put my hair in sections and ran the

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.860 
put my hair in sections and ran the
water<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:06.500> each<00:05:06.770> lock<00:05:07.130> individually<00:05:07.970> we<00:05:08.479> fit

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
water to each lock individually we fit

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.770 
water to each lock individually we fit
all<00:05:09.139> of<00:05:09.169> it<00:05:09.470> got<00:05:10.340> back<00:05:10.580> out<00:05:10.760> again<00:05:10.910> checked<00:05:11.630> it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
all of it got back out again checked it

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.379 
all of it got back out again checked it
out<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.880> still<00:05:13.880> was<00:05:14.180> there<00:05:15.070> so<00:05:16.070> basically<00:05:16.490> my

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
out and still was there so basically my

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.120 
out and still was there so basically my
wrist<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.930> dressed<00:05:18.199> my<00:05:18.320> hair<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:18.620> four<00:05:18.889> times

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
wrist I dressed my hair like four times

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.029 
wrist I dressed my hair like four times
the<00:05:19.340> first<00:05:19.580> day<00:05:19.850> got<00:05:20.479> frustrated<00:05:21.289> came<00:05:21.740> back

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
the first day got frustrated came back

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.219 
the first day got frustrated came back
today's<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.789> second<00:05:23.180> day<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.780> rinsed<00:05:24.139> it

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
today's the second day and I rinsed it

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.770 
today's the second day and I rinsed it
like<00:05:24.440> once<00:05:24.770> or<00:05:24.979> twice<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.210> think<00:05:26.389> I<00:05:26.479> finally

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
like once or twice and I think I finally

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.219 
like once or twice and I think I finally
got<00:05:27.139> like<00:05:27.830> all<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.400> little<00:05:28.580> stuff<00:05:28.699> out<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:30.199> I

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
got like all that little stuff out so I

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.400 
got like all that little stuff out so I
guess<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.860> did<00:05:31.160> have<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:32.150> lot<00:05:32.539> of<00:05:32.570> buildup<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.260> it

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
guess I did have a lot of buildup and it

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.469 
guess I did have a lot of buildup and it
was<00:05:33.500> really<00:05:33.770> kind<00:05:33.950> of<00:05:34.010> focused<00:05:34.520> towards<00:05:35.210> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
was really kind of focused towards the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.200 
was really kind of focused towards the
roots<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:36.830> was<00:05:36.979> really<00:05:37.280> surprised<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.120> I

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
roots so I was really surprised that I

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.629 
roots so I was really surprised that I
had<00:05:38.479> that<00:05:38.750> much<00:05:39.229> that<00:05:39.800> I<00:05:39.860> have<00:05:40.099> to<00:05:40.280> keep

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
had that much that I have to keep

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.020 
had that much that I have to keep
rinsing<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.599> squeezing<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.440> out<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:43.070> was<00:05:43.280> so

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
rinsing and squeezing it out that was so

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.450 
rinsing and squeezing it out that was so
hard<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.479> I<00:05:44.599> was<00:05:44.750> creating<00:05:45.020> my<00:05:45.139> finger<00:05:45.530> so<00:05:46.430> I

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
hard that I was creating my finger so I

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.029 
hard that I was creating my finger so I
was<00:05:46.580> doing<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.940> so<00:05:46.970> much<00:05:47.289> so<00:05:48.289> I<00:05:48.320> really<00:05:48.860> need<00:05:49.010> to

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
was doing it so much so I really need to

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.800 
was doing it so much so I really need to
evaluate

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
evaluate

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.750 
evaluate
kind<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.530> what<00:05:51.680> I'm<00:05:51.800> using<00:05:52.040> because<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.580> don't

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
kind of what I'm using because I don't

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.420 
kind of what I'm using because I don't
really<00:05:52.910> use<00:05:53.120> a<00:05:53.150> lot<00:05:53.390> of<00:05:53.570> stuff<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.500> I'm<00:05:55.010> kind<00:05:55.370> of

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
really use a lot of stuff so I'm kind of

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.860 
really use a lot of stuff so I'm kind of
really<00:05:55.580> concerned<00:05:56.030> about<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.480> but<00:05:56.750> I'm

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
really concerned about that but I'm

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.050 
really concerned about that but I'm
really<00:05:57.050> doing<00:05:57.530> all<00:05:57.650> of<00:05:57.710> this<00:05:57.950> to<00:05:58.400> not<00:05:58.730> get

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
really doing all of this to not get

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.420 
really doing all of this to not get
product<00:05:59.480> build-up<00:05:59.870> I<00:06:00.200> guess<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:00.860> was<00:06:00.950> obvious

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
product build-up I guess it was obvious

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.050 
product build-up I guess it was obvious

watering<00:06:06.640> it's<00:06:07.640> not<00:06:07.790> even<00:06:08.030> really<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.210> sunny

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
watering it's not even really that sunny

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.010 
watering it's not even really that sunny
out<00:06:08.750> here<00:06:09.310> but<00:06:10.310> uh<00:06:10.340> oh<00:06:11.000> yeah

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
out here but uh oh yeah

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.830 
out here but uh oh yeah
so<00:06:12.110> after<00:06:12.410> evaluate<00:06:12.950> that<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.420> many<00:06:14.630> kind

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
so after evaluate that so that many kind

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.390 
so after evaluate that so that many kind
of<00:06:14.900> push<00:06:15.110> training<00:06:15.530> so<00:06:15.650> I<00:06:15.770> was<00:06:15.950> thinking<00:06:16.310> I

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
of push training so I was thinking I

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.800 
of push training so I was thinking I
wasn't<00:06:16.730> going<00:06:16.850> to<00:06:16.910> have<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.150> do<00:06:17.300> all<00:06:17.330> the

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
wasn't going to have to do all the

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.410 
wasn't going to have to do all the
rinsing<00:06:18.290> that<00:06:18.560> I<00:06:18.590> did<00:06:18.860> like<00:06:19.280> with<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:20.060> baking

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
rinsing that I did like with the baking

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.530 
rinsing that I did like with the baking
soda<00:06:20.800> so<00:06:21.800> that's<00:06:22.610> none<00:06:22.760> of<00:06:22.790> my<00:06:22.910> only<00:06:23.150> complaint

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
soda so that's none of my only complaint

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.920 
soda so that's none of my only complaint
with<00:06:23.900> it<00:06:24.050> really<00:06:24.470> so<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.310> have<00:06:25.460> to<00:06:25.610> see<00:06:25.850> if<00:06:26.780> I'm

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
with it really so I have to see if I'm

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.060 
with it really so I have to see if I'm
going<00:06:27.140> to<00:06:27.200> do<00:06:27.320> it<00:06:27.440> again

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
going to do it again

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.070 
going to do it again
I<00:06:28.150> don't<00:06:29.150> remember<00:06:29.360> how<00:06:29.600> long<00:06:29.660> it's<00:06:29.990> been

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
I don't remember how long it's been

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.320 
I don't remember how long it's been
since<00:06:30.500> I<00:06:30.620> did<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:30.980> baking<00:06:31.310> soda<00:06:31.520> lunch<00:06:31.880> so<00:06:32.270> I

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
since I did the baking soda lunch so I

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.300 
since I did the baking soda lunch so I
was<00:06:32.600> thinking<00:06:33.050> it<00:06:33.260> hadn't<00:06:33.650> been<00:06:33.830> that<00:06:34.070> long

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
was thinking it hadn't been that long

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.180 
was thinking it hadn't been that long
and<00:06:34.760> that<00:06:35.150> I<00:06:35.810> wouldn't<00:06:36.440> have<00:06:36.620> a<00:06:36.680> lot<00:06:36.860> of<00:06:36.919> stuff

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
and that I wouldn't have a lot of stuff

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.370 
and that I wouldn't have a lot of stuff
in<00:06:37.340> my<00:06:37.460> hair<00:06:37.760> so<00:06:38.419> I<00:06:38.450> don't<00:06:38.720> know<00:06:38.840> if<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.080> baking

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
in my hair so I don't know if the baking

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.070 
in my hair so I don't know if the baking
soda<00:06:39.590> didn't<00:06:40.220> get<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:40.700> out<00:06:40.880> are<00:06:41.270> some<00:06:41.660> new

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
soda didn't get it out are some new

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.110 
soda didn't get it out are some new
stuff<00:06:42.620> that's<00:06:42.919> not<00:06:43.310> in<00:06:43.520> there

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
stuff that's not in there

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.250 
stuff that's not in there
and<00:06:44.270> I<00:06:44.570> have<00:06:44.780> to<00:06:45.020> look<00:06:45.260> at<00:06:45.440> that<00:06:45.740> video<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:47.210> see

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
and I have to look at that video to see

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.939 
and I have to look at that video to see
how<00:06:48.550> long<00:06:49.550> ago<00:06:49.850> that<00:06:49.880> was

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949 
how long ago that was

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.909 
how long ago that was
okay<00:06:51.949> so<00:06:52.010> I<00:06:52.250> gotta<00:06:52.760> show<00:06:52.970> you<00:06:53.030> my<00:06:53.210> hair<00:06:53.479> I

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
okay so I gotta show you my hair I

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.800 
okay so I gotta show you my hair I
really<00:06:54.919> like<00:06:55.070> the<00:06:55.250> fluffiness<00:06:55.729> of<00:06:56.150> it<00:06:56.389> kind<00:06:56.720> of

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
really like the fluffiness of it kind of

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.200 
really like the fluffiness of it kind of
like<00:06:56.990> on<00:06:57.260> swelled<00:06:57.740> up<00:06:58.070> and<00:06:58.370> it<00:06:58.550> has<00:06:58.760> a<00:06:58.790> thicker

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
like on swelled up and it has a thicker

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.810 
like on swelled up and it has a thicker
appearance<00:06:59.389> to<00:07:00.020> it<00:07:00.050> very<00:07:00.770> cool

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
appearance to it very cool

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.520 
appearance to it very cool
which<00:07:02.300> probably<00:07:02.660> helps<00:07:02.960> that<00:07:03.020> it<00:07:03.320> probably

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
which probably helps that it probably

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.800 
which probably helps that it probably
kind<00:07:04.010> of<00:07:04.100> separated<00:07:04.669> a<00:07:04.729> lot<00:07:04.880> of<00:07:05.060> my<00:07:05.300> friends

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
kind of separated a lot of my friends

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.270 
kind of separated a lot of my friends
and<00:07:05.960> made<00:07:06.139> it<00:07:06.290> more<00:07:06.470> frizzy<00:07:06.860> and<00:07:07.130> that's

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
and made it more frizzy and that's

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.530 
and made it more frizzy and that's
probably<00:07:07.520> help<00:07:07.880> too<00:07:08.090> and<00:07:09.940> then<00:07:10.940> I<00:07:10.970> was<00:07:11.360> going

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
probably help too and then I was going

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.310 
probably help too and then I was going
to<00:07:11.600> say<00:07:12.729> that<00:07:13.729> I<00:07:13.760> wasn't<00:07:14.240> a<00:07:14.300> cancel<00:07:14.720> before<00:07:14.840> or

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
to say that I wasn't a cancel before or

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.740 
to say that I wasn't a cancel before or
after<00:07:15.770> joined<00:07:16.040> it<00:07:16.250> but<00:07:16.820> then<00:07:17.030> I<00:07:17.270> was<00:07:17.419> like<00:07:17.540> the

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
after joined it but then I was like the

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.870 
after joined it but then I was like the
bentonite<00:07:18.139> clay<00:07:18.200> cleanses<00:07:18.919> anyway<00:07:19.430> so

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
bentonite clay cleanses anyway so

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.120 
bentonite clay cleanses anyway so
shampooing<00:07:20.720> it<00:07:20.990> would<00:07:21.169> just<00:07:21.380> be<00:07:21.530> overkill<00:07:22.070> and

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
shampooing it would just be overkill and

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.920 
shampooing it would just be overkill and
just<00:07:22.610> putting<00:07:22.970> something<00:07:23.180> else<00:07:23.450> in<00:07:23.600> my<00:07:23.690> hair

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
just putting something else in my hair

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:40.400 
just putting something else in my hair
so<00:07:24.169> I<00:07:24.800> didn't<00:07:25.340> do<00:07:25.460> that

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.410 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.160 

and<00:07:40.740> we<00:07:40.920> had<00:07:41.100> some<00:07:41.340> decent<00:07:41.760> time<00:07:42.300> out<00:07:42.510> here<00:07:42.810> you

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.170 
and we had some decent time out here you

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.960 
and we had some decent time out here you
probably<00:07:43.590> be<00:07:43.680> able<00:07:43.920> to<00:07:44.010> tell<00:07:44.220> my<00:07:44.460> hair<00:07:44.700> the

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
probably be able to tell my hair the

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:56.840 
probably be able to tell my hair the
relating<00:07:45.420> jet-black

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:56.850 

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.150 

I<00:07:56.880> think<00:07:57.570> my<00:07:57.660> son<00:07:57.900> went<00:07:58.380> down<00:07:58.530> like<00:07:58.740> as<00:07:58.920> soon<00:07:59.100> as

00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160 
I think my son went down like as soon as

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.250 
I think my son went down like as soon as
I<00:07:59.370> came<00:07:59.430> out<00:07:59.760> here<00:08:00.500> so<00:08:01.610> anyway<00:08:02.610> I<00:08:03.060> think<00:08:03.960> that's

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.260 
I came out here so anyway I think that's

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.310 
I came out here so anyway I think that's
all<00:08:04.530> I<00:08:04.560> wanted<00:08:05.010> to<00:08:05.160> share<00:08:05.520> about<00:08:05.580> my

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:06.320 
all I wanted to share about my

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.530 
all I wanted to share about my
experience<00:08:07.320> with<00:08:07.650> it<00:08:07.680> so<00:08:08.610> we'll<00:08:09.090> see<00:08:09.120> what

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:09.540 
experience with it so we'll see what

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.140 
experience with it so we'll see what
