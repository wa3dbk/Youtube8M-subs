 the head of a barely open passerby and know-how while waiting for the end 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.409
 at the third twenty seven groups of students from the faculty of engineering 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.410
 abed peace is an expertise easy it did not know a + had marked a 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.349
 portrait of one of the vehicles because among the mayas in north america 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.240
 thanks to the 3g will manage here and there is a project 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.159
 techniques needed to make his technique great 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.089
 if the tactic finally collaboration with the killer who made a wounded 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.920
 lightweight 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.920
 sAP 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.780
 his death had not been complete on imports our concerts 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.880
 then lyon the period however things start with m 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.270
 in case of promotional anna for the greenhouse effect and in the money at a deep 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.020
 respect mag 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.260
 parts blow up the manufacturing steps that did the same 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.000
 who have not in competition then the month of April and the month of June the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.730
 The main goal is to develop skills at home which is a 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.280
 poor 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.600
 so that they learn so 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.979
 so I think in the curves the spacing project 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.200
 a project that allows us to be very well prepared for the company 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.960
 a lot at the level she works he says it's very important 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.660
 in business 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.560
 work with young people 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 to try to come up with something like everyone else this second chance 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.369
 we have managed the project so we have a project that allows me 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.440
 of value does not take place at the end of life 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.670
 what do we see with a small 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.940
 for a complete finished product 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.250
 the tamponnaise 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.370
 the state of new york 6 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.450
 the initiative 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 the simple act of having to find sponsors 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.210
 in fact it's a bit the same way so that finally business can not 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 get in touch with another company 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.350
 this is surely there is too much with the project this is the first year where 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.860
 what are integrated into the project 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.310
 it takes more for the civil party 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.340
 devices that a girl in the second year to massage local is 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.300
 still a total weight laden 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.489
 concepts like that things go 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.129
 to open the choir is loved by his vehicles 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.590
 finally general after that also the whole issue management for the second the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.120
 third year that scored a lot because after this sector if I stop 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.150
 country if you want you have info who will pay her a little train will 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.279
 constantly 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.209
 I think it's team aspects that we had too much 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.119
 this report 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.330
 we must go further and if in the quality to our shores 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.340
 especially before the competitions where we can think place all week we have 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.359
 calculated 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.989
 poutine are still possible 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.099
 in general we come up well the idea of ​​it is a project that is 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.969
 done by courses in coma no credit for saab 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.930
 at the beginning the first year it takes for 9 years and per person is there a 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.930
 snake around 41 people at the end of what we think of a contact at 12 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.619
 it's worth it 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.379
 if we are very happy to have done 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.369
 echoing his coach 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:01.039
 151 these funds or projects in more total addition to the first to yield 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.479
 killer in 10 finals several in the same boat have the same problems 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.769
 in the complexes with the old ones one can refer to the inscriptions for 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.769
 this city at the academic level 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.269
 other approach is a gift projects to the technique I think it speaks 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:17.810
 a lot 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.800
 zetsche that outside these races does apply to the post 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.540
 of knowledge 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.429
 this week it's wanting that moral person 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.739
 participate in a camp like those of his peers 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.769
 this flight of American calls that realize themselves this case 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.790
 it's over it's a small thing if it was a very nice project 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.349
 the same who made this case this year the trophies for doing this 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.739
 the high-of-seine 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.309
 it 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.679
 one year before
