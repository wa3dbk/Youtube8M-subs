00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you know I thought our defense held up

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.639 
you know I thought our defense held up
great<00:01:55.890> against<00:01:56.790> number<00:01:56.909> 9<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.329> number<00:01:57.450> 12<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
great against number 9 and number 12 for

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.959 
great against number 9 and number 12 for
Bennett<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.159> they<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.399> keep<00:01:59.549> coming<00:01:59.700> from

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
Bennett and they just keep coming from

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
Bennett and they just keep coming from
from<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> first<00:02:00.750> whistle<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.259> look<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
from the first whistle to look to the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
from the first whistle to look to the
last<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.219> honestly<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
being the difference in the game I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.180 
being the difference in the game I
thought<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.720> was<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.380> game<00:02:31.620> where<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
thought this was that one game where you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.620 
thought this was that one game where you
can't<00:02:32.430> find<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.790> way<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> get<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.240> done<00:02:33.420> and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
can't find a way to get it done and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.650 
can't find a way to get it done and
unfortunately<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.650> uh<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.150> last<00:02:36.390> one

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
unfortunately it's uh it's the last one

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.240 
unfortunately it's uh it's the last one
because<00:02:36.930> that's<00:02:37.200> how<00:02:37.410> playoffs<00:02:37.800> work<00:02:38.010> it's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
because that's how playoffs work it's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.210 
because that's how playoffs work it's
why<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> love<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.820> hate<00:02:38.940> soccer
