00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the city but 42 and we've actually seen

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
the city but 42 and we've actually seen
higher<00:00:53.820> than<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.659> the<00:00:54.780> highway<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.920> is

higher than that on the highway which is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.070 
higher than that on the highway which is
pretty<00:00:56.369> amazing<00:00:56.750> considering<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.019> a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
pretty amazing considering it's a

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.350 
pretty amazing considering it's a
2-liter<00:00:58.439> engine<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.250> makes<00:00:59.369> 140<00:01:00.119> horsepower

2-liter engine that makes 140 horsepower

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.960 
2-liter engine that makes 140 horsepower
but<00:01:00.869> if<00:01:01.110> you're<00:01:01.530> coming<00:01:01.769> from<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.400> gasoline

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
but if you're coming from a gasoline

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.030 
but if you're coming from a gasoline
engine<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> hybrid<00:01:04.860> you'll

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
engine and you go to a hybrid you'll

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609 
engine and you go to a hybrid you'll
notice<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> most<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> them<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.260> CVT<00:01:07.260> powered

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
notice that most of them are CVT powered

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.709 
notice that most of them are CVT powered
and<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> rubber<00:01:09.119> banding<00:01:09.630> effect

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
and you get this rubber banding effect

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.810 
and you get this rubber banding effect
with<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> transmission<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.759> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
with the transmission when you when you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.209 
with the transmission when you when you
go<00:01:11.969> from<00:01:12.210> no<00:01:12.509> throttle<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:13.020> full<00:01:13.049> throttle<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
go from no throttle to full throttle you

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.469 
go from no throttle to full throttle you
don't<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.149> it<00:01:15.270> has<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
don't get that in this because it has a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
don't get that in this because it has a
traditional<00:01:15.810> transmission<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.070> spec<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
traditional transmission you can spec it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
traditional transmission you can spec it
with<00:01:17.640> either<00:01:17.789> a<00:01:17.939> 6-speed<00:01:18.390> manual<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.530> the

it's a lot of fun to drive so we're

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.599 
it's a lot of fun to drive so we're
going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:28.499> it<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.679> for<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> spin<00:01:29.399> real

quick<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.969> show<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.929> drives<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
quick and show you how it drives what it

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.459 
quick and show you how it drives what it
sounds<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.399> really<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.869> new<00:01:34.079> diesel

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
sounds like and really that new diesel

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.309 
sounds like and really that new diesel
is<00:01:34.649> nothing<00:01:35.069> like<00:01:35.189> old<00:01:35.399> diesel<00:01:39.079> now<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.109> suppose

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
is nothing like old diesel now I suppose

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.709 
is nothing like old diesel now I suppose
the<00:01:40.649> first<00:01:40.859> thing<00:01:41.039> that<00:01:41.819> you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.390> with

the first thing that you have to do with
the<00:01:42.810> modern<00:01:43.109> diesel<00:01:43.499> is<00:01:43.619> dispel<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.219> few<00:01:44.340> rumors

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
the modern diesel is dispel a few rumors

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.679 
the modern diesel is dispel a few rumors
first<00:01:46.109> of<00:01:46.289> all<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:47.490> isn't<00:01:47.729> loud<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.299> clunky

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
first of all this isn't loud and clunky

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
first of all this isn't loud and clunky
like<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.710> might<00:01:49.979> remember<00:01:50.189> some<00:01:50.639> diesels<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
like you might remember some diesels of

connected<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.440> road<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:00.620> at<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.920> same

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
connected to the road but at the same

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.190 
connected to the road but at the same
time<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.459> very<00:03:01.580> comfortable<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.390> for<00:03:03.049> that

time it's very comfortable and for that
I<00:03:03.230> think<00:03:03.440> looks<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.040> should<00:03:04.190> be

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
I think looks like it should be

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.099 
I think looks like it should be
