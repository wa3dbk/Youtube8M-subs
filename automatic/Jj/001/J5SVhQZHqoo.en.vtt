 weeks seemed a little more 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.310

 how many times arrived on time 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.300
 Five times I can never work 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.230
 dragon ball I ca n't get time 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.730

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.310
 forced to send her away 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.780
 and no and that he still doesn't own the balls 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.330
 requirements we are looking for 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.760
 he takes his things and leaves I understand 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.900
 it's not his fault it's not the fault of the crisis 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.400
 it's his fault 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.890
 I already told her that I have a family from 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 feed me sorry but we can't 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.060
 help her ok i understand her respect 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.489
 decision 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.780
 so to know I never told her the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.760
 story of that man who came 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.090
 fired and then in small house 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.800
 a man picked it up once 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.840
 that he went to work and did the same 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.299
 work and was very good at work 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.010
 he always did everything perfectly and not 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.200
 his work colleagues were never wrong 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.600
 they made fun of him and told him 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.799
 he smashed the walls with cars but everyone 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.989
 they knew it wasn't true 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.450
 then the boss loves you this man and so 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.100
 without reason but without reason 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.049
 he says he was fired 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.090
 then the man became angry and took everyone off 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.890
 the walls with the car went to the boss and 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.660
 gave him a blow on the head with a 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.560
 Hammer ranking and hard to thee 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.690
 friends 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.000
 a hilarious scene then shot him and 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.010
 I come home to celebrate the man 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.870
 bought his wife a necklace but since 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.579
 he was a twisted priest a rope for 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.070
 earth and tied the noose with a knot 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.620
 because he was the only one he knew at dinner 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.230
 he the streets of the necklace saying full and 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.180
 she said but that suck of necklace and him 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.670
 he said but sorry at least he is in a hurry 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.600
 thought and she said but it sucks of 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.640
 thought 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.269
 and then he was offended by a chair 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.280
 and threatened to hang herself she said no e 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.400
 he finally said I understood that I was 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.409
 you still love I don't want to hang myself anymore 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.659
 but suddenly someone arrives who said 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.360
 and the boys know where I can try 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.440
 a chair to sit on I take this e 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.900
 cola and cola and so the man hanged himself and 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.239
 the wife told me my husband is not 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.310
 very kind the woman felt despair 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.530
 he got out of the chair and said yes but cabbage 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.979
 it's not my fault you could tell me that you 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.419
 you needed the chair you could tell me that you 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.419
 needed the chair 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.839
 go away 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.550
 and now how I tell my family 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.310
 tell me what hate race 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.520
 nothing got late i have to go back to 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.500
 work it is home what you would like 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.060
 insinuate that I can't go back to the 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.830
 I work because I don't have a job because 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.750
 I was fired because I broke it 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.790
 the company with the car but you make yourself 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.750
 I realize that the nonsense that you think is not 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.750
 expect to get up 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.850

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.640

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.830
 way to go did not want to use it 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.760
 because I am too good but I have no other 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.460
 choice 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.460
