00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.570
 hi how about corporation part 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.680
 tectonics we have the taste of 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.040
 present the new configurations 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.560
 of long 80 20 as you can see is a 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.080
 economic and practical wireless reader 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.599
 has its own battery the way 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.400
 that is independent for more than 8 hours 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.369
 charging base to be connected to 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.880
 any pc and in turn a button for your 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.000
 Easy reading CSD reading of any 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.090
 1d barcode by means of this 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.380
 sheet will allow us to enter a mode of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.320
 recognition through bluetooth 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.170
 for mobile phones or devices 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 tablets and even fish would be enough 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.789
 then simply with reading this 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.410
 code to enter this mode and be 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.600
 recognized by our device 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.780
 preferred in this case we will use 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.539
 android with the cell the gene would suffice 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.000
 go to the configuration connections 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.520
 wireless and find the settings of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.560
 blood and the way to be able to enter 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.020
 this configuration and be able to search the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.990
 device if the device is visible 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.690
 we can see the serial number would be enough 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.260
 then with synchronize it however 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.480
 the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.640
 and synchronize it does not tell us or we 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.220
 ensures that it is connected to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.890
 to make sure of this we will have to review the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.540
 device or langre version let's 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.700
 to click on the device when 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.470
 not connected in this case we have 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.690
 the option to disconnect and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.870
 synchronize since it has not yet been 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 connected to 100% let's wait a moment 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.310
 more and if it gives us the option to establish 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.530
 the connection the device will be ready 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.990
 and it will emit a sound in the manner of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.410
 make sure that it has been satisfactory 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.140
 this connection once it has been 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.479
 satisfactory we can go to any 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.920
 application device or similar for 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.890
 do the capture of our codes of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.690
 bars just like it was a keyboard 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.560
 let's open the notebook in a way 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.330
 to exemplify this exercise in the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 notebook we can scan 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.360
 any barcode 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.890
 We will use this example sheet with 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.220
 different types of chicken bar 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.050
 among them code 39 code 128 by 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.240
 mention some 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.220
 now we will show how the reading will be 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.830
 immediate between devices 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.590
 as you can see the reading is immediate 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.560
 is transmitted wirelessly and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.030
 completely independent of its base 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.950
 Now we can use any 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.330
 application on another device to 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 do the capture of the barcode 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.850
 as well as exercises for inventories and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.520
 different options that we can have to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.860
 Next we show example 2 the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.380
 connection of argos 80-20 to any 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.840
 device with ios with capabilities of 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.880
 bluetooth many devices count 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.650
 with bluetooth capability however 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.360
 not all will have protocols 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.660
 necessary to connect to 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.910
 devices up or to the box has this 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.130
 configuration by means of our sheet 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.680
 that can be downloaded as well as in the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.660
 previous exercise we will simply have 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.450
 than to scan a barcode for 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.720
 that our device is visible with 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.840
 our ipod or ipad smartphone 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.850
 in this case we will scan and enter 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.560
 to the way that is necessary so that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.990
 any device can 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.110
 visualize so that it is visualized 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.310
 connected we will enter the settings mode 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.170
 or series 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.680
 in the communications area or bluetooth 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.630
 your serial number will be detected 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.340
 then it would be enough to connect 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.840
 half a click we're going to throw ourselves 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.819
 It is common that in the first 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.250
 communications the communication does not 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.470
 perform on the first attempt in given 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.800
 In case of any failure, it would be enough 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.900
 how to try in this case gives us a 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.209
 error in connection we try again 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.379
 and once we're connected the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.660
 device will emit a particular sound 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.790
 making sure that it has been linked 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.519
 configured and accepted by the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.319
 device we will use again a 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.230
 Barcode list of different 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.260
 types to exemplify it 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.570
 then it would be enough just to enter 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.900
 any application that allows us 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.520
 write text and simply capture and 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.070
 start reading any code 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.800
 bars so that naturally and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.470
 wireless we receive the data in the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.680
 application as you can see this solution 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.020
 it allows us to scan quickly and 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.960
 practically any barcode 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.960
 1d easily and without a camera
