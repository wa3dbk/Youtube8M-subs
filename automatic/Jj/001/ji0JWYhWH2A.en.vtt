Steve<00:05:13.640> Dillon's<00:05:14.030> art<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.390> is<00:05:14.510> perfect<00:05:15.169> for

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
Steve Dillon's art it is perfect for

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.250 
Steve Dillon's art it is perfect for
this<00:05:15.470> series<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.310> I<00:05:16.400> mean<00:05:16.610> this<00:05:16.760> in<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.000> most

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
this series and I mean this in the most

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.560 
this series and I mean this in the most
meaningful<00:05:18.260> way<00:05:18.710> possible<00:05:19.190> because<00:05:19.310> there<00:05:20.300> is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
meaningful way possible because there is

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.360 
meaningful way possible because there is
no<00:05:20.930> preacher<00:05:21.260> without<00:05:21.620> Steve<00:05:21.830> Dillon<00:05:22.160> he<00:05:22.310> is

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
no preacher without Steve Dillon he is

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.970 
no preacher without Steve Dillon he is

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
through minor complaint though if you do

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.150 
through minor complaint though if you do
look<00:05:45.020> at<00:05:45.110> some<00:05:45.290> of<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.440> earlier<00:05:45.770> issues

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
look at some of the earlier issues

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.590 
look at some of the earlier issues
versus<00:05:46.580> some<00:05:46.729> of<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.850> later<00:05:47.090> issues<00:05:47.419> what

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
versus some of the later issues what

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.420 
versus some of the later issues what
you're<00:05:47.720> gonna<00:05:47.810> notice<00:05:48.200> is<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.410> Dylan<00:05:49.220> does

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
you're gonna notice is that Dylan does

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.310 
you're gonna notice is that Dylan does
evolve<00:05:49.790> his<00:05:49.970> style<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:50.540> he<00:05:50.660> kind<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:50.960> loses

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
evolve his style but he kind of loses

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.469 
evolve his style but he kind of loses
some<00:05:51.530> details<00:05:52.040> along<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.640> way<00:05:52.790> like<00:05:53.330> the

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
some details along the way like the

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.420 
some details along the way like the
earlier<00:05:53.780> issues<00:05:54.110> are<00:05:54.260> far<00:05:54.680> more<00:05:54.710> detailed

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
earlier issues are far more detailed

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
earlier issues are far more detailed
than<00:05:55.550> some<00:05:55.729> of<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:55.880> stuff<00:05:56.090> that<00:05:56.300> he<00:05:56.419> does

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
than some of the stuff that he does

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.180 
than some of the stuff that he does
later<00:05:56.840> on<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.470> maybe<00:05:57.650> that's<00:05:57.860> just<00:05:58.010> him

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
later on and maybe that's just him

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.620 
later on and maybe that's just him
evolving<00:05:58.760> or<00:05:58.910> maybe<00:05:59.060> that's<00:05:59.270> just<00:05:59.450> you<00:05:59.600> know

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
evolving or maybe that's just you know

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.020 
evolving or maybe that's just you know
he<00:06:00.440> needed<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.800> hit<00:06:00.890> certain<00:06:01.130> deadlines<00:06:01.669> so<00:06:01.910> he

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
he needed to hit certain deadlines so he

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.460 
he needed to hit certain deadlines so he
kind<00:06:02.210> of<00:06:02.270> had<00:06:02.419> to<00:06:02.510> change<00:06:02.720> things<00:06:02.990> up<00:06:03.140> and<00:06:03.350> go<00:06:03.440> a

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
kind of had to change things up and go a

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.020 
kind of had to change things up and go a
little<00:06:03.590> bit<00:06:03.950> less<00:06:04.130> detail<00:06:04.490> than<00:06:04.520> what<00:06:04.790> he<00:06:04.880> did

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
little bit less detail than what he did

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.490 
little bit less detail than what he did
at<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.270> start<00:06:05.540> but<00:06:05.720> those<00:06:06.200> are<00:06:06.320> minor

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
at the start but those are minor

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.560 
at the start but those are minor
quibbles<00:06:07.010> aside<00:06:07.400> if<00:06:07.880> there's<00:06:08.090> one<00:06:08.240> complaint

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
quibbles aside if there's one complaint

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.940 
quibbles aside if there's one complaint
that<00:06:08.630> I've<00:06:08.780> heard<00:06:08.930> from<00:06:09.080> people<00:06:09.320> it's<00:06:09.680> that

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
that I've heard from people it's that

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.740 
that I've heard from people it's that
the<00:06:10.220> first<00:06:10.490> volume<00:06:10.850> does<00:06:11.060> take<00:06:11.270> a<00:06:11.300> bit<00:06:11.479> of<00:06:11.510> time

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
the first volume does take a bit of time

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.050 
the first volume does take a bit of time
to<00:06:11.870> get<00:06:11.990> things<00:06:12.260> set<00:06:12.560> up<00:06:12.710> but<00:06:13.310> stick<00:06:13.640> with<00:06:13.669> it

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
to get things set up but stick with it

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.460 
to get things set up but stick with it
and<00:06:14.240> what's<00:06:14.810> probably<00:06:14.930> gonna<00:06:15.200> end<00:06:15.320> up

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
and what's probably gonna end up

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.600 
and what's probably gonna end up
happening<00:06:15.620> is<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.250> same<00:06:16.400> thing<00:06:16.580> that

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
happening is the same thing that

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.219 
happening is the same thing that
happened<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.060> me<00:06:17.120> where<00:06:17.450> I<00:06:17.690> read<00:06:18.020> the<00:06:18.050> first

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
happened to me where I read the first

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.570 
happened to me where I read the first
volume<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:18.770> I<00:06:18.800> was<00:06:18.890> like<00:06:18.979> okay<00:06:19.220> well<00:06:19.340> this<00:06:19.430> is

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
volume and I was like okay well this is

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.340
