00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 greet dear friends subscribers with 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 diesel of my videos in this release i 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.440
 tell you about how to make an infusion not 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.110
 less sharpener old hard drive 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.780
 home conditions it's very simple if 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 you repeat my actions to within 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:25.410
 trifles, I believe that to make such 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:27.029
 sharpener you labor will not make us 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.890
 need old don't need hard drive 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 such a creepy drive you can get out 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.279
 old computer either just buy in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.590
 computer store in about three 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.129
 dollar because it has very little memory 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.930
 for example on the roof and hectares do not lie 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.200
 dead weight nowhere apply 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.600
 we have to open the case unscrew 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.090
 bolts and hide the cover inwards and we 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.449
 can see the wheels firm nits on and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 reading head and magnetic block 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.199
 Naturally the remaining contacts 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 first I would like to tell you about 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.050
 the fact that there is a very strong not 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 neodymium magnets namely 2 pieces 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 they are in the magnetic year and which 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 is behind 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.320
 counting head unscrew 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 bolts extract this magnet on a blog he 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.930
 consists of two parts which keeps 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 on the force of magnetic attraction open 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 this unit using a small screwdriver and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.270
 my finger failed so i 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.270
 took advantage of a big screwdriver 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:38.130
 barely opened here first dima you are a magnet 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 in which an iron shell, and this is the second 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.410
 later they can be drunk from the block 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.150
 now at this stage we have to 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.050
 unwrap the disc holder itself 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:56.890
 on top is this 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 iron disk we remove it move aside 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.300
 head keep them here, these discs 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.300
 beautiful shiny 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.540
 now we take the discs we put them 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:19.040
 sandpaper of different grain and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.310
 using scissors this is all 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.570
 carefully cut along the contour 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.510
 as accurate as possible and glue with 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.950
 using super glue to magnetic sphere 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.110
 drive now install our 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.630
 abrasive wheel and check for freedom 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.510
 steve rotation as you can see i 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.070
 I decided to just cut the reading heads 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.660
 fix it with hot melt but I want 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.090
 notice that in this case you are very 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.740
 risk bringing the scheme out 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.050
 malfunction so better just 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.700
 turn the head and fix and i 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.050
 hot glue do not repeat the mistakes of others 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.030
 now we finally install 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.950
 drive first we put a gasket which 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.590
 was on this motors then we put 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.209
 Children's top fix here this husband . 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.530
 Our police chick is already fully prepared 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.100
 it remains to connect it to the source 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.010
 power supply including it me to the power supply from 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.910
 computer and drive yourself 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 begin to rotate 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.730
 you can spend knives spin retiki 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.450
 small details and so on power not 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.070
 I can guarantee but speed up 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.890
 certified by manufacturers 7200 rpm 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:35.930
 per minute so they are real that way 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.800
 we did less sharpener which can 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.870
 do a little repair work then 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.880
 is there to sharpen any contacts 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.489
 and so on here this video to you 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.100
 liked on my channel there is very 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.820
 many interesting other videos 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.040
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.040
 huskies and in between tasks of their releases
