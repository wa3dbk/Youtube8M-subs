far end of the spectrum ok so imagine

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.580 
far end of the spectrum ok so imagine
this<00:02:21.220> very<00:02:22.220> light<00:02:22.640> bulbs<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.050> dark<00:02:24.319> malt

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
this very light bulbs in this dark malt

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.820 
this very light bulbs in this dark malt
