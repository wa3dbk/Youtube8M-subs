seeing little lines of water getting
left<00:01:22.560> behind<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:24.210> might<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.720> out

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
left behind you might want to come out

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170

and<00:01:24.960> inspect<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.409> wiper<00:01:25.590> blades<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.580> make

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and inspect your wiper blades and make

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sure they're nice and smooth all the way

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
sure they're nice and smooth all the way
across<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> any<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.850> ridges<00:01:30.240> or

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
across if they have any little ridges or

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960 
across if they have any little ridges or
or<00:01:30.960> divot<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.460> probably<00:01:32.610> time

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
or divot to them then it's probably time

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.600 
or divot to them then it's probably time
to<00:01:33.030> change<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:34.100> obviously<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.520> want

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to change them obviously you don't want

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
to change them obviously you don't want
to<00:01:35.759> let<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.119> too<00:01:36.180> long<00:01:36.570> because<00:01:37.200> once

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to let them go too long because once

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
to let them go too long because once
that<00:01:37.680> wiper<00:01:37.920> blade<00:01:38.130> wears<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.409> some<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that wiper blade wears out then some of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.819 
that wiper blade wears out then some of
the<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.829> teeth<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:42.290> mechanism<00:01:43.290> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the little teeth in your mechanism can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.819 
the little teeth in your mechanism can
actually<00:01:44.100> scratch<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> windshield<00:01:45.829> wiper

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
actually scratch the windshield wiper

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.660 
actually scratch the windshield wiper
blades<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.369> easy<00:01:48.259> there's<00:01:49.670> generally

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
blades are pretty easy there's generally

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.539 
blades are pretty easy there's generally
on<00:01:51.210> newer<00:01:51.450> cars<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.350> basic<00:01:52.710> type<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.399> has

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on newer cars is this basic type it has

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.780 
on newer cars is this basic type it has
a<00:01:53.610> little<00:01:53.880> tab<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:56.579> can't

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

and then you pull the whole blade back

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.289 
and then you pull the whole blade back
and<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.329> comes<00:02:03.540> off<00:02:03.860> okay<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.759> buy<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and it comes off okay and you can buy a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.460 
and it comes off okay and you can buy a
new<00:02:06.869> wiper<00:02:07.140> blade<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:09.179> replace<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
new wiper blade to replace that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.680 
new wiper blade to replace that
and<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.590> goes<00:02:12.709> back<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.910> insert<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and it goes back on you just insert the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.260 
and it goes back on you just insert the
arm<00:02:14.870> through<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.380> blade<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.040> then<00:02:16.819> walk<00:02:17.090> it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
arm through the blade and then walk it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.530 
arm through the blade and then walk it
back<00:02:17.420> on<00:02:18.790> okay<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:19.849> another<00:02:20.090> style<00:02:20.360> wiper

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
blade is what we have here on this older

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.470 
blade is what we have here on this older
GM<00:02:23.270> truck<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:24.620> kind<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.010> pin<00:02:25.310> style<00:02:26.920> okay

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
GM truck it's kind of a pin style okay

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.290 
GM truck it's kind of a pin style okay
so<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.930> actually<00:02:30.200> need<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> screwdriver<00:02:31.300> just

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300

inch<00:03:19.220> blade<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:23.150> some<00:03:23.329> older<00:03:23.600> vehicles<00:03:23.989> like

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
inch blade on some older vehicles like

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.949 
inch blade on some older vehicles like
here<00:03:24.350> on<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.530> old<00:03:24.709> GTO<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:26.450> can<00:03:26.600> kind<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.840> do

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
here on this old GTO you can kind of do

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.580 
here on this old GTO you can kind of do
the<00:03:27.079> same<00:03:27.109> thing<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:29.049> actually<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.079> tab<00:03:30.350> under

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590

pull out you can see that just kind of

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.300 
pull out you can see that just kind of
pinches<00:03:55.700> together<00:03:56.000> like<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.650> then<00:03:57.650> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
pinches together like that and then the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.020 
pinches together like that and then the
whole<00:03:58.340> just<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.359> rubber<00:03:59.569> comes<00:03:59.959> out<00:04:01.000> okay<00:04:02.000> so

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
whole just the rubber comes out okay so

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.250 
whole just the rubber comes out okay so
you<00:04:02.359> can<00:04:02.510> see<00:04:02.950> there's<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.069> your<00:04:04.459> refill

okay and there's the little locking

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.629 
okay and there's the little locking
mechanism<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:09.049> locks<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.560> into<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:10.010> arm<00:04:10.220> and

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
mechanism that locks it into the arm and

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.170 
mechanism that locks it into the arm and
then<00:04:11.209> obviously<00:04:11.389> to<00:04:11.889> put<00:04:12.889> it<00:04:12.980> back<00:04:13.160> in<00:04:13.370> you
