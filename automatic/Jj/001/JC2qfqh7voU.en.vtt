you<00:03:57.720> could<00:03:57.810> put<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:58.020> bunch<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.590> night<00:03:58.770> and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
you could put a bunch in at night and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.430 
you could put a bunch in at night and
sleep<00:03:59.100> with<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.400> that<00:04:00.180> when<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.840> wake<00:04:01.080> up<00:04:01.230> and

sleep with it that when you wake up and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.190 
sleep with it that when you wake up and
lighting<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.980> hurts<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:03.000> strong<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.900> lift

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
lighting it hurts so strong it can lift

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.740 
lighting it hurts so strong it can lift
like<00:04:04.500> 50<00:04:04.950> pounds<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.580> can<00:04:05.730> actually<00:04:05.940> lift<00:04:06.540> 50

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
like 50 pounds it can actually lift 50

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.110 
like 50 pounds it can actually lift 50
times<00:04:07.110> your<00:04:07.320> own<00:04:07.350> body<00:04:07.620> weight<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.370> yeah

times your own body weight so yeah

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.530 
times your own body weight so yeah
that's<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.930> easy<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.260> think<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.650> even<00:04:11.540> might

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
that's so easy I think I even might
