00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello and today's comic is the bible the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:15.450
 room top sound and if I spoke in Ghent in 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:22.529
 600 pages in black and white but with 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:26.460
 a drawing five sensational work 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:32.900
 all done nelly is even black and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.900
 white with something had fire 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.410
 had conquered the two slaves and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.950
 runs away 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.160
 joining children said that they are not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.760
 works and they are separated a bit 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.440
 more ahead of the story tells the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.000
 history of the two and a half to a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:02.430
 from Islamic culture to area of ​​culture 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.740
 Arabic and faith and everything and I think I am 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 It's a comic about survival faith but 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.299
 teaches a great deal about Arab culture in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.909
 I usually and all the weather he goes through 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.470
 this deficiency it shows how the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.150
 culture is rich then little known 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 the narrative is all interspersed between the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 story of the characters and the stories 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.689
 that the main character tells the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.079
 Bible 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.630
 dodo and habib who are the protagonists and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.729
 tomorrow interspersed with her companies 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 for him these stories are in 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.700
 general stories as biblical stories 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:58.259
 so Mohammed has led the story as second 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:03.530
 coral sensational thing is a 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:06.950
 sensibility and absurd all the text 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.810
 and I 'm not too early, you also have 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.910
 sensations that went well 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.319
 passed the suspension I do not like here 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.260
 in the present it is a thing without words 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.790
 so much good for those who like orc 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.220
 more philosophical trademark themes invites a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.319
 growth religion likes to reflect 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 a little while reading this is the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.580
 right way 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.630
 so there is only one other one here that is the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.600
 life 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.470
 I do not read, I'll probably read 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.030
 Because the bruna was reading I told the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 piano and also she said that details 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.610
 which is very good and I said that I would see if 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.180
 I liked habib I was going to get the vitae 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.120
 or if it was really cool 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.830
 I think it's one of the next steps in 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.180
 victims was that they cover the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.100
 company 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.340
 he did not so dear to us a comic 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.970
 600 pages are nobody sings 49 yet 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.709
 so it 's kind of absurd if not why it's worth 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.450
 it's a shame 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.370
 one of the things that most surprised 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:20.000
 this is how writing in Arabic is a 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.310
 The whole thing is 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.250
 interspersed with the stories with the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.299
 life of the characters with key points 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:34.220
 of philosophy and science and with things like 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.990
 writing and with the explanations 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.840
 I think I believe this to be 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.640
 own handwriting is one thing 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.160
 sensational 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.650
 he will explain you can write the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.510
 same same thing in different ways 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:59.570
 different designs 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:02.540
 this if art is art is a thing 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.650
 so the reviews from size to shape 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.330
 I was most touched very curious 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.570
 and now start to explore this culture 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.160
 non - Western in general because would provide 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.900
 attention how we know things 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.330
 from here and west america with things 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.739
 from the West where you are you get a 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.300
 Such a thing you see as you 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.150
 minority and reading this made me reflect 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.530
 a little and made me very curious and I 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:38.390
 I think the role of 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:42.200
 chip format the new phase graph 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.000
 people think so I think the good 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.720
 reading this is something that makes 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.370
 reflect on leaving the concept works 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.020
 with me I think it works a lot 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.780
 People, I guess we have to see this. 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:01.330
 here is one thing in nba bryant so to 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:06.470
 Thrilling story thing 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.750
 finally habib is a fifth diesel is a 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.130
 delight of those who like systems 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.130
 Philosophical Reflections
