00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 good we're all in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.450
 point 10 let's see a mod a mod that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.179
 is to further complicate the game 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.360
 to make it a lot more difficult and this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.400
 in 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 in hardcore mode it has to be a 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.090
 hell good we have a bug 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.460
 ki-moon in its natural habitat 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.169
 our fish let's see this way that 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.789
 as I say put them all pretty 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.759
 difficult the issue is that we are 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.090
 beyond an infection the infection of 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.300
 zombie would you not come out that burns you this 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.280
 every detail plus this of the matter is 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.590
 that now when we are hit by a zombie 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.290
 I have pickman zombies here but I do not 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.360
 I know if it works I want to try them before the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 pressure and when they hit you there is a 10% 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.880
 of probability 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.270
 but he's going crazy walking from 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.060
 that transmits the infection so that 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.739
 you become a zombie then we go to 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.739
 try it right here baby 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.540
 now now I'm infected finds the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.540
 cure says good you try for you 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.310
 to be super slow wait 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.550
 they did not say more thinking started 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.940
 what 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.890
 and I'm calm more or less 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.040
 recordings that makes us hungry is 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.750
 lounes witness banish or fatigue and 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.490
 well I this is what the infection 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.580
 so you know that now you have infinity 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.870
 and as you see it is getting worse now we have 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 two other thing that has the infection 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.580
 this infection is this 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.920
 I will eat 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.310
 no you do not recover any lotion there was 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.130
 but as you can see I do not know the name of any 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.259
 object that is curious and I wanted 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.909
 try a portion of healing as you 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 supposes that it became 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.640
 the next one heals me this is because it came out 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 there, yes, it heals me perfectly now 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.409
 good is that while we eat it seems that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.920
 We received damage was not cure the rmi 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.750
 nothing 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.540
 but well we do not receive damage something is 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.569
 something but as you can see is a barbarity 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.340
 all this and we have to do this here 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.889
 that now you can not see the name because I'm 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 a fan but it is the cure is done with three 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.239
 of wheat two sugar as the name 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.210
 europe filming a bottle of water and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:27.150
 a goal nuggets of these 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.150
 I'm going to put the one that visually 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.020
 you do not see anything if we eat the cure 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:42.430
 As you can see, it starts to fall but still 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.690
 infection cure but in fact we are already 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 normal humans that we have to eat 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.270
 as you can see this may be interesting 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.070
 especially in the way I think hardcore 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.250
 this is going to be so complicated 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.930
 but well let's go here here comes out 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.140
 heal a zombie infection 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.609
 this cart here that if it is not done 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.859
 the same is done exactly as I do 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.930
 said eight ago 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.459
 I did not say it does that I think not but 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.400
 as you see especially the beginning and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.129
 then maybe later 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.209
 man, this is always a space for you 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.030
 you will always have to have it there in case 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.159
 perhaps when you go to lenin down but 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.379
 later on and there is no longer a problem 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.099
 Very intense craft two or three times 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.349
 this is eight every time the zombies are worth 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.069
 priman also serves as just me 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.069
 put the infection 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.830
 now we are in stage 1 of the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.050
 infection does not 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.250
 walesa that the pod does not show person 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.250
 they try quietecito 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.290
 we also get the zombie pickman 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.260
 we are in stage 2 I love that 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.819
 the name is a pass 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.670
 that you do not know what he does because 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.030
 is fleeing from him and I eat the cure 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.910
 of the infection 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.300
 it is very very cool the way more it adds 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.489
 some difficulty 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.160
 that as I say at the beginning about everything 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.820
 then it's the same as at the beginning 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.920
 be complicated to play but good 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.500
 July 7 of the zombie infection 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.320
 good man was a heavy but good 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.540
 I thought the inscription back 1.7 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.150
 point 10 if it was with forge and so on 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.150
 as always and chau
