00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.000
 them what the people of youtube 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.340
 I am there brooks apps and this time 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 I have the best tweets of 2013 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.170
 volume 2 because it had gone up before 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.740
 one and well let's start with the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.769
 first tweet called ai file which is a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.939
 file explorer as what's coming 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.039
 Default on Android devices 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.199
 this tweet has a cost but you can 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.850
 Find it for free if you look for it well below 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.530
 will be in the repository as you will see 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.940
 we can search the files that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.829
 let's have inside our ipad ipad 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.399
 and it's very good I recommend it 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 very much and we continue with the top 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.220
 well the second one in the top is called 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.590
 zeppelin and this tweet what allows us 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.960
 is to change in the status bar of 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.780
 up where it says ipad as you see it appears 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.590
 a little apple tree and we can change that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.369
 for a night mac and windows and so on 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 depending on the icon we have for 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 defect and we can download more of the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.180
 Now we can download more as you come 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.510
 both the icons that he is giving us 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 zeppelin that this is a great tweet that 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.190
 I like it very much to get bored 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.440
 little of the appearance of our 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.640
 device and well zeppelin I know what 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.050
 I highly recommend 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.050
 and we continue with the whole 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.230
 good in the third place is wifi 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.030
 chutney that is a network hub that does not 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.660
 requires a dictionary as you see we are going to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.090
 give in there where it says to scan and how 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.020
 see my wifi network is not detected but we 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.880
 says it's not supported so do not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.880
 we can hack as you see there appears 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.320
 that does not support this network and the truth is 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.690
 very good, I recommend it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.170
 very much and we continue with the top 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.320
 volume we follow you with the fourth tweet 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.800
 called the green tools that is the truth 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.450
 very good this icon as you see at the moment 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.980
 to unlock our device we 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.840
 what we have will appear 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.360
 wanted in my case I put the bronx 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.160
 apps and how they see 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.200
 that's where I said to slide to 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.770
 unlock and this is what makes us is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.840
 create us a direct access knots in 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 the configuration as you see here is 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.800
 they fight and already one time team and I already 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 we could change the name of 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.540
 according to our preference that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.240
 we would like to put in my case 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.070
 I put keys apps and the truth is 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.730
 I recommend it very much so we continue 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.800
 with the top good the other top the other 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 tweet that we will be fine many will 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.750
 call password pit love monk and that this 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.910
 what is going to do to us is that we do not put 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.410
 never again the password of itunes already see 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.960
 that always when we download some 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.790
 application game asks us to enter your 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.160
 password this what we will do is 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.239
 order one only once and the moment 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.519
 that we enter the app 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.450
 then when downloading a game 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.780
 let's go find one for 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.680
 download it to see 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.700
 we go 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.700
 or look for it 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.160
 let's see 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.129
 I think everything is paid here 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.040
 Let's keep looking good is what 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.780
 will do us is that at the moment of 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.670
 give you in download this game only 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.459
 he will appear to us he will return us to 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.569
 appear the box that but we already 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.530

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.299
 written here that bitch that always does not 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.000

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.739
 I had it on and as you can see, 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.420
 is downloading but you are going to 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.670
 appear like this and they will never be able to 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.519
 they will have to put the password in 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.049

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.049
