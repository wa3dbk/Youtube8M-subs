not<00:00:00.690> divided<00:00:01.380> that's<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.580> 12-foot<00:00:03.300> tall<00:00:03.720> snow

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
not divided that's a 12-foot tall snow

not divided that's a 12-foot tall snow
sculpture<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.009> we<00:00:05.310> did<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.730> in

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
sculpture and we did that in

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.480 
sculpture and we did that in
Breckenridge<00:00:06.720> Colorado<00:00:06.830> so<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
Breckenridge Colorado so here is a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
Breckenridge Colorado so here is a
Mobius<00:00:09.360> band<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:10.349> makes<00:00:11.210> three<00:00:12.210> twists<00:00:13.049> okay

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
Mobius band that makes three twists okay

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.609 
Mobius band that makes three twists okay
by<00:00:14.429> itself<00:00:14.900> you<00:00:15.900> know<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.080> don't<00:00:16.199> care<00:00:16.470> about

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
by itself you know we don't care about

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.560 
by itself you know we don't care about
the<00:00:16.920> shape<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> Mobius<00:00:17.699> band<00:00:17.730> by<00:00:18.029> itself<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the shape the Mobius band by itself is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.060 
the shape the Mobius band by itself is
really<00:00:19.020> no<00:00:19.199> different<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> mathematician

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
really no different to a mathematician

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.130 
really no different to a mathematician
than<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.760> rubber<00:00:20.939> band<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.930> loop

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
than the rubber band it's just a loop

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.689 
than the rubber band it's just a loop
okay<00:00:22.619> we're<00:00:23.010> not<00:00:23.100> looking<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
okay we're not looking at the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.009 
okay we're not looking at the
cross-section<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> whether<00:00:24.840> it's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
cross-section and the whether it's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
cross-section and the whether it's
twisted<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.189> they're<00:00:26.640> looking

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
twisted or not it's just they're looking

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
twisted or not it's just they're looking
at<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> center<00:00:27.480> line<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.380> nut<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
at the center line of the nut that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
at the center line of the nut that
defines<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> nut<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.849> once<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
defines the nut but once you take the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
defines the nut but once you take the
mobi<00:00:30.900> span<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> split<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.949> down<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
mobi span and you split it down the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.690 
mobi span and you split it down the
middle<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.759> becomes<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.329> knot<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:35.010> happens

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
middle it becomes a knot now it happens

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.930 
middle it becomes a knot now it happens
to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.480> trefoil<00:00:37.110> knot<00:00:37.370> because<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to be a trefoil knot because now if you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.750 
to be a trefoil knot because now if you
have<00:00:39.360> these<00:00:39.600> strands<00:00:40.260> being<00:00:40.620> nice<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.340> soft

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
have these strands being nice and soft

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
have these strands being nice and soft
you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.120> move<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.510> around<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.500> would

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you can move them around and they would

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
you can move them around and they would
be<00:00:43.770> interlinked<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.370> exactly<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> same<00:00:45.090> way

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
be interlinked in exactly the same way

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.299 
be interlinked in exactly the same way
as<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.840> copper<00:00:46.170> structure<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.129> only

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
as this copper structure if it's only

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.940 
as this copper structure if it's only
singly<00:00:47.789> twisted<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.450> will<00:00:48.840> simply<00:00:49.170> open<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.680> in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
singly twisted it will simply open up in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130 
singly twisted it will simply open up in
a<00:00:50.039> loop<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.610> twice<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> size<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a loop that's twice the size and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.170 
a loop that's twice the size and
actually<00:00:52.500> has<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> full<00:00:53.039> twist<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
actually has a full twist in it so it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.790 
actually has a full twist in it so it
depends<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:54.930> twist<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
depends on how much twist it is if the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
depends on how much twist it is if the
mobis<00:00:56.640> band<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> even<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.420> twisted<00:00:57.660> like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
mobis band is even more twisted like

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
mobis band is even more twisted like
five<00:00:58.680> times<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.579> may<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.300> other<00:01:00.629> knot

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
five times you may get this other knot

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
five times you may get this other knot
that<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.289> had<00:01:01.559> labeled<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.129> five<00:01:02.670> sub<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.210> or

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that we had labeled as five sub one or

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.149 
that we had labeled as five sub one or
something<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.260> seal<00:01:04.530> gives<00:01:04.979> an

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
something like that which seal gives an

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
something like that which seal gives an
ever<00:01:05.369> more<00:01:05.460> coiling<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.990> same<00:01:07.200> thing<00:01:07.229> we

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
ever more coiling of that same thing we

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.910 
ever more coiling of that same thing we
started<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.360> trefoil<00:01:10.110> knot<00:01:10.290> now<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
started out with a trefoil knot now and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.330 
started out with a trefoil knot now and
so<00:01:12.140> here<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:14.869> roughly<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.680> trefoil<00:01:17.280> knot<00:01:17.600> and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
so here is roughly a trefoil knot and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.999 
so here is roughly a trefoil knot and
then<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.729> split<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.720> trefoil<00:01:22.320> knot<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
then we split this trefoil knot down the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.210 
then we split this trefoil knot down the
middle<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.119> happens<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.799> trifle

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
middle because it happens in this trifle

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
middle because it happens in this trifle
not<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.259> möbius<00:01:29.250> structure<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.299> let

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
not to be of a möbius structure so let

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.179 
not to be of a möbius structure so let
me<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.680> show<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> two

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
me back up a little bit and show you two

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
me back up a little bit and show you two

you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:37.829> trefoil<00:01:38.400> standing<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.090> its<00:01:39.270> own<00:01:39.479> two

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you know trefoil standing on its own two

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.630 
you know trefoil standing on its own two
feet<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:41.009> were<00:01:41.070> carefully

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
feet because they were carefully

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
feet because they were carefully
designed<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.500> actually

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
designed so that you know I can actually

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
designed so that you know I can actually
sustain<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.759> they're<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.630> topple

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
sustain them up they're not gonna topple

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350 
sustain them up they're not gonna topple
over<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> difference

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
over can you see a difference

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.910 
over can you see a difference
well<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:48.869> claiming<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
well I'm claiming one of them is a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
well I'm claiming one of them is a
Mobius<00:01:50.399> band<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.090> one<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.360> not

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
Mobius band and the other one is not

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.960 
Mobius band and the other one is not
let's<00:01:52.079> figure<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:52.979> whether<00:01:53.729> this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
let's figure out you know whether this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
let's figure out you know whether this
one<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.329> twisted<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.170> starting<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
one is twisted so I'm starting on the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
one is twisted so I'm starting on the
site<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> camera<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> lobe

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
site or it's a camera up on the lobe

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.959 
site or it's a camera up on the lobe
here<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.439> I'm<00:01:58.950> running<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.430> finger<00:01:59.759> slowly

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
here and I'm running my finger slowly

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.020 
here and I'm running my finger slowly
down<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> underside<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
down here I get to the underside of this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.139 
down here I get to the underside of this
foot<00:02:04.020> I'm<00:02:04.590> coming<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> front<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.000> I'm

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
foot I'm coming to the front here I'm

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.609 
foot I'm coming to the front here I'm
getting<00:02:07.110> around

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
getting around

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
getting around
I'm<00:02:07.740> staying<00:02:08.099> here<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.759> upper<00:02:09.239> side<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I'm staying here on the upper side of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.530 
I'm staying here on the upper side of
that<00:02:09.899> foot<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:10.349> coming<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.280> here<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.879> I'm

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that foot I'm coming up here and I'm

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.490 
that foot I'm coming up here and I'm
back

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
back

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400 
back
started<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.580> masa<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.540> same<00:02:15.720> side<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
started so masa on the same side so this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.010 
started so masa on the same side so this
one<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.860> double-sided<00:02:17.730> okay<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> could<00:02:18.630> paint

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
one is double-sided okay I could paint

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.750 
one is double-sided okay I could paint
this<00:02:19.230> Irene<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.130> could<00:02:20.310> paint<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> other

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
this Irene and I could paint the other

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
this Irene and I could paint the other
one<00:02:20.910> red<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.390> everything<00:02:21.780> would<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.020> fine

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
one red and everything would be fine

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.650 
one red and everything would be fine
but<00:02:22.980> now<00:02:23.130> let's<00:02:23.400> compare<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.450> other

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
but now let's compare that to the other

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.770 
but now let's compare that to the other

gotten to the other side if I continue

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.040 
gotten to the other side if I continue
again<00:02:53.220> sliding<00:02:53.670> down<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.390> being<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:54.959> the

upper side sliding over on the upper
side<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.570> coming<00:02:58.230> back<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.709> I'm<00:02:59.550> coming

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
side here coming back and I'm coming

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.610 
side here coming back and I'm coming
back<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.390> where<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> started<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.200> had<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.500> go

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
back to where I started but I had to go

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100 
back to where I started but I had to go
around<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.920> loop<00:03:02.100> twice<00:03:02.390> Mobius<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.870> that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
around the loop twice Mobius and in that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.840 
around the loop twice Mobius and in that
process<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.860> would<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.130> painted<00:03:05.489> everything

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
process I would have painted everything

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.030 
process I would have painted everything
green<00:03:06.360> right<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.020> there's<00:03:07.560> no<00:03:07.680> way<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
green right and there's no way I can

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.530 
green right and there's no way I can
paint<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> other<00:03:08.940> side<00:03:09.150> without<00:03:09.270> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
paint one of the other side without the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510 
paint one of the other side without the
two<00:03:09.660> colors<00:03:10.320> running<00:03:10.500> into<00:03:10.800> one<00:03:10.920> another<00:03:10.980> at

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
two colors running into one another at

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.350 
two colors running into one another at
some<00:03:11.700> point<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.690> idea<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.650> Mobius

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
some point this is the idea of a Mobius

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.360 
some point this is the idea of a Mobius
triple<00:03:15.360> knot<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.650> took<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:17.010> slightly

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
triple knot and then we took a slightly

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.940 
triple knot and then we took a slightly
different<00:03:17.940> shape<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.540> again<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.739> see

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
different shape of again you can see

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.199 
different shape of again you can see
this<00:03:20.130> looks<00:03:20.430> roughly<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.840> trifle<00:03:22.560> not

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
this looks roughly like a a trifle not

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.759 
this looks roughly like a a trifle not
except<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.420> started<00:03:24.930> out<00:03:25.110> with<00:03:25.500> a

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
except it started out with a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.949 
except it started out with a
cross-section<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.670> was<00:03:26.910> more<00:03:27.269> or<00:03:27.299> less<00:03:27.480> you

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
cross-section that was more or less you

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.960 
cross-section that was more or less you
know<00:03:28.049> rectangular<00:03:28.860> originally<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:29.640> then<00:03:29.820> we

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
know rectangular originally but then we

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.910 
know rectangular originally but then we
carved<00:03:30.420> out<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.019> middle<00:03:31.290> part<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.769> make

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
carved out the middle part to make

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.130 
carved out the middle part to make
essentially<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.459> split<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.150> because<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.049> a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
essentially a split and because it's a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.810 
essentially a split and because it's a
mobis<00:03:34.470> band<00:03:34.769> when<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.980> get<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.220> knot

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
mobis band when I do this I get a knot

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.050 
mobis band when I do this I get a knot
that<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.600> not<00:03:40.019> really<00:03:40.440> divided<00:03:40.860> that's<00:03:41.730> why<00:03:41.910> we

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
that is not really divided that's why we

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.850 
that is not really divided that's why we
call<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.390> not<00:03:42.750> divide<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.350> it's<00:03:43.709> like<00:03:43.829> a

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
call it not divide it it's like a

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.940 
call it not divide it it's like a
rollercoaster<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.390> start<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:46.049> this<00:03:46.890> side

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
rollercoaster if you start on this side

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.699 
rollercoaster if you start on this side
of<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:48.030> big<00:03:48.180> lobe<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:49.019> go<00:03:49.170> around<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
of the big lobe and you go around the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.140 
of the big lobe and you go around the
whole<00:03:49.799> roller<00:03:50.100> coast<00:03:50.400> by<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.670> time<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.000> come

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
whole roller coast by the time you come

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.460 
whole roller coast by the time you come
the<00:03:51.180> first<00:03:51.450> time<00:03:51.660> back<00:03:51.840> up<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.440> mountain

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the first time back up on the mountain

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.590 
the first time back up on the mountain
you're<00:03:53.040> actually<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.579> on<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.120> other<00:03:54.299> side

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
you're actually are on the other side

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.090 
you're actually are on the other side
and<00:03:55.019> then<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.170> have<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.380> go<00:03:55.500> once<00:03:55.799> through

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
and then you have to go once through

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.100 
and then you have to go once through
more<00:03:56.310> through<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.000> roller-coaster<00:03:57.269> until

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
more through the roller-coaster until

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.380 
more through the roller-coaster until
you<00:03:58.200> come<00:03:58.350> back<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.769> where<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> started<00:03:59.390> so

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
you come back to where you started so

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.740 
you come back to where you started so
it's<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.019> one<00:04:01.530> long<00:04:02.220> string<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.660> know

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
it's just one long string you know

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.990 
it's just one long string you know
essentially<00:04:04.110> tied<00:04:04.410> together<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.950> while<00:04:05.670> when

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
essentially tied together and while when

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.819 
essentially tied together and while when
it<00:04:06.030> was<00:04:06.239> still<00:04:06.450> fused<00:04:06.780> without<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.470> gap<00:04:07.620> in

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
it was still fused without the gap in

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.069 
it was still fused without the gap in
the<00:04:07.860> middle<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.489> was<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> trefoil<00:04:09.120> knot<00:04:09.239> now

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
the middle it was a trefoil knot now

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.890 
the middle it was a trefoil knot now
it's<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.890> much<00:04:11.519> more<00:04:11.700> complicated<00:04:12.030> knot<00:04:12.480> how

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
it's a much more complicated knot how

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.229 
it's a much more complicated knot how
many<00:04:13.049> crossings<00:04:13.500> does<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:13.890> thing<00:04:14.100> have

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
many crossings does this thing have

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.520 
many crossings does this thing have
actually<00:04:15.239> not<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.450> easy<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.959> see<00:04:16.290> but<00:04:16.500> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
actually not that easy to see but that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.170 
actually not that easy to see but that
was<00:04:16.739> amazed<00:04:17.040> at<00:04:17.549> msri

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
was amazed at msri

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.030 
was amazed at msri
you<00:04:18.630> know<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> seven-year-old<00:04:19.500> kid

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
you know it's like a seven-year-old kid

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.430 
you know it's like a seven-year-old kid
and<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.340> show<00:04:20.609> them<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.239> within<00:04:21.810> seconds

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
and I show them that and within seconds

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.070 
and I show them that and within seconds
he<00:04:22.500> said<00:04:22.740> twelve<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.520> he<00:04:23.729> realized<00:04:24.150> wherever

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
he said twelve and he realized wherever

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.100 
he said twelve and he realized wherever
we<00:04:25.229> had<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.710> crossing<00:04:26.460> in<00:04:26.759> our<00:04:27.060> trifle<00:04:27.360> not<00:04:27.780> we

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
we had a crossing in our trifle not we

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.839 
we had a crossing in our trifle not we
now<00:04:28.229> had<00:04:28.409> split<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.889> we<00:04:29.039> now<00:04:29.159> get<00:04:29.460> four

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
now had split that we now get four

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.379 
now had split that we now get four
crossings<00:04:30.360> we<00:04:31.349> have<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.620> situation<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.400> so

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
crossings we have this situation and so

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.420 
crossings we have this situation and so
indeed<00:04:33.930> he<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.199> right<00:04:34.379> you<00:04:34.590> know<00:04:34.650> now<00:04:34.979> we<00:04:35.039> have

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
indeed he is right you know now we have

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.339 
indeed he is right you know now we have
three<00:04:35.729> times<00:04:36.000> four<00:04:36.240> crossings<00:04:36.659> it's<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.110> 12

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
three times four crossings it's a 12

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.920 
three times four crossings it's a 12
crossing<00:04:37.770> knot<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.340> by<00:04:38.909> the<00:04:39.360> time<00:04:39.569> you're<00:04:39.810> kind

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
crossing knot so by the time you're kind

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.170 
crossing knot so by the time you're kind
of<00:04:40.080> looking<00:04:40.740> through<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.069> knot<00:04:41.550> table<00:04:42.030> you're

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
of looking through the knot table you're

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.330 
of looking through the knot table you're
already<00:04:42.479> you<00:04:42.780> know<00:04:42.870> very<00:04:43.259> far<00:04:43.590> down<00:04:44.069> there

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
already you know very far down there

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.499 
already you know very far down there
where<00:04:44.550> there's<00:04:44.729> thousands<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.360> different

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
where there's thousands of different

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.960 
where there's thousands of different
nuts<00:04:45.870> right<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.470> that's<00:04:46.830> just<00:04:47.370> one<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.669> them<00:04:47.819> I

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
nuts right and that's just one of them I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.839 
nuts right and that's just one of them I
probably<00:04:48.720> Christ<00:04:49.080> is<00:04:49.259> not<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:49.740> pretty<00:04:50.580> sure

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
probably Christ is not I'm pretty sure

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.760 
probably Christ is not I'm pretty sure
that<00:04:51.090> some<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.419> them<00:04:51.569> are<00:04:51.720> because<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.530> mean

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
that some of them are because I mean

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.080 
that some of them are because I mean
that<00:04:52.979> makes<00:04:53.159> kind<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.520> fun<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:53.789> know<00:04:54.030> you

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
that makes kind of fun you know you

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.149 
that makes kind of fun you know you
wanna<00:04:54.360> many<00:04:55.259> of<00:04:55.379> them<00:04:55.500> has<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.800> these<00:04:55.949> like

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
wanna many of them has of these like

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.529 
wanna many of them has of these like
figure<00:04:56.490> eight<00:04:56.639> configuration<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.419> go

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
figure eight configuration to go

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.850 
figure eight configuration to go
sometimes<00:04:58.020> around<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.319> loop<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.620> then<00:04:58.710> they

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
sometimes around the loop and then they

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.110 
sometimes around the loop and then they
go<00:04:58.979> through<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.340> figure<00:04:59.550> eight<00:04:59.669> by<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.879> time

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
go through the figure eight by the time

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.390 
go through the figure eight by the time
you<00:05:00.270> go<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.389> couple<00:05:01.229> of<00:05:01.289> times<00:05:01.500> through<00:05:02.219> the

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
you go a couple of times through the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.610 
you go a couple of times through the
middle<00:05:02.699> with<00:05:02.849> figure<00:05:03.150> eight<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:04.139> is<00:05:04.349> very

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
middle with figure eight it is very

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.659 
middle with figure eight it is very
likely<00:05:04.889> that<00:05:05.129> they<00:05:05.789> things<00:05:06.120> are<00:05:06.300> not<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:06.690> but

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
likely that they things are not it but

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.820 
likely that they things are not it but
you<00:05:08.669> can<00:05:08.879> never<00:05:09.030> be<00:05:09.360> quite<00:05:09.930> sure<00:05:09.990> there's<00:05:10.620> some

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
you can never be quite sure there's some

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.890 
you can never be quite sure there's some
very<00:05:11.219> complicated<00:05:11.819> looking<00:05:12.300> knots<00:05:12.569> that<00:05:12.840> you

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
very complicated looking knots that you

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.420 
very complicated looking knots that you
can<00:05:13.050> find<00:05:13.289> on<00:05:13.409> the<00:05:13.500> internet<00:05:13.889> like<00:05:14.129> when<00:05:14.310> you

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
can find on the internet like when you

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.640 
can find on the internet like when you
look<00:05:14.550> for<00:05:14.759> something<00:05:15.030> like<00:05:15.150> difficult<00:05:15.990> unknot

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
look for something like difficult unknot

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.709 
look for something like difficult unknot
or<00:05:16.860> difficult<00:05:17.699> trivial<00:05:18.090> knot<00:05:18.270> they<00:05:18.509> show<00:05:18.659> you

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
or difficult trivial knot they show you

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.570 
or difficult trivial knot they show you
not<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.349> swear<00:05:19.680> this<00:05:19.889> is<00:05:19.949> a<00:05:20.129> real<00:05:20.340> knot

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
not that you swear this is a real knot

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.619 
not that you swear this is a real knot
but<00:05:21.539> actually<00:05:21.840> it's<00:05:21.960> not<00:05:23.300> experimental<00:05:24.300> part

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
but actually it's not experimental part

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.779 
but actually it's not experimental part
of<00:05:24.960> DNA<00:05:25.349> topology<00:05:25.889> so<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.219> field<00:05:26.400> is<00:05:26.550> called

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
of DNA topology so the field is called

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.939 
of DNA topology so the field is called
the<00:05:26.879> innate<00:05:27.120> apology<00:05:27.629> we<00:05:27.810> study<00:05:28.139> geometry<00:05:28.500> and

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
the innate apology we study geometry and

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.339 
the innate apology we study geometry and
topology<00:05:29.069> of<00:05:29.699> circular<00:05:30.180> DNA<00:05:30.539> molecules<00:05:31.050> or

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
topology of circular DNA molecules or

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.100 
topology of circular DNA molecules or
linear<00:05:32.190> DNA<00:05:32.580> molecules<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.150> locally<00:05:33.750> behave
