one last time and we'll be ready to go
in<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.570> oven<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.769> an<00:03:28.890> 8<00:03:29.010> by<00:03:29.160> 4<00:03:29.430> loaf<00:03:29.610> pan<00:03:29.910> I

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
in the oven I have an 8 by 4 loaf pan I

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.720 
in the oven I have an 8 by 4 loaf pan I
find<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> smaller<00:03:31.140> size<00:03:31.410> loaf<00:03:31.709> pans<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
find the smaller size loaf pans it

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.640 
find the smaller size loaf pans it
doesn't<00:03:33.090> rise<00:03:33.239> as<00:03:33.450> much<00:03:33.600> as<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.840> rational<00:03:34.500> bread

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
doesn't rise as much as a rational bread

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.620 
doesn't rise as much as a rational bread
so<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.370> makes<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.820> feel<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.030> little<00:03:36.209> bit<00:03:36.360> taller

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
so it makes it feel a little bit taller

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.430
