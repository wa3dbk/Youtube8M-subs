but<00:03:00.859> it's<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.159> fairly<00:03:01.430> useful<00:03:02.319> control<00:03:03.319> scheme

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
but it's a fairly useful control scheme

that<00:03:04.519> I've<00:03:04.730> experienced<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:05.560> problem<00:03:06.560> with

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
that I've experienced the problem with

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
it is when you play with the wii zapper

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.539 
it is when you play with the wii zapper
you<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.019> no<00:03:09.169> access<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:10.069> buttons<00:03:10.400> up

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
here without killing extreme awkwardness
