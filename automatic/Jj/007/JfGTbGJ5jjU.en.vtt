00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello everyone with you hookah 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:09.650
 and today I would like to tell you about fashion 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.870
 called location but d match 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.230
 mod that brings damage to individual 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.570
 parts of the body on the hands on the shoulders on the legs and on 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.000
 other generally accessible body parts with 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.440
 by sky and it appears 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.420
 a window where you can configure the mod itself 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.240
 three modules available this is a scrum module 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.720
 shooting and magic here as well 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.029
 specify 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.879
 teach percentage damage include 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.530
 mapping after killing the enemy and 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.409
 accordingly take into account the impact 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.230
 of this mod with enemies with a player 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:45.170
 Responsibly dream to live and also here 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.469
 there are three sections that you 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.850
 can customize as you like 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.300
 relevant parts of the body that can 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.620
 somehow damage corresponds to your chance 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.329
 critical strike 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.219
 notice the explanation below that 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.040
 critical chance increase 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.960
 the odds of drawing but one hundred percent not 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.680
 means we will always wear this 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.360
 hit 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.399
 also as but does not mean that you are not 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.619
 injured bear a blow physically on the head 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.020
 is it just a percentage chance more or 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.420
 less that's all you can 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 choose your options see here 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.590
 help certain parameters 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.680
 headbone back legs on the same 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 shooting more options here and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.460
 now the only thing you need to do 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.020
 it is to go to battle and now everything is all right 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.969
 you will need to choose places 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.189
 which they beat randomly 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.229
 wedge opponents you can 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.630
 choose body parts to apply 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.490
 maximum damage to your opponent in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.240
 this is a moment you might think that the game 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.219
 became very simple opponents very 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.649
 easy to destroy so the author 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.780
 recommends playing hard 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.030
 let's say the master because in such 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.030
 case the game will be more interesting 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.280
 here is a book getting on the legs of the camp 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.800
 strange I did hit home in his legs yet 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.950
 it is also less worth considering the fact that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.970
 if the handbrake gets into your head with 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.430
 an arrow of many a chance to kill you right away 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.930
 that is, an arrow falling into your head 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.780
 can kill you as well as if you 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.790
 heavy weapons somehow applied forces 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.800
 serious damage that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.060
 accordingly, you have the inscription 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.810
 on the top corner 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.090
 that was hit hard 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.780
 actually you and besides you 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.300
 the camera turns white 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.690
 Still, the light is you very much 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.910
 strongly also by the way can 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.680
 light the helmet off your head too 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.130
 possible option here such 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.100
 simple mod in my opinion called 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.250
 varnish is devoid of a match if you like it 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.940
 you can put his suffice description 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.989
 to the video clip 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.170
 Please note that you will need sks yeti sky 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.900

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.820
