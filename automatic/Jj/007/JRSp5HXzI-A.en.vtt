00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
I've just got to train weird off to this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
I've just got to train weird off to this
piece<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.960> poplar<00:01:49.220> inch<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> half<00:01:50.579> two

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
piece of poplar inch and a half two

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
piece of poplar inch and a half two
inches<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.299> diameter<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.220> he<00:01:53.340> ends<00:01:53.460> up

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
inches in diameter so if he ends up

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.920 
inches in diameter so if he ends up
going<00:01:53.850> anywhere<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.390> he's<00:01:54.630> got<00:01:54.780> some

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
going anywhere you know he's got some

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.469 
going anywhere you know he's got some
extra<00:01:55.200> weight<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> hold<00:01:55.740> him<00:01:55.890> down

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
extra weight there to hold him down
