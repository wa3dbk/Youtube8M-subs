in my house this hot water out here it's

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.120 
in my house this hot water out here it's
coming<00:03:09.500> up<00:03:09.799> through<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.250> bottom<00:03:10.810> Oh<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.980> to

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
coming up through the bottom Oh going to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
water in it and then it starts getting

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.229 
water in it and then it starts getting
cold

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
cold

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.880 
cold
well<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.480> right<00:03:20.690> here<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.079> just<00:03:21.380> all<00:03:21.620> this

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
well this right here is just all this

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.620 
well this right here is just all this
years<00:03:22.160> of<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.400> fresh<00:03:22.640> water<00:03:22.670> line<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:25.420> cut<00:03:26.420> it

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
years of the fresh water line I cut it

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.130 
years of the fresh water line I cut it
off<00:03:26.840> when<00:03:27.140> I'm<00:03:27.290> thermal<00:03:27.650> cycling<00:03:28.600> when<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.810> get

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
off when I'm thermal cycling when I get

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.310 
off when I'm thermal cycling when I get
through<00:03:30.320> oh<00:03:30.680> yeah<00:03:31.610> by<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.820> way<00:03:32.019> I've<00:03:33.019> got<00:03:33.290> to

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
through oh yeah by the way I've got to

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.379 
through oh yeah by the way I've got to
cut<00:03:33.650> off<00:03:33.829> inside<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.340> house<00:03:34.669> right<00:03:34.880> here<00:03:35.180> in

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
cut off inside the house right here in

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.640 
cut off inside the house right here in
between<00:03:35.510> these<00:03:36.019> two

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
between these two

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.410 
between these two
and<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.690> water<00:03:39.129> I'm<00:03:40.129> making<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.519> water<00:03:40.730> come

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
and the water I'm making the water come

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.670 
and the water I'm making the water come
down<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.900> way<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.269> also<00:03:44.510> got<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.170> where<00:03:45.349> I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
down this way but I also got it where I

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.309 
down this way but I also got it where I
can<00:03:45.950> cut<00:03:46.340> all<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:46.819> off<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.569> just<00:03:47.599> use<00:03:48.019> my

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
can cut all this off and just use my

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.369 
can cut all this off and just use my
water<00:03:48.709> heater<00:03:48.980> inside<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.640> house<00:03:49.870> or<00:03:50.870> in<00:03:51.170> case

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
water heater inside the house or in case

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.680 
water heater inside the house or in case
I'm<00:03:51.620> working<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:52.099> this<00:03:52.280> or<00:03:52.610> for<00:03:53.480> whatever

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
I'm working on this or for whatever

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.470 
I'm working on this or for whatever
reason<00:03:54.370> it's<00:03:55.370> still<00:03:55.489> hooked<00:03:55.879> up<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.299> it

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
reason it's still hooked up like it

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.020 
reason it's still hooked up like it
always<00:03:56.659> was<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.379> runs<00:03:57.560> straight<00:03:57.739> into<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
always was it runs straight into the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.449 
always was it runs straight into the
tank<00:03:59.769> but<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:00.799> cut<00:04:01.069> this<00:04:02.049> cut<00:04:03.049> off<00:04:03.110> here<00:04:03.530> making

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
tank but I cut this cut off here making

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.650 
tank but I cut this cut off here making
it<00:04:04.549> run<00:04:04.730> down<00:04:04.940> through<00:04:05.150> here<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:06.250> oh<00:04:07.510> when<00:04:08.510> I

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
it run down through here and oh when I

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.699 
it run down through here and oh when I
get<00:04:08.720> done<00:04:09.109> oh<00:04:12.280> I've<00:04:13.280> got<00:04:13.579> 80<00:04:13.819> gallons<00:04:14.709> okay

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
get done oh I've got 80 gallons okay

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.290 
get done oh I've got 80 gallons okay
I'll<00:04:15.829> show<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.130> this

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
okay yeah you see I got a pressure valve

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.110 
okay yeah you see I got a pressure valve
you<00:04:26.900> want<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.170> keep<00:04:27.320> an<00:04:27.470> eye<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.040> oh<00:04:28.370> you

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
you want to keep an eye on that oh you

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.570 
you want to keep an eye on that oh you
don't<00:04:29.150> want<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.860> let<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:30.890> get<00:04:31.130> too<00:04:31.340> much

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
don't want to let it get too much

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.050 
don't want to let it get too much
pressure<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.750> don't<00:04:32.930> want<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.320> blow<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.710> a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
pressure you don't want it to blow you a

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.620 
pressure you don't want it to blow you a
pressure<00:04:35.060> release<00:04:35.480> valve<00:04:35.810> off<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:38.360> lose

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
pressure release valve off and you lose

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.220 
pressure release valve off and you lose
all<00:04:38.780> your<00:04:38.840> hot<00:04:39.170> water<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.650> have<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:41.080> turn<00:04:42.080> and

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
messed up you you can't hardly start

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:58.510 
messed up you you can't hardly start
back<00:04:49.520> until<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.880> water<00:04:50.060> gets<00:04:50.300> cool<00:04:56.590> okay<00:04:57.590> this

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
back until the water gets cool okay this

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.480 
back until the water gets cool okay this
is<00:04:58.790> my<00:04:59.000> pressure<00:04:59.420> release<00:04:59.870> valve<00:05:00.220> I've<00:05:01.220> got

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
is my pressure release valve I've got

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.750 
is my pressure release valve I've got
one<00:05:01.730> right<00:05:01.760> here<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:03.680> got<00:05:03.860> one<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.520> tank

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
one right here and I got one on the tank

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.840 
one right here and I got one on the tank
inside<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.360> house<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.160> have<00:05:07.460> made<00:05:07.730> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
inside the house and I have made the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.530 
inside the house and I have made the
water<00:05:08.030> come<00:05:08.180> out<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.570> couple<00:05:09.050> of<00:05:09.410> times<00:05:10.540> okay

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
water come out a couple of times okay

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.810 
water come out a couple of times okay
this<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:13.010> lever<00:05:13.400> right<00:05:13.730> here<00:05:13.790> is<00:05:14.530> how<00:05:15.530> I

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
this this lever right here is how I

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.030 
this this lever right here is how I
release<00:05:16.820> some<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.240> pressure<00:05:17.270> oh<00:05:20.890> this<00:05:21.890> is

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
release some of the pressure oh this is

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.590 
release some of the pressure oh this is
how<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.220> release<00:05:22.670> some<00:05:22.940> of<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.060> pressure<00:05:23.120> when

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
how I release some of the pressure when

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.770 
how I release some of the pressure when
the<00:05:23.720> pressure<00:05:23.750> starts<00:05:24.410> building<00:05:24.470> up<00:05:25.540> this<00:05:26.540> is

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
the pressure starts building up this is

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.680 
the pressure starts building up this is
what's<00:05:27.050> going<00:05:27.380> up<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.770> land<00:05:27.980> right<00:05:28.310> now<00:05:31.690> this

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
what's going up the land right now this

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.800 
what's going up the land right now this
will<00:05:32.900> keep<00:05:33.080> getting<00:05:33.260> harder<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.740> harder<00:05:33.800> I

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
will keep getting harder and harder I

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:43.390 
will keep getting harder and harder I
usually<00:05:37.210> try<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:40.330> stop<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:41.570> at<00:05:41.690> about<00:05:41.960> 180<00:05:42.470> I've

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
usually try to stop it at about 180 I've

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.030 
usually try to stop it at about 180 I've
had<00:05:43.640> it<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:44.350> sometimes<00:05:45.350> have<00:05:45.500> to<00:05:45.650> drag<00:05:45.890> the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
had it you sometimes have to drag the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.970 
had it you sometimes have to drag the
fire<00:05:46.280> out<00:05:46.490> of<00:05:46.520> it<00:05:46.730> because<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:48.470> is<00:05:48.680> Tex

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
fire out of it because this is Tex

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.410 
fire out of it because this is Tex
tubing<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:51.670> be<00:05:52.670> a<00:05:52.700> lot<00:05:52.880> better<00:05:53.090> if<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.360> use

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
tubing and be a lot better if you use

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.400 
tubing and be a lot better if you use
copper<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.320> would<00:05:54.710> have<00:05:54.980> a<00:05:55.010> fight<00:05:55.340> alone<00:05:56.410> but

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
copper I would have a fight alone but

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:07.240 
copper I would have a fight alone but
anyway<00:05:57.860> you're<00:05:59.500> this

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.600 

okay<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.700> what's<00:06:08.940> coming<00:06:10.430> coming<00:06:11.430> in

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
okay this is what's coming coming in

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.480 
okay this is what's coming coming in
right<00:06:11.880> now<00:06:12.320> from<00:06:13.320> my<00:06:13.500> tank<00:06:13.770> inside<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.310> house

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
right now from my tank inside the house

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.170 
right now from my tank inside the house
it's<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:15.740> 113<00:06:16.740> looks<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:17.669> a<00:06:17.700> fitting<00:06:18.060> hit

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
it's that 113 looks like a fitting hit

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.140 
it's that 113 looks like a fitting hit
114<00:06:18.930> and<00:06:21.139> just<00:06:22.139> this<00:06:23.070> number<00:06:23.430> right<00:06:23.580> here<00:06:23.639> keep

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
114 and just this number right here keep

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.940 
114 and just this number right here keep
it'll<00:06:24.690> keep<00:06:24.840> getting<00:06:25.050> higher<00:06:25.410> and<00:06:25.740> higher

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
it'll keep getting higher and higher

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.500 
it'll keep getting higher and higher
until<00:06:26.790> the<00:06:27.690> until<00:06:28.280> both<00:06:29.280> tanks<00:06:29.639> or<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.210> same

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
until the until both tanks or the same

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.350 
until the until both tanks or the same
temperature<00:06:33.980> this<00:06:34.980> usually<00:06:35.400> takes<00:06:35.669> about<00:06:35.880> an

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
temperature this usually takes about an

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.860 
temperature this usually takes about an
hour<00:06:37.169> and<00:06:37.410> a<00:06:37.440> half<00:06:38.240> you<00:06:39.240> know<00:06:39.330> give<00:06:39.540> a<00:06:39.570> few

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
hour and a half you know give a few

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.840 
hour and a half you know give a few
minutes<00:06:40.169> to<00:06:40.260> get<00:06:40.380> you<00:06:40.530> a<00:06:40.560> fire<00:06:41.220> started<00:06:41.790> and

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
minutes to get you a fire started and

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.730 
minutes to get you a fire started and
then<00:06:42.000> it<00:06:42.240> takes<00:06:42.810> about<00:06:42.930> an<00:06:43.200> hour<00:06:43.290> and<00:06:43.470> a<00:06:43.560> half

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
then it takes about an hour and a half

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.350 
then it takes about an hour and a half
and<00:06:44.430> this<00:06:45.419> is<00:06:45.570> a<00:06:45.600> whale<00:06:45.900> tank<00:06:46.260> oh<00:06:48.260> that<00:06:49.260> I<00:06:49.290> may<00:06:49.919> I

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
and this is a whale tank oh that I may I

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.090 
and this is a whale tank oh that I may I
put<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.389> pipe<00:06:51.720> in<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:52.050> center<00:06:52.380> of<00:06:52.410> welded<00:06:53.040> it<00:06:53.190> up

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
put a pipe in the center of welded it up

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.210 
put a pipe in the center of welded it up
but<00:06:56.100> you<00:06:56.340> can<00:06:56.550> use<00:06:56.760> a<00:06:57.260> gas<00:06:58.260> water<00:06:58.590> heater<00:06:58.950> it's

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
but you can use a gas water heater it's

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.800 
but you can use a gas water heater it's
already<00:06:59.580> got<00:06:59.790> a<00:06:59.820> pipe<00:07:00.120> burn<00:07:00.389> through<00:07:00.660> the

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
already got a pipe burn through the

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.930 
already got a pipe burn through the
center<00:07:01.169> I<00:07:01.380> didn't<00:07:02.190> know<00:07:02.370> I<00:07:02.990> didn't<00:07:03.990> have<00:07:04.139> one<00:07:04.470> I

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.020 
center I didn't know I didn't have one I
didn't<00:07:06.530> anyway<00:07:07.560> oh<00:07:09.470> this<00:07:10.470> tank<00:07:11.160> has<00:07:11.460> two

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
didn't anyway oh this tank has two

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.360 
didn't anyway oh this tank has two
layers<00:07:12.330> of<00:07:12.539> insulation<00:07:13.200> on<00:07:13.890> it<00:07:14.070> oh<00:07:14.600> it's<00:07:15.600> the

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
layers of insulation on it oh it's the

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.040 
layers of insulation on it oh it's the
sheet<00:07:17.370> insulation<00:07:18.120> and<00:07:18.270> I<00:07:18.390> took<00:07:18.630> it<00:07:18.780> and<00:07:18.870> wrap

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
sheet insulation and I took it and wrap

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.830 
sheet insulation and I took it and wrap
it<00:07:19.289> around<00:07:19.320> it<00:07:19.830> and<00:07:20.240> kind<00:07:21.240> of<00:07:21.300> doing<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:21.600> best

I could with it we know when this gets

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.340 
I could with it we know when this gets
through<00:07:27.090> and<00:07:27.419> this<00:07:27.600> is<00:07:27.750> just<00:07:27.930> the<00:07:28.050> way<00:07:28.200> I'm

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
doing it right now I take this block

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.670 
doing it right now I take this block
right<00:07:31.200> here<00:07:31.350> and<00:07:31.590> in<00:07:32.460> block<00:07:33.180> this<00:07:33.419> hole<00:07:33.690> up<00:07:33.720> it

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
right here and in block this hole up it

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.990 
right here and in block this hole up it
this<00:07:35.430> is<00:07:35.669> not<00:07:35.820> permanent<00:07:36.180> I<00:07:36.479> just<00:07:36.720> wanted<00:07:37.020> to

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
this is not permanent I just wanted to

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.469 
this is not permanent I just wanted to
make<00:07:39.000> the<00:07:39.150> video<00:07:39.510> before<00:07:39.810> I<00:07:44.120> make<00:07:45.120> the<00:07:45.240> thing

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 
make the video before I make the thing

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.150 
make the video before I make the thing
where<00:07:45.690> you<00:07:45.720> can't<00:07:46.050> even<00:07:46.200> hardly<00:07:46.320> I<00:07:46.650> recognize

where you can't even hardly I recognize
it<00:07:47.340> off<00:07:49.729> this<00:07:51.229> meena<00:07:52.229> bucket<00:07:52.710> cooler<00:07:52.979> I<00:07:54.050> take

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.050 
it off this meena bucket cooler I take

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.900 
it off this meena bucket cooler I take
the<00:07:55.229> stack<00:07:55.800> off<00:07:56.419> and<00:07:57.419> I<00:07:57.750> put<00:07:57.990> this<00:07:58.460> in<00:07:59.460> a<00:07:59.490> bucket

00:07:59.900 --> 00:07:59.910 
the stack off and I put this in a bucket

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.180 
the stack off and I put this in a bucket
on<00:08:00.000> top<00:08:00.270> of<00:08:00.510> it<00:08:00.690> and<00:08:02.389> it<00:08:03.389> helps<00:08:03.900> keep<00:08:04.770> the<00:08:04.950> water

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.190 
on top of it and it helps keep the water

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.159 
on top of it and it helps keep the water
hot

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:09.169 

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:12.610 

you<00:08:10.169> can<00:08:10.350> keep<00:08:10.530> your<00:08:10.770> water<00:08:11.460> heater<00:08:11.760> turned<00:08:12.120> on

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:12.620 
you can keep your water heater turned on

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.350 
you can keep your water heater turned on
it<00:08:13.620> probably<00:08:14.039> it<00:08:14.160> won't<00:08:14.310> never<00:08:14.580> come<00:08:14.700> on<00:08:15.120> when

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.050 
you've got 175 180 degree water in it

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.939 
you've got 175 180 degree water in it
until<00:08:20.500> it<00:08:20.680> gets<00:08:21.120> go<00:08:22.410> until<00:08:23.410> the<00:08:23.530> water<00:08:23.740> gets

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:23.949 
until it gets go until the water gets

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:26.969 
until it gets go until the water gets
cold<00:08:24.340> but<00:08:24.610> uh<00:08:24.870> if<00:08:25.870> you<00:08:26.080> just<00:08:26.289> do<00:08:26.530> this<00:08:26.710> two

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 
this off I still got the therm aside

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.790 
this off I still got the therm aside
from<00:09:16.480> valves<00:09:16.990> on<00:09:17.170> open<00:09:17.890> oh<00:09:19.470> this<00:09:20.470> is<00:09:20.680> the

cut this this off and open this up and

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.180 
cut this this off and open this up and
start<00:10:23.770> bringing<00:10:24.010> in<00:10:24.250> fresh<00:10:24.490> water<00:10:25.950> and<00:10:26.950> then

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.190 
start bringing in fresh water and then

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.920 
start bringing in fresh water and then
off

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:28.930 
off

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.650 
off
close<00:10:29.930> this<00:10:30.140> top<00:10:30.440> line<00:10:30.680> close<00:10:31.640> this<00:10:31.820> off<00:10:32.030> and

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:32.660 
close this top line close this off and

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.790 
close this top line close this off and
open<00:10:33.020> this<00:10:33.140> enough<00:10:34.000> and<00:10:35.140> I've<00:10:36.140> been<00:10:36.440> relieve

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 
open this enough and I've been relieve

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.460 
open this enough and I've been relieve
the<00:10:36.950> pressure<00:10:37.220> on<00:10:37.490> this<00:10:37.730> about<00:10:37.910> of<00:10:38.470> three

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:39.470 
the pressure on this about of three

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.650 
the pressure on this about of three
times<00:10:42.310> and<00:10:43.310> really<00:10:43.550> the<00:10:43.790> best<00:10:43.970> way<00:10:44.210> this<00:10:44.510> is

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:44.660 
times and really the best way this is

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.990 
times and really the best way this is
hooked<00:10:45.140> into<00:10:45.350> the<00:10:45.620> plumbing<00:10:46.040> so<00:10:46.190> the<00:10:47.180> best<00:10:47.390> way

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 
hooked into the plumbing so the best way

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.570 
hooked into the plumbing so the best way
is<00:10:50.000> to<00:10:50.060> go<00:10:50.390> in<00:10:50.540> the<00:10:50.660> house<00:10:50.840> and<00:10:51.220> open<00:10:52.220> the<00:10:52.340> sink

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:52.580 
is to go in the house and open the sink

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.340 
is to go in the house and open the sink
for<00:10:52.670> a<00:10:52.880> second<00:10:53.860> well<00:10:54.860> for<00:10:55.280> about<00:10:55.370> five<00:10:55.700> seconds

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.350 
for a second well for about five seconds

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.190 
for a second well for about five seconds
and<00:10:57.350> keep<00:10:57.980> the<00:10:58.100> pressure<00:10:58.400> off<00:10:58.870> this<00:10:59.870> tank

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 
and keep the pressure off this tank

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.160 
and keep the pressure off this tank
right<00:11:00.380> here<00:11:00.440> and<00:11:01.300> it<00:11:02.300> ain't<00:11:02.540> in<00:11:02.720> real<00:11:02.930> good

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.170 
right here and it ain't in real good

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.250 
right here and it ain't in real good
shape<00:11:03.230> but<00:11:03.740> uh<00:11:04.540> anyway<00:11:05.540> I<00:11:05.570> got<00:11:05.780> something<00:11:06.140> up

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.190 
don't run to the sinks and everything

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.540 
don't run to the sinks and everything
like<00:11:37.430> the<00:11:37.580> other<00:11:37.730> thing<00:11:38.060> does<00:11:38.920> but<00:11:39.920> uh<00:11:39.950> just

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:40.550
