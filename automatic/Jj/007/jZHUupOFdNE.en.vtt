00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.179 
it has a really great effect these
things<00:00:20.519> aren't<00:00:20.789> cheap<00:00:21.349> they're<00:00:22.349> built<00:00:22.769> very

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
things aren't cheap they're built very

well it's a really great effect a lots
of<00:00:25.919> great<00:00:26.069> features<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.609> well<00:00:27.319> see<00:00:28.319> on<00:00:28.409> the

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
of great features as well see on the

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.559 
of great features as well see on the
back<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.919> there's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.210> couple<00:00:30.359> different

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:30.569 
back here there's a couple different

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.600 
back here there's a couple different
things<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:31.319> sound<00:00:31.649> sensitivity<00:00:32.189> knob

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
things there's sound sensitivity knob

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.930 
things there's sound sensitivity knob
and<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.870> sound<00:00:34.350> activated<00:00:34.620> mode<00:00:35.220> it's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and it's got sound activated mode it's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.560 
and it's got sound activated mode it's
also<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.330> automatic<00:00:37.640> there's<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
also got automatic there's also that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
also got automatic there's also that
thing<00:00:39.810> down<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.170> bottom<00:00:40.440> corner<00:00:40.650> there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
thing down the bottom corner there

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.910 
thing down the bottom corner there
there's<00:00:41.820> become<00:00:42.480> daisy<00:00:42.690> chain<00:00:43.080> up<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.500> 50<00:00:43.830> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
there's become daisy chain up to 50 of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.620 
there's become daisy chain up to 50 of
these<00:00:44.040> together<00:00:44.280> they're<00:00:44.790> extremely<00:00:45.270> low

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
these together they're extremely low

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.110 
these together they're extremely low
power<00:00:46.020> consumption<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.790> makes<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
power consumption so that makes that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.110 
power consumption so that makes that
possible<00:00:49.370> when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> gaze<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> chain<00:00:50.940> them

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
possible when you gaze to chain them

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
possible when you gaze to chain them
together<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.750> doesn't<00:00:52.650> actually<00:00:52.829> link<00:00:53.430> them

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
together it doesn't actually link them

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.810 
together it doesn't actually link them
so<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.540> confused<00:00:54.690> by<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.550> if<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so don't get confused by that if you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
so don't get confused by that if you
have<00:00:57.420> them<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.800> daisy<00:00:58.800> chained<00:00:59.130> up<00:00:59.310> together

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
have them all daisy chained up together

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.390 
have them all daisy chained up together
there<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.170> they're<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.320> automatic<00:01:01.920> mode<00:01:01.950> and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
there and they're in automatic mode and

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.969 
there and they're in automatic mode and
you<00:01:02.579> turn<00:01:02.790> them<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you turn them all on at the same time so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.849 
you turn them all on at the same time so
just<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.759> plug<00:01:06.560> everything<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.829> change

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:07.859 
just the one plug everything will change

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.849 
just the one plug everything will change
together<00:01:08.399> but<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.780> they're<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.289> day<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> chain

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
together but if they're all day to chain

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.319 
together but if they're all day to chain
together<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:11.399> have<00:01:11.579> it<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.819> sound<00:01:12.090> activated

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
together and have it in sound activated

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.480 
together and have it in sound activated
mode<00:01:12.899> they'll<00:01:13.439> eventually<00:01:13.649> get<00:01:14.069> out<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.310> time

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
mode they'll eventually get out of time

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
mode they'll eventually get out of time
and<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:14.999> see<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> together<00:01:15.539> so<00:01:15.840> keep

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and they don't see it together so keep

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.330 
and they don't see it together so keep
that<00:01:16.289> in<00:01:16.469> mind<00:01:17.749> like<00:01:18.749> I<00:01:18.869> said<00:01:18.929> these<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.340> very

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that in mind like I said these are very

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.889 
that in mind like I said these are very
good<00:01:20.549> light<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:20.999> very<00:01:21.090> happy<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.600> them

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
good light so I'm very happy with them

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.410 
good light so I'm very happy with them
they're<00:01:22.530> nice<00:01:22.889> and<00:01:23.069> contact<00:01:23.399> not<00:01:23.969> very<00:01:24.210> big

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
they're nice and contact not very big

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.980

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
very light I need you to transport hide

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.889 
very light I need you to transport hide
away<00:01:28.139> somewhere<00:01:28.969> they're<00:01:29.969> much<00:01:30.329> smaller<00:01:30.569> than

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
away somewhere they're much smaller than

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.020 
away somewhere they're much smaller than
they<00:01:31.139> look<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:31.889> actually<00:01:32.219> much

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they look here and there actually much

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
they look here and there actually much
smaller<00:01:33.329> than<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.569> thought<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.109> first<00:01:34.139> got

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
smaller than I thought when I first got

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.179 
smaller than I thought when I first got
them<00:01:35.359> but<00:01:36.359> they're<00:01:36.630> actually<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.259> nice

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
them but they're actually really nice

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.160 
them but they're actually really nice
size<00:01:38.459> now<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.689> I've<00:01:39.780> taken<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.319> look<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
size now that I've taken a look at it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.120 
size now that I've taken a look at it
slight

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
slight

00:01:44.130 --> 00:02:25.440 
slight
I'll<00:01:44.490> show<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.570> do

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.120

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
well there you go I've seen kind of a

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.850 
well there you go I've seen kind of a
bit<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.520> those<00:02:28.760> things<00:02:29.120> can<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.860> pretty

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
bit of what those things can do pretty

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.150 
bit of what those things can do pretty
impressive<00:02:31.010> they're<00:02:31.850> very<00:02:32.570> bright<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.470> had

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
impressive they're very bright that had

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460 
impressive they're very bright that had
a<00:02:34.190> full<00:02:34.640> daylight<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.540> didn't<00:02:36.230> wait<00:02:36.320> till

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
a full daylight in here didn't wait till

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
how bright their may have wondered also

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
beam shooting back to it so it's really

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.130
