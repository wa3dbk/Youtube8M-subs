shadow Plus mechanism turn this off it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
shadow Plus mechanism turn this off it's
just<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.090> any<00:01:12.270> other<00:01:12.360> derailleur<00:01:12.720> moving

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
just like any other derailleur moving

just like any other derailleur moving
along<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.590> trail<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> turn

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
along down the trail but when you turn

we<00:01:22.890> find<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.700> gravity<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> drop<00:01:24.630> into

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
we find is on gravity as you drop into

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
we find is on gravity as you drop into
faster<00:01:25.560> gears<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:26.159> taller<00:01:26.490> gears<00:01:26.909> you

faster gears into taller gears you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
faster gears into taller gears you
really<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.810> engagement<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.500> solid

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
really want that engagement to be solid

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
really want that engagement to be solid
and<00:01:29.070> quick<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.970> shadow<00:01:30.210> plus<00:01:30.630> it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
bikes doing what they want to do so we

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.380 
bikes doing what they want to do so we
love<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.459> drivetrain<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:18.060> know<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.270> going

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
love the drivetrain we know it's going

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.360 
love the drivetrain we know it's going
to<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.540> great<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:19.260> also<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:20.010> perfect

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
to be great we also know that a perfect

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
to be great we also know that a perfect
drivetrain<00:02:20.850> only<00:02:21.420> works<00:02:21.660> when<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:22.020> bike

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
drivetrain only works when your bike

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.140 
drivetrain only works when your bike
style<00:02:22.530> when<00:02:23.069> your<00:02:23.190> suspensions<00:02:23.730> working<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
style when your suspensions working and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760 
style when your suspensions working and
when<00:02:24.240> your<00:02:24.360> brakes<00:02:24.600> are<00:02:24.780> there<00:02:24.959> right<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.500> a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
when your brakes are there right so a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.590 
when your brakes are there right so a
very<00:02:26.190> controllable<00:02:26.700> brake<00:02:27.000> system<00:02:27.420> that's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
very controllable brake system that's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.760 
very controllable brake system that's
not<00:02:27.720> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.050> lot<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.290> noise<00:02:28.530> is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
not going to make a lot of noise is

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.560 
not going to make a lot of noise is
important<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.940> one<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> major

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
important and that was one of the major

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.780 
important and that was one of the major
focuses<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.380> new<00:02:31.530> same<00:02:31.830> group<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
focuses of the new same group so

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.330 
focuses of the new same group so
high-powered<00:02:33.600> for<00:02:33.930> piston<00:02:34.350> caliper<00:02:34.980> here

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
