other<00:02:29.010> things<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:30.439> but<00:02:31.439> as<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.889> can

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
other things like that but as you can

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.000 
other things like that but as you can
see<00:02:32.129> my<00:02:32.519> cat<00:02:32.849> there<00:02:33.209> thinks<00:02:33.750> she<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.739> hunt

them<00:02:35.069> but<00:02:36.030> I'm<00:02:36.150> pretty<00:02:36.359> sure<00:02:36.480> they<00:02:36.810> weigh<00:02:36.959> more

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
them but I'm pretty sure they weigh more

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.739 
them but I'm pretty sure they weigh more
than<00:02:37.319> she<00:02:37.680> does<00:02:38.030> right<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.299> there's<00:02:39.540> about
