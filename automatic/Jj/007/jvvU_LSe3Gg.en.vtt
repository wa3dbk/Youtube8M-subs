Ashley<00:05:01.050> Young<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.040> lowest<00:05:02.310> rated<00:05:02.610> player

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
Ashley Young is the lowest rated player

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.990 
Ashley Young is the lowest rated player
in<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.050> midfield<00:05:04.200> but<00:05:04.860> he<00:05:05.010> does<00:05:05.250> get<00:05:05.610> up<00:05:05.730> there

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
in the midfield but he does get up there

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.580 
in the midfield but he does get up there
and<00:05:06.180> he<00:05:06.270> is<00:05:06.390> pretty<00:05:06.690> decent<00:05:06.930> as<00:05:07.230> well<00:05:07.380> just

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
and he is pretty decent as well just

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.500 
and he is pretty decent as well just
with<00:05:07.740> his<00:05:07.860> pace<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.580> defense<00:05:09.000> even<00:05:09.420> though

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
with his pace the defense even though

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.060 
with his pace the defense even though
it's<00:05:09.630> quite<00:05:09.780> slower<00:05:10.050> Ferdinand<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.770> village

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
it's quite slower Ferdinand and village

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.040 
it's quite slower Ferdinand and village
and<00:05:11.310> it's<00:05:12.000> not<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.240> bad<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.450> didn't<00:05:12.690> concede

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
and it's not that bad I didn't concede

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.450 
and it's not that bad I didn't concede
that<00:05:13.230> many<00:05:13.440> goals<00:05:13.680> had<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.860> bit<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.040> fun<00:05:14.160> with
