of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.810> nexus<00:00:25.140> 4<00:00:25.320> will<00:00:25.470> probably<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
of the nexus 4 will probably be and that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
of the nexus 4 will probably be and that
is<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.060> i<00:00:27.090> originally<00:00:27.449> had<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.689> sim<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.590> i

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
is that i originally had a sim and now i

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
is that i originally had a sim and now i
have<00:00:28.710> micro<00:00:29.279> sim<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.240> part<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> setup

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.510> door

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
if you can see you got the little door

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.299 
if you can see you got the little door
and<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.160> pop<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> open<00:00:39.620> with<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and if we pop that open with a little a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
and if we pop that open with a little a
little<00:00:41.550> hole<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.300> goes<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.870> next<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
little hole where this goes in next to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.479 
little hole where this goes in next to
it<00:00:44.570> we've<00:00:45.570> got<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> open<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.829> take<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
it we've got that open now so take this

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.069 
it we've got that open now so take this
one<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:52.850> no<00:00:53.850> idea<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.780> way<00:00:55.020> but

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
one and no idea if this is right way but

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.459 
one and no idea if this is right way but
let's<00:00:55.320> try<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.739> pop<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.190> in<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> it's

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
let's try and pop this in now and it's

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
let's try and pop this in now and it's
of<00:01:01.590> course<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:02.100> obvious<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.609> way<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of course pretty obvious which way it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.020 
of course pretty obvious which way it
goes<00:01:03.619> because<00:01:06.409> there<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.830> shaping<00:01:08.580> there

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
goes because there is that shaping there

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.450 
goes because there is that shaping there
was<00:01:09.450> hopefully<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.220> fits

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
was hopefully you can see and that fits

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.160 
was hopefully you can see and that fits
snugly<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.530> in

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
snugly in there so put that one back in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:34.110 
snugly in there so put that one back in
close<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.570> pair<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.600> on

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.000 

so<00:01:34.900> what<00:01:35.050> we're<00:01:35.230> good<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.650> speaking<00:01:35.950> of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
so what we're good in the speaking of
