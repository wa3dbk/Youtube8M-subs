00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.970
 brausepulver is really a compelling madness 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.310
 we'll do that for ourselves now 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.770
 we need to create our own browser 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.090
 citric acid powder from the pharmacy 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.310
 and soda powder from the supermarket 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:39.110
 Both powder giving each in a glass 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:44.510
 with water and stir both for so long 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.579
 until everything has dissolved 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.410
 But powder alone does not make any sense 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.050
 browser 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.940
 The secret of the shower lies in the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.309
 this is chemistry 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.980
 but each time we pour the natron 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:07.330
 mixture in the dissolved citric acid 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:09.790
 and bubbly break arises when 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.250
 natron and citric acid together in 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.330
 water is dissolved then it is whole 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.000
 nice things going on 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110
 sardonic means that they react 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 together 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.020
 This produces the gas carbon dioxide so 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.479
 carbonated as in mineral water and the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 shower starts to bubble 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:45.100
 do you want brausepulver yourself now 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:49.960
 then we start mixing two 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.380
 teaspoon of citric acid and one 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.240
 Teaspoon of natron powder for the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.490
 taste we give a big one 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 teaspoon of jello powder and 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.879
 at least one big phone sugar 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.940
 to mix everything again vigorously 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:10.810
 and we already have our own 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.150
 Brausepulver made now you can 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.860
 Effervescent powder either in a glass 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.860
 Pour with water and let it bubble 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.720
 or eat it dry and tidy in the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.720
 and let it foam 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 but beware 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.709
 actually one should never of experiments 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.190
 what to eat or drink with shower powder 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.890
 is that a huge exception shot and 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.890
 Much fun says your professor proto
