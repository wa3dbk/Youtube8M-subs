00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it's a great way of getting into kind of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
it's a great way of getting into kind of
DSLR<00:01:00.210> photography<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.530> DSLR

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
than that secondhand now the great thing

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.850 
than that secondhand now the great thing
about<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.240> camera<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.680> actually

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
about this camera is that it's actually

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
about this camera is that it's actually
very<00:01:20.310> very<00:01:20.490> small<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.390> means<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.780> can

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
very very small which means you can

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
very very small which means you can
easily<00:01:22.439> carry<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> lot

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
easily carry it around and it's a lot

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
easily carry it around and it's a lot
more<00:01:24.330> useable<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
more useable to just have with you on a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.450 
more useable to just have with you on a
day<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> day<00:01:26.400> basis<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.270> familiar<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
day to day basis to get familiar with it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
day to day basis to get familiar with it
another<00:01:29.460> great<00:01:29.729> thing<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> even

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
another great thing about this is even

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
another great thing about this is even
though<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.350> small<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.159> packs<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
though it's very small it packs a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
though it's very small it packs a
massive<00:01:33.240> punch<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.720> terms<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> sensor

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
massive punch in terms of the sensor

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
massive punch in terms of the sensor
this<00:01:35.189> has<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> 14<00:01:36.119> point<00:01:36.329> 6<00:01:36.720> megapixel

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
this has got a 14 point 6 megapixel

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.160 
this has got a 14 point 6 megapixel
sensor<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> small<00:01:39.270> sensor<00:01:39.780> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
sensor and it's not a small sensor it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
sensor and it's not a small sensor it's
actually<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.560> aps-c<00:01:41.040> size<00:01:41.549> sensor<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> you're

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
actually an aps-c size sensor so you're

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.539 
actually an aps-c size sensor so you're
typically<00:01:43.259> finding<00:01:43.770> something<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.280> larger

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
typically finding something a lot larger

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.929 
typically finding something a lot larger
like<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.530> d7000<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> fact<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> this

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
like the d7000 now the fact that this

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.330 
like the d7000 now the fact that this
camera<00:01:48.240> has<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.840> huge<00:01:49.290> sensor<00:01:49.740> inside<00:01:50.070> here

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
camera has got a huge sensor inside here

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.130 
camera has got a huge sensor inside here
and<00:01:50.490> there's<00:01:50.880> also<00:01:50.970> packed<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> whole<00:01:51.899> load

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and there's also packed of a whole load

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
and there's also packed of a whole load
of<00:01:52.170> manual<00:01:52.619> features<00:01:52.860> exactly<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> same<00:01:53.880> as

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of manual features exactly the same as

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.510 
of manual features exactly the same as
any<00:01:54.210> DSLR<00:01:54.810> camera<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> only<00:01:56.219> reason

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
any DSLR camera is not the only reason
that<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:56.729> bringing<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.090> guys<00:01:57.119> some<00:01:57.570> footage

that I'm bringing you guys some footage
on<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.619> camera<00:01:59.329> one<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> great<00:02:00.689> things

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
on this camera one of the great things

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 
on this camera one of the great things
about<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.350> camera<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.070> my<00:02:02.490> opinion<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.149> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
about this camera in my opinion is that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.840 
about this camera in my opinion is that
it's<00:02:03.689> got<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.140> call<00:02:04.290> an<00:02:04.409> EVF<00:02:04.950> viewfinder

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it's got what we call an EVF viewfinder

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.310 
it's got what we call an EVF viewfinder
and<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.570> stands<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.110> an

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and what that stands for is an

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
and what that stands for is an
electronic<00:02:07.950> viewfinder<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.119> when<00:02:09.270> you're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
electronic viewfinder so when you're

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.270 
electronic viewfinder so when you're
actually<00:02:09.509> looking<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> viewfinder<00:02:10.530> itself

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
actually looking for a viewfinder itself

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.110 
actually looking for a viewfinder itself
instead<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
instead of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.300 
instead of
being<00:02:12.330> an<00:02:12.480> optical<00:02:13.049> view<00:02:13.290> that's<00:02:13.769> reflected

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
being an optical view that's reflected

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.520 
being an optical view that's reflected
via<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.670> mirror<00:02:14.909> it's<00:02:15.420> actually<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> tiny<00:02:16.200> little

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
via a mirror it's actually a tiny little

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.550 
via a mirror it's actually a tiny little
LCD<00:02:16.950> screen<00:02:17.810> now<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> good<00:02:19.110> thing<00:02:19.170> about<00:02:19.319> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
LCD screen now the good thing about that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500 
LCD screen now the good thing about that
for<00:02:19.920> beginners<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.940> when<00:02:21.360> you're

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
for beginners is that when you're

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.970 
for beginners is that when you're
actually<00:02:21.659> looking<00:02:21.930> through<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.709> you're

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
actually looking through it as you're

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.589 
actually looking through it as you're
changing<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.670> settings<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.209> manual<00:02:24.569> mode

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
changing the settings in manual mode

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.300 
changing the settings in manual mode
which<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.110> really<00:02:25.500> where<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.680> want<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.129> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
which is really where you want to get to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.070 
which is really where you want to get to
to<00:02:26.489> have<00:02:26.610> full<00:02:26.909> control<00:02:26.940> over<00:02:27.330> your<00:02:27.659> photos

to have full control over your photos
and<00:02:28.260> videos<00:02:28.760> instead<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.849> just<00:02:30.000> getting<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and videos instead of just getting the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940 
and videos instead of just getting the
view<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.780> you're<00:02:30.900> seeing<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.739> for

an optical viewfinder you can actually

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.369 
an optical viewfinder you can actually

mean by that is as you look through the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.339 
mean by that is as you look through the
viewfinder<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.480> change<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:42.959> settings

a reasonably decent samson themselves do

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.560 
a reasonably decent samson themselves do

as<00:04:38.760> well<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> 18<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.290> 55<00:04:40.770> like<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.160> said

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
as well this is the 18 to 55 like I said

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.790 
as well this is the 18 to 55 like I said
but<00:04:41.820> they<00:04:41.880> also<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.300> 30<00:04:42.660> millimeter<00:04:43.020> pancake

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
but they also do a 30 millimeter pancake

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.650 
but they also do a 30 millimeter pancake
lens<00:04:44.010> which<00:04:44.610> means<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:44.970> could<00:04:45.090> literally<00:04:45.389> use

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
lens which means you could literally use

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.689

this<00:04:45.690> like<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.080> compact<00:04:46.500> camera<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.520> put

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
this like a compact camera and just put

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.280 
this like a compact camera and just put
it<00:04:47.790> in<00:04:47.880> your<00:04:47.970> pocket<00:04:48.150> now<00:04:48.810> when<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.080> start

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
using this camera like I said one of the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.730 
using this camera like I said one of the
things<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.630> very<00:04:51.660> very<00:04:52.199> difficult<00:04:52.440> to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
things that is very very difficult to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.850 
things that is very very difficult to
get<00:04:52.860> used<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.310> is<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.970> EVF<00:04:54.419> viewfinder<00:04:55.229> now

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860

get used to is the EVF viewfinder now
what<00:04:56.040> happens<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.760> LCD<00:04:57.240> display<00:04:57.479> on<00:04:57.900> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
what happens is the LCD display on the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.159 
what happens is the LCD display on the
back<00:04:58.250> flicks<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.520> changes<00:05:00.030> between<00:05:00.270> live

nicely now in terms of picture quality

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.090 
nicely now in terms of picture quality
you<00:05:33.720> get<00:05:33.840> really<00:05:34.169> nice<00:05:34.320> pictures<00:05:34.770> out<00:05:34.889> of<00:05:35.010> this

going to put it in what you call smart
mode<00:06:09.150> which<00:06:09.750> means<00:06:09.900> that<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.200> camera<00:06:10.500> is

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.750 
us I'm just going to give you some kind
of<00:06:13.500> idea<00:06:13.590> of<00:06:13.860> how<00:06:13.979> the<00:06:14.130> pictures<00:06:14.520> come<00:06:14.729> out

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
of idea of how the pictures come out

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.890 
of idea of how the pictures come out
even<00:06:15.450> with<00:06:15.570> this<00:06:15.690> very<00:06:15.780> basic<00:06:16.229> 18<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:16.919> 55<00:06:17.370> lens

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
even with this very basic 18 to 55 lens

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.029 
even with this very basic 18 to 55 lens
now<00:06:18.900> there's<00:06:19.050> not<00:06:19.200> really<00:06:19.320> much<00:06:19.530> to<00:06:19.740> look<00:06:19.860> at

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
now there's not really much to look at

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.550 
now there's not really much to look at
here<00:06:20.099> but<00:06:21.060> we'll<00:06:21.389> grab<00:06:21.599> some<00:06:21.810> shots<00:06:22.050> anyway

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
here but we'll grab some shots anyway

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.850 
here but we'll grab some shots anyway
and<00:06:22.800> see<00:06:23.280> how<00:06:23.430> they<00:06:23.550> come<00:06:23.729> out<00:06:24.650> there<00:06:25.650> we<00:06:25.740> go

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
and see how they come out there we go

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.070 
and see how they come out there we go
that's<00:06:26.130> one<00:06:26.400> let's<00:06:27.389> get<00:06:27.539> something<00:06:27.870> over

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
that's one let's get something over
