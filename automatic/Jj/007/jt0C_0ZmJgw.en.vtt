a computer that's being used in the
household<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.289> me

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560 

and<00:01:01.200> as<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.470> see<00:01:01.650> it<00:01:01.740> got<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.180> slots

for I am putting this some go ahead and
take<00:01:07.980> this<00:01:08.130> loaf<00:01:08.400> piece<00:01:09.090> off<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:09.960> hand

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.980 

I<00:01:16.219> got<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.399> packaging<00:01:18.149> open<00:01:23.450> mistake<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> 4

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I got the packaging open mistake the 4

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.880 
I got the packaging open mistake the 4
gigabyte<00:01:25.170> slot<00:01:25.890> into<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.399> one

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.860 

because<00:01:31.490> usually<00:01:31.880> with<00:01:32.000> some<00:01:32.030> computers<00:01:32.750> are

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
because usually with some computers are

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.650 
because usually with some computers are
like<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.260> when<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.500> buy<00:01:33.620> them<00:01:33.920> new<00:01:34.130> dip<00:01:34.660> when

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
like that when you buy them new dip when

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.020 
like that when you buy them new dip when
they<00:01:35.780> got<00:01:35.900> like<00:01:36.190> three<00:01:37.190> gigabytes<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.820> RAM

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
they got like three gigabytes of RAM

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.550 
they got like three gigabytes of RAM
they'll<00:01:38.210> have<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.600> 2<00:01:38.810> gigabyte<00:01:39.260> at<00:01:39.440> the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
they'll have the 2 gigabyte at the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.350 
they'll have the 2 gigabyte at the
bottom<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.130> one<00:01:40.310> gigabyte<00:01:40.820> at<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.180> on

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
bottom and the one gigabyte at the on

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.870 
bottom and the one gigabyte at the on
top<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:45.830> is<00:01:46.010> D

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.720 

poor<00:01:51.420> deified<00:01:51.870> module<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.280> computer<00:01:53.640> was

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
poor deified module so this computer was

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.380 
poor deified module so this computer was
going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.120> have<00:01:54.270> six<00:01:54.570> gigabytes<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.230> RAM<00:01:55.470> so

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
going to have six gigabytes of RAM so

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.890 
going to have six gigabytes of RAM so
which<00:01:57.390> won't<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.080> bad<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.710> cheap

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
which won't be that bad for a cheap

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.360 
which won't be that bad for a cheap
computer<00:02:00.900> that<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.140> buy<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.530> Walmart<00:02:01.740> even

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
computer that you buy at Walmart even

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.469 
computer that you buy at Walmart even
though<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> great<00:02:04.020> best<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
though it's not the great best and the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.620 
though it's not the great best and the
main<00:02:09.630> reason<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.290> we<00:02:11.040> don't<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
main reason is because we don't have a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.460 
main reason is because we don't have a
crappy<00:02:12.630> performance<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.640> gotta<00:02:14.850> kind<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
crappy performance and you gotta kind of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.950 
crappy performance and you gotta kind of
put<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.590> thing<00:02:16.830> back<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.390> gotta<00:02:18.570> bend

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
put this thing back kind of gotta bend

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.080 
put this thing back kind of gotta bend
it<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.290> little<00:02:19.530> bit<00:02:24.740> okay<00:02:25.740> now<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> got<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.700> RAM

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
it a little bit okay now I got the RAM

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.000 
it a little bit okay now I got the RAM
installed<00:02:27.570> which<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.560> didn't<00:02:28.830> take<00:02:28.980> that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
installed which you didn't take that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
installed which you didn't take that
long<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> put<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.060> cover<00:02:30.330> back<00:02:30.600> on

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
long I have to put that cover back on

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.570 
long I have to put that cover back on
which<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.380> cover<00:02:31.620> yeah<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.070> bend<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.060 
which that cover yeah that bend it a
little<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.380> kind<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
little bit kind of do it like in a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.970 
little bit kind of do it like in a
flexible<00:02:35.550> position<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:37.200> anyways<00:02:37.590> let's<00:02:37.860> go

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
flexible position but anyways let's go

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.130 
flexible position but anyways let's go
ahead<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.310> fire<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.030> computer<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.780> since

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
ahead and fire the computer on since

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:55.149 
ahead and fire the computer on since
I've<00:02:42.560> about<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.770> new<00:02:44.310> Ram<00:02:44.550> installed

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.459 

so<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.760> asking<00:02:56.120> us<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.390> apply<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> update<00:02:57.079> on

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
so it's asking us to apply the update on

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:02.819 
so it's asking us to apply the update on
the<00:02:57.590> bios<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.280> go<00:02:58.909> ahead<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.329> pause<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.620> I

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
the bios and go ahead and pause that I

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.369 
the bios and go ahead and pause that I
apologize<00:03:03.829> for<00:03:04.219> that<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:05.359> BIOS<00:03:05.780> update<00:03:06.200> is

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
apologize for that the BIOS update is

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.209 
apologize for that the BIOS update is
completely<00:03:06.980> done<00:03:07.219> so<00:03:08.499> we<00:03:09.499> should<00:03:09.709> be<00:03:09.859> booting

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
completely done so we should be booting

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.360 
completely done so we should be booting

into Windows with no problem and I got

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.280 
into Windows with no problem and I got

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.360 
score it get gives us this time at least
it's<00:03:23.599> better<00:03:23.810> than<00:03:23.930> using<00:03:24.409> two<00:03:24.590> gigabytes<00:03:25.129> on

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it's better than using two gigabytes on

it's better than using two gigabytes on

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.620 

you<00:03:59.590> still<00:03:59.980> got<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> 2<00:04:00.490> gigabyte<00:04:01.000> module

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
you still got the 2 gigabyte module

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.200 
you still got the 2 gigabyte module
installed<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.770> if<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.070> ended<00:04:06.340> up<00:04:06.430> if<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:06.970> mix

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210

Ram<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:08.020> could<00:04:08.230> still<00:04:08.530> do<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:08.830> but<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.910> bat

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
Ram you could still do that but the bat

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.660 
Ram you could still do that but the bat
well<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.050> thing<00:04:11.290> though<00:04:11.590> it's<00:04:11.830> it's<00:04:12.430> gonna

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
well one thing though it's it's gonna

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.920 
well one thing though it's it's gonna
run<00:04:12.880> at<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.120> lowest<00:04:13.480> clock<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:19.600> only<00:04:19.780> thing

run at the lowest clock the only thing

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.320 
run at the lowest clock the only thing
that<00:04:20.080> might<00:04:20.290> be<00:04:20.580> making<00:04:21.580> it<00:04:21.730> a<00:04:21.820> little<00:04:22.060> slows

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
that might be making it a little slows

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.430 
that might be making it a little slows
the<00:04:22.630> cpu<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:24.580> it's<00:04:24.760> if<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.270> had<00:04:25.420> a<00:04:25.450> CPU<00:04:26.020> upgrade

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
the cpu but it's if it had a CPU upgrade

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.240 
the cpu but it's if it had a CPU upgrade
that<00:04:26.590> would<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.890> even<00:04:27.010> better<00:04:27.160> for<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:29.040> ok<00:04:30.040> now

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
that would be even better for it ok now

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.700 
that would be even better for it ok now
we're<00:04:30.520> back<00:04:30.670> and<00:04:31.090> sorry<00:04:32.080> for<00:04:32.320> all<00:04:32.380> the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
commotion that it was doing earlier but

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.140 
commotion that it was doing earlier but
anyways<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:37.660> lowest<00:04:38.050> scores<00:04:38.910> mate<00:04:39.910> is

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
anyways the lowest scores mate is

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.380 
anyways the lowest scores mate is
actually<00:04:40.720> from<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.930> processor<00:04:42.150> because<00:04:43.150> it

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
actually from the processor because it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.250 
actually from the processor because it
has<00:04:43.510> let<00:04:43.960> me<00:04:44.020> go<00:04:44.170> back<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:46.260> system

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
has let me go back to the system

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260 
has let me go back to the system
properties<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.070> show<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.790> 6

at 1 gigahertz AMD processor that this
computer<00:04:56.500> has<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:58.150> why<00:04:58.360> it's<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.660> little

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
computer has it's why it's a little
