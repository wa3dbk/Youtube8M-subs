00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
want to pull the pitman arm at an angle

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.219 
want to pull the pitman arm at an angle
I<00:01:11.760> already<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> be

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
I already know this is going to be

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
I already know this is going to be
terribly<00:01:13.590> difficult<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.400> pull<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.610> because

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
terribly difficult to pull just because

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
terribly difficult to pull just because
you're<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.150> rust<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> time<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> thing

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you're not rust and time on this thing

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
you're not rust and time on this thing
and<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.850> doing<00:01:18.119> stuff<00:01:18.240> we're<00:01:18.509> always<00:01:18.630> on

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and it's doing stuff we're always on

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490 
and it's doing stuff we're always on
there<00:01:19.049> tight<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> make<00:01:21.990> sure<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.229> pull<00:01:22.409> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
there tight but make sure to pull it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
there tight but make sure to pull it
straight<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.860> line<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.850> less

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
straight and line it up so you have less

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:24.730 
straight and line it up so you have less
angle<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
angle on it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.200 
angle on it
my<00:01:25.740> next<00:01:26.009> step<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
my next step that I'm not going to be

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.039

want it to shoot out and you know if
you're<00:02:27.570> underneath<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.380> crack<00:02:28.650> in

you're underneath it you know crack in
the<00:02:28.920> head<00:02:29.040> or<00:02:29.160> something<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.670> keep<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> nut<00:02:30.810> on

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

the head or something so keep the nut on
until<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.320> pop<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.710> loose<00:02:31.860> after<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.580> pop<00:02:32.730> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
until you pop it loose after you pop it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.490 
until you pop it loose after you pop it
loose<00:02:33.300> then<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.990> remove<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> nut

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
loose then you can remove the nut

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.690 
loose then you can remove the nut
entirely<00:02:34.800> I'm<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> put<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> footman

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
entirely I'm going to put the footman

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.040 
entirely I'm going to put the footman
armor<00:02:35.970> number<00:02:36.300> on<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> whole

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
armor number on there to get the whole

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.199 
armor number on there to get the whole
way<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.890> before<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.310> remove<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:41.030> rest<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
way now before I remove it the rest the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.650 
way now before I remove it the rest the
way<00:02:42.330> I've<00:02:42.900> also<00:02:43.080> taken<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.340> chance<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.970> scribe

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
way I've also taken a chance to scribe

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.110 
way I've also taken a chance to scribe
two<00:02:46.110> marks<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.709> me

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
two marks for me

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
two marks for me
just<00:02:48.120> line<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.990> up<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.860> shaft<00:02:50.130> just

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
just line it back up on the shaft just

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.150 
just line it back up on the shaft just
so<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.260> better<00:02:52.440> likelihood<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.950> getting

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so I have a better likelihood of getting

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.580 
so I have a better likelihood of getting
it<00:02:53.370> back<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.209> angle<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.290> I've<00:02:55.380> taken

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it back on in the angle that I've taken

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.620 
it back on in the angle that I've taken
it<00:02:55.800> off<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.190> hear<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.880> they're<00:02:57.030> cured<00:02:57.270> keyed

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
it off I hear that they're cured keyed

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.510 
it off I hear that they're cured keyed
specially<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.410> it'd<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.709> sort<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.070> hard<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.340> me

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
specially so it'd be sort of hard for me

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.830 
specially so it'd be sort of hard for me
to<00:02:59.640> actually<00:02:59.790> screw<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.239> up<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.750> in

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
to actually screw this up but just in

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.770 
to actually screw this up but just in
case<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.320> scratch<00:03:02.190> I've<00:03:02.400> described<00:03:03.239> some<00:03:03.480> marks

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
case I scratch I've described some marks

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.540 
case I scratch I've described some marks
on<00:03:03.959> there<00:03:04.140> okay<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.100> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> put<00:03:05.430> on

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
on there okay now I'm going to put on

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.229 
on there okay now I'm going to put on
the<00:03:06.050> pitman<00:03:07.050> arm<00:03:07.110> puller<00:03:07.410> again<00:03:08.030> pull<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.150> out

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
the pitman arm puller again pull it out

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.520 
the pitman arm puller again pull it out
the<00:03:09.450> rest<00:03:09.540> away<00:03:14.780> hopefully<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.080> rest<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
the rest away hopefully the rest of the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:27.729 
the rest away hopefully the rest of the
pulling<00:03:16.800> part<00:03:17.100> should<00:03:17.280> go<00:03:17.400> pretty<00:03:17.580> easy<00:03:25.430> okay

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
pulling part should go pretty easy okay

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.650 
pulling part should go pretty easy okay
so<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:30.600> what<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.930> looks<00:03:31.080> like<00:03:31.140> with<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
so this is what it looks like with the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.660 
so this is what it looks like with the
nut<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.959> pitman<00:03:34.380> arm<00:03:34.500> off<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:37.340> took<00:03:38.340> some

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
nut and the pitman arm off I took some

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.410 
nut and the pitman arm off I took some
paper<00:03:38.850> towels<00:03:40.370> on<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.489> screwdriver<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.390> I

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
paper towels on a screwdriver and I

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.140 
paper towels on a screwdriver and I
cleaned<00:03:42.720> out<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.900> inside<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.850> can<00:03:44.970> see

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
cleaned out the inside so you can see

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.140 
cleaned out the inside so you can see
what<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.450> inside<00:03:45.750> looks<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.030> say

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
what the inside looks like I have to say

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.610 
what the inside looks like I have to say
with<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.420> honesty<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.900> was<00:03:49.019> expecting<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.560> see

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
with all honesty I was expecting to see

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.449 
with all honesty I was expecting to see
a<00:03:49.799> snap<00:03:50.160> ring<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.580> there<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.070> just<00:03:53.190> don't

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
a snap ring in there but I just don't

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.050 
a snap ring in there but I just don't
yet<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.940> know<00:03:54.540> yeah<00:03:54.630> that's<00:03:54.840> what's<00:03:56.060> inside

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
yet I know yeah that's what's inside

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.870 
yet I know yeah that's what's inside
there<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.540> still<00:03:57.780> even<00:03:57.989> leaking<00:03:58.380> even<00:03:58.620> now

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
there it's still even leaking even now

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.339 
there it's still even leaking even now
it's<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.180> slow

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.690 

okay<00:04:07.349> these<00:04:07.499> are<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.709> pieces<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.370> one

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
okay these are the pieces you have one

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.080 
okay these are the pieces you have one
seal<00:04:08.969> here<00:04:09.739> metal<00:04:10.739> washer<00:04:11.040> I'm<00:04:11.760> going<00:04:11.939> to<00:04:11.999> put

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
seal here metal washer I'm going to put

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.270 
seal here metal washer I'm going to put
those<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.450> bottom<00:04:12.719> and<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.829> have<00:04:13.859> this

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
those on the bottom and you have this

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.420 
those on the bottom and you have this
one<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:16.259> plastic<00:04:16.709> washer<00:04:16.859> I'm<00:04:17.250> going<00:04:17.370> to

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
one and the plastic washer I'm going to

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.189 
one and the plastic washer I'm going to
put<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.639> one<00:04:17.699> on<00:04:17.940> top<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.840> snap

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
put that one on top and this is the snap

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.360 
put that one on top and this is the snap
ring<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.530> goes<00:04:19.650> all<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.829> way<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.100> bottom

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
ring that goes all the way in the bottom

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.129 
ring that goes all the way in the bottom
so<00:04:20.549> it's<00:04:20.789> going<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.090> stacked<00:04:21.419> like<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:21.870> in

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
so it's going to be stacked like this in

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:32.030 
so it's going to be stacked like this in
my<00:04:22.259> opinion

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.610 

I<00:04:32.780> don't<00:04:33.780> know<00:04:33.870> if<00:04:33.990> that's<00:04:34.140> absolutely

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
I don't know if that's absolutely

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.470 
I don't know if that's absolutely
correct<00:04:34.800> though<00:04:35.160> because<00:04:35.880> I've<00:04:36.090> been<00:04:36.180> unable

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
correct though because I've been unable

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.040 
correct though because I've been unable
to<00:04:36.870> get<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.410> seal<00:04:37.710> out<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.610> don't<00:04:39.270> see<00:04:39.600> snap

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
to get the seal out I don't see snap

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.170 
to get the seal out I don't see snap
ring<00:04:40.320> whatsoever<00:04:41.010> under<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.580> thing<00:04:41.910> which

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
ring whatsoever under this thing which

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.430 
ring whatsoever under this thing which
leads<00:04:42.690> makes<00:04:43.230> me<00:04:43.350> wonder<00:04:43.590> about<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.040> whole

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
leads makes me wonder about the whole

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.490 
leads makes me wonder about the whole
scenario<00:04:46.440> like<00:04:46.620> if<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.920> ever<00:04:47.040> had<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:47.640> it

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
scenario like if it ever had one in it

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.840 
scenario like if it ever had one in it
does<00:04:49.500> seem<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.680> have<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.890> metal<00:04:50.040> washer<00:04:50.250> there's

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
does seem to have a metal washer there's

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.280 
does seem to have a metal washer there's
tons<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.360> space<00:04:51.480> up<00:04:51.840> in<00:04:51.960> there

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
tons of space up in there

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.140 
tons of space up in there
so<00:04:52.950> I'm<00:04:53.070> not<00:04:53.190> going<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:53.580> recommend

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
so I'm not going to really recommend

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.970 
so I'm not going to really recommend
this<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.390> anybody<00:04:54.570> else<00:04:54.900> but<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.500> just<00:04:55.530> plan<00:04:55.950> to

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
this to anybody else but I just plan to

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.010 
this to anybody else but I just plan to
cram<00:04:56.340> all<00:04:56.550> those<00:04:56.940> seals<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.450> there<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.870> then

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
cram all those seals in there and then

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.360 
cram all those seals in there and then
pull<00:04:58.230> it<00:04:58.380> down<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.890> see<00:04:59.040> what<00:04:59.190> happens<00:05:01.370> okay

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
pull it down and see what happens okay

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.620 
pull it down and see what happens okay
this<00:05:02.700> is<00:05:02.820> what<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.000> looks<00:05:03.150> like<00:05:03.300> with<00:05:03.480> the

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
this is what it looks like with the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:13.820 
this is what it looks like with the
first<00:05:03.870> seals<00:05:04.290> crammed<00:05:04.860> in

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.499 

I<00:05:13.860> was<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.669> one<00:05:14.789> with<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.830> plastic<00:05:16.830> backing

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
I was the one with the plastic backing

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.089 
I was the one with the plastic backing
I'm<00:05:18.509> going<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:18.960> for<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.199> rubber<00:05:19.379> seal<00:05:19.710> with

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
I'm going to go for the rubber seal with

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.320 
I'm going to go for the rubber seal with
the<00:05:20.370> metal<00:05:20.819> washer<00:05:21.360> behind<00:05:21.659> it<00:05:21.960> okay<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:24.210> is

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
the metal washer behind it okay this is

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.580 
the metal washer behind it okay this is
what<00:05:24.449> it<00:05:24.479> looks<00:05:24.629> like<00:05:24.659> with<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.020> second<00:05:25.409> seal

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
what it looks like with the second seal

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.589 
what it looks like with the second seal
on<00:05:25.770> it<00:05:27.139> in<00:05:28.139> retrospect<00:05:29.069> I<00:05:29.580> probably<00:05:29.610> would

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
on it in retrospect I probably would

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.899 
on it in retrospect I probably would
have<00:05:30.990> used<00:05:31.129> the<00:05:33.199> rubber<00:05:34.199> seal<00:05:34.889> plus<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.610> metal

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
have used the rubber seal plus the metal

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.149 
have used the rubber seal plus the metal
seal<00:05:36.150> first<00:05:36.629> and<00:05:36.900> use<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.169> plastic<00:05:37.830> seal<00:05:38.009> on

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
seal first and use that plastic seal on

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.800 
seal first and use that plastic seal on
the<00:05:38.220> bottom<00:05:38.370> because<00:05:38.819> right<00:05:39.060> now<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.270> metal

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
the bottom because right now the metal

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.240 
the bottom because right now the metal
one<00:05:39.960> just<00:05:40.110> wants<00:05:40.289> to<00:05:40.379> fall<00:05:40.590> out<00:05:41.900> so<00:05:43.129> then<00:05:44.129> I've

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
one just wants to fall out so then I've

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.830 
one just wants to fall out so then I've
got<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.520> snap<00:05:44.789> ring<00:05:45.090> so<00:05:45.300> I'm<00:05:45.360> going<00:05:45.479> to<00:05:45.539> see<00:05:45.720> if

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
got the snap ring so I'm going to see if

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.659 
got the snap ring so I'm going to see if
I<00:05:45.930> have<00:05:46.080> enough<00:05:46.259> room<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.560> we're<00:05:47.460> different

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
it looks like

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.370 
it looks like
there's<00:07:08.490> Pitman<00:07:08.910> bet<00:07:09.060> armed<00:07:09.360> a<00:07:09.720> Pitman<00:07:10.290> arms

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.350 
there's Pitman bet armed a Pitman arms
pretty<00:07:10.820> straightforward<00:07:11.820> to<00:07:11.880> put<00:07:12.030> on<00:07:12.150> it's

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
pretty straightforward to put on it's

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.420 
pretty straightforward to put on it's
actually<00:07:12.870> keyed<00:07:13.170> so<00:07:13.380> you<00:07:13.560> can't<00:07:13.950> be<00:07:14.070> off<00:07:14.220> by

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
actually keyed so you can't be off by

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.640 
actually keyed so you can't be off by
too<00:07:14.490> many<00:07:14.810> you<00:07:15.810> know<00:07:15.900> more<00:07:16.140> than<00:07:16.230> maybe<00:07:16.470> like

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
too many you know more than maybe like

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.740 
too many you know more than maybe like
25<00:07:17.070> degrees<00:07:17.220> so<00:07:17.700> if<00:07:17.820> you're<00:07:17.970> relatively<00:07:18.570> close

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
25 degrees so if you're relatively close

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.880 
25 degrees so if you're relatively close
to<00:07:18.930> where<00:07:19.050> you<00:07:19.140> were<00:07:19.260> you<00:07:19.470> should<00:07:19.500> be<00:07:19.740> able<00:07:19.800> to

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890 
to where you were you should be able to

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.530 
to where you were you should be able to
line<00:07:20.040> it<00:07:20.070> up<00:07:20.220> okay<00:07:20.580> I<00:07:20.730> still<00:07:20.970> did<00:07:21.090> marks<00:07:21.360> on

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:21.540 
line it up okay I still did marks on

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.930 
line it up okay I still did marks on
mine<00:07:21.720> but<00:07:22.190> even<00:07:23.190> without<00:07:23.400> that<00:07:23.610> you<00:07:23.730> shouldn't

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
mine but even without that you shouldn't

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.940 
mine but even without that you shouldn't
be<00:07:24.000> too<00:07:24.180> far<00:07:24.210> off<00:07:24.450> and<00:07:24.900> then<00:07:25.260> just<00:07:25.470> slide<00:07:25.740> it<00:07:25.860> up

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950 
be too far off and then just slide it up

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.800 
be too far off and then just slide it up
there<00:07:26.160> and<00:07:26.310> bolt<00:07:26.640> it<00:07:26.760> on<00:07:27.380> tight<00:07:28.380> as<00:07:28.560> you<00:07:28.650> can<00:07:28.800> go

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810 
there and bolt it on tight as you can go

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.420 
there and bolt it on tight as you can go
there<00:07:30.810> you<00:07:30.840> can<00:07:31.080> see<00:07:31.260> this<00:07:31.350> new<00:07:31.710> seal<00:07:31.980> hiding

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
there you can see this new seal hiding

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.640 
there you can see this new seal hiding
up<00:07:32.580> there<00:07:32.610> behind<00:07:32.940> the<00:07:33.150> shaft<00:07:33.380> it's<00:07:34.380> got<00:07:34.530> the

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
up there behind the shaft it's got the
