processor or food mill well I'd rather
not<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.510> way<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.570> cook

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
not do it that way because when you cook

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600

the<00:00:48.870> tomatoes<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> seeds<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the tomatoes with the seeds in them the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.189 
the tomatoes with the seeds in them the
seeds<00:00:50.850> tend<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> make<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.600> sauce<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> little

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
seeds tend to make the sauce a little

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
seeds tend to make the sauce a little
bit<00:00:52.350> bitter<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.059> run<00:00:54.239> mine<00:00:54.480> through

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
this so that I could do a whole lot at
one<00:01:54.810> time<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.219> recipe<00:01:56.729> calls<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.240> making

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
one time and the recipe calls for making

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
one time and the recipe calls for making
three<00:01:58.469> pints<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.189> I'll<00:01:59.280> tell<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.700> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
three pints but I'll tell you this is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.530 
three pints but I'll tell you this is
such<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> labor-intensive<00:02:01.579> recipe<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
such a labor-intensive recipe and it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
such a labor-intensive recipe and it
takes<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.960> long<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.890> wouldn't<00:02:05.460> go

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
takes so long to do I wouldn't go

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
takes so long to do I wouldn't go
through<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.210> three<00:02:06.420> pints<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
through it for just three pints so I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.940 
through it for just three pints so I
would<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.649> least<00:02:08.090> triple<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.390> recipe<00:02:09.950> now

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
would at least triple this recipe now

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.230 
would at least triple this recipe now
I'm<00:02:11.190> putting<00:02:11.489> together<00:02:11.610> my<00:02:12.090> spice<00:02:12.390> bag<00:02:12.720> I'm

I'm<00:02:15.610> adding<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.480> celery<00:02:17.200> seed<00:02:17.500> whole

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
I'm adding to it celery seed whole

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.220 
I'm adding to it celery seed whole

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
sticks then I tied together of the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.100 
sticks then I tied together of the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
spice ball thingies that's one thing I

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.620 
spice ball thingies that's one thing I
haven't<00:02:41.830> run<00:02:42.040> across<00:02:42.100> yet<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.240> there<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.600> a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
haven't run across yet so there is a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.410 
haven't run across yet so there is a
gadget<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.530> don't<00:02:44.890> have<00:02:45.220> yet<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.790> until<00:02:49.390> I

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
gadget that I don't have yet so until I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.900 
gadget that I don't have yet so until I
run<00:02:49.780> across<00:02:50.140> one<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.500> those<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:51.370> piece<00:02:51.730> of

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
run across one of those this piece of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.390 
run across one of those this piece of
muslin<00:02:52.120> will<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:52.720> have<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.110> do<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.650> muslin

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
muslin will just have to do and muslin

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.370 
muslin will just have to do and muslin
has<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> lot<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.000> uses<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.900> good<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.230> have

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
has a lot of uses so it's good to have

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.770 
has a lot of uses so it's good to have
it<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.650> hand<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.170> added<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.890> salt<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.220 
for 25 minutes and then I added the
vinegar<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.380> when<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.810> ketchup<00:03:16.810> started<00:03:17.170> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
vinegar and when the ketchup started to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.110 
vinegar and when the ketchup started to
get<00:03:17.410> kind<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.890> thick<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.370> was<00:03:18.490> scorching<00:03:19.000> on

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
get kind of thick it was scorching on

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.940 
get kind of thick it was scorching on
the<00:03:19.270> sides<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.780> pan<00:03:19.990> and<00:03:20.380> had<00:03:20.590> reduced

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
the sides of the pan and had reduced

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680 
the sides of the pan and had reduced
down<00:03:21.310> enough<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.030> could<00:03:22.210> fit<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.540> into

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
down enough so that I could fit it into

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.020 
down enough so that I could fit it into
a<00:03:22.900> pot<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.530> stove<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.190> transferred<00:03:24.820> it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
a pot on the stove so I transferred it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.140 
a pot on the stove so I transferred it
into<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.840> pot<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.590> cooked<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.400> for<00:03:27.610> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
into a pot and cooked it for the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.900 
into a pot and cooked it for the
remaining<00:03:28.420> time<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.080> stove

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
remaining time on the stove

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.790 
remaining time on the stove
since<00:03:30.910> you're<00:03:31.120> not<00:03:31.270> using<00:03:31.810> an<00:03:31.960> exact<00:03:32.440> amount

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
since you're not using an exact amount

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.700 
since you're not using an exact amount
of<00:03:32.920> tomatoes<00:03:33.400> here<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.590> different<00:03:35.590> varieties

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
of tomatoes here and different varieties

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.120 
of tomatoes here and different varieties
can<00:03:36.340> vary<00:03:36.840> you'll<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.320> adjust<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.890> taste

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
can vary you'll have to adjust the taste

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.730 
can vary you'll have to adjust the taste
of<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.520> recipe<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.510> ended<00:03:40.930> up<00:03:41.020> adding<00:03:41.440> some

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
of this recipe I ended up adding some

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.820 
of this recipe I ended up adding some
salt<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.370> some<00:03:42.430> sugar<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.600> because<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.620> was

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
salt and some sugar to it because it was

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.830 
salt and some sugar to it because it was
just<00:03:44.860> tasting<00:03:45.430> too<00:03:45.580> vinegary<00:03:45.820> when<00:03:46.690> it

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
just tasting too vinegary when it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.020 
just tasting too vinegary when it
finally<00:03:47.110> thickened<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.250> consistency<00:03:48.820> of

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
finally thickened to the consistency of

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.920 
finally thickened to the consistency of
ketchup

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
ketchup

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.320
