00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
sense ok now let's read a bit on the

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.600 
sense ok now let's read a bit on the
internet<00:00:50.910> hopefully<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.960> faster

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
internet hopefully this time is faster

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.569 
internet hopefully this time is faster
since<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.909> better<00:00:54.180> prl<00:00:54.720> 61<00:00:55.620> 70<00:00:56.540> 6107<00:00:58.579> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
since I got a better prl 61 70 6107 so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.049 
since I got a better prl 61 70 6107 so
it's<00:00:59.909> already<00:01:00.149> loaded<00:01:00.540> on<00:01:00.839> bakersville<00:01:02.059> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it's already loaded on bakersville and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.590 
it's already loaded on bakersville and
let's<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.110> let's<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> cell<00:01:05.129> phones

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.969 

and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.020> guess<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> did<00:01:13.500> made<00:01:13.679> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and I guess it did made a lot of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.990 
and I guess it did made a lot of
difference<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.940> prl<00:01:16.130> since<00:01:17.130> boost<00:01:17.640> mobile

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
difference on the prl since boost mobile

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.389 
difference on the prl since boost mobile
doesn't<00:01:18.360> transfer<00:01:18.780> any<00:01:18.960> data<00:01:19.350> through<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> 21

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.790 
doesn't transfer any data through the 21
whatever<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.090> had<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.659> guess<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
whatever I had I guess that's the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.450 
whatever I had I guess that's the
problem<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.580> having<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.420> internet

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
