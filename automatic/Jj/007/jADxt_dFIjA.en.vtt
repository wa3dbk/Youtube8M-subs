00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.600 
you can see that there's some clumps
there<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:39.879> can<00:00:40.090> keep<00:00:40.239> it<00:00:42.210> spatula<00:00:44.610> scrape

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
there so you can keep it spatula scrape

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.670 
there so you can keep it spatula scrape
that<00:00:45.850> off<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:51.750> usually<00:00:52.750> just<00:00:52.960> dump<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.320> into<00:00:53.530> a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
that off and usually just dump it into a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.430 
that off and usually just dump it into a
bucket<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.460> uh

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.960 

here<00:01:00.440> let's<00:01:00.710> pretend<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.220> there<00:01:01.430> are<00:01:01.610> some

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
here let's pretend that there are some

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.940 
here let's pretend that there are some
and<00:01:02.540> then<00:01:02.630> you'll<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:03.020> don't<00:01:03.290> that<00:01:03.470> into<00:01:03.829> the

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
and then you'll just don't that into the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.260 
and then you'll just don't that into the
bucket<00:01:04.339> as<00:01:04.460> well<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:07.010> then<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:08.000> goes

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
bucket as well and then it just goes

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.340 
bucket as well and then it just goes
just<00:01:08.740> dealt<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.860> clean<00:01:10.159> letter<00:01:10.630> back<00:01:11.630> into

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.310 

litter<00:01:15.550> sir<00:01:16.550> boss<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.210> can<00:01:18.020> clean<00:01:20.110> every<00:01:21.110> once

litter sir boss I can clean every once
in<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.530> while<00:01:21.710> you'll<00:01:22.100> probably<00:01:22.130> want<00:01:22.880> to

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
in a while you'll probably want to

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.890 
in a while you'll probably want to
sanitize<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.250> box<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:26.600> can<00:01:26.750> do

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
sanitize the box and so what you can do

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.609 
sanitize the box and so what you can do
is<00:01:27.110> when<00:01:27.350> when<00:01:27.710> it's<00:01:27.890> empty<00:01:28.659> just<00:01:29.659> go<00:01:30.530> ahead
