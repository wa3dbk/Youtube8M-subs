protein especially at breakfast so if

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.670 
protein especially at breakfast so if

well-rounded breakfast you're more

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.360 
well-rounded breakfast you're more
likely<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.420> choose<00:02:58.720> higher<00:02:59.319> starchy<00:02:59.800> or<00:03:00.010> carbs

snacks<00:03:00.730> maybe<00:03:01.060> make<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> poor<00:03:01.780> choice<00:03:01.989> at

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
snacks maybe make a poor choice at

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.809 
snacks maybe make a poor choice at
lunchtime<00:03:02.680> because<00:03:02.890> you're<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.280> hungry

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819

and<00:03:04.090> you're<00:03:04.569> lacking<00:03:05.050> protein<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.739> just

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
and you're lacking protein so you just

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.530 
and you're lacking protein so you just
kind<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.220> want<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.459> hold<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.120> whatever<00:03:07.300> you
