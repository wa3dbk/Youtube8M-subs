this<00:01:30.210> movie<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.110> boom<00:01:31.619> by<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
this movie they can be like boom by the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
this movie they can be like boom by the
way<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.759> connects<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.540> these<00:01:33.689> 7th

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
way this connects into these 7th

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
way this connects into these 7th
generation<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> pretty

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
generation and that could be pretty

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
generation and that could be pretty
crazy<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.259> keep

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
crazy also if you just kind of keep

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
crazy also if you just kind of keep
breaking<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:37.829> 7<00:01:38.369> generation<00:01:38.850> makes<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.210> lot

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
breaking down 7 generation makes a lot

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
breaking down 7 generation makes a lot
of<00:01:39.450> sense<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.869> 2016<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
of sense for 2016 that if there was to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.780 
of sense for 2016 that if there was to
be<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.150> seventh<00:01:42.659> generation<00:01:42.689> game<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.409> 2017<00:01:44.250> we

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
be a seventh generation game in 2017 we

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.630 
be a seventh generation game in 2017 we
would<00:01:44.939> need<00:01:45.060> another<00:01:45.450> movie<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.680> X&amp;Y<00:01:47.250> or

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
would need another movie for X&amp;Y or

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.039 
would need another movie for X&amp;Y or
callous<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.180> sixth<00:01:48.450> generation<00:01:48.600> or<00:01:48.960> whatever

for<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> summer<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> 2017<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.750> could<00:01:51.930> be

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
for the summer of 2017 and that could be

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
for the summer of 2017 and that could be
really<00:01:52.290> clunky<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.680> feel<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> fit

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
really clunky I feel that they can fit

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
really clunky I feel that they can fit
volcanion<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.229> have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
volcanion into this they can have

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.679 
volcanion into this they can have
zygarde<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.070> war<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:57.180> everything

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
zygarde have war and then everything

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.510 
zygarde have war and then everything
else<00:01:57.780> makes<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> sense<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.920> strange

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

would<00:02:09.470> be<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.680> same<00:02:09.890> time<00:02:10.100> from<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.580> to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
black and white to X&amp;Y so the timing's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.980 
black and white to X&amp;Y so the timing's
add<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.430> pretty<00:02:13.460> well<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.360> think<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.660> it's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
add up pretty well and I think that it's

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.840 
add up pretty well and I think that it's
going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.560> very<00:02:15.920> fluid<00:02:16.190> transition<00:02:16.610> if

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
going to be a very fluid transition if

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.580 
going to be a very fluid transition if
they<00:02:16.940> do<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.300> way<00:02:17.480> also<00:02:18.020> since<00:02:18.470> we

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
they do it this way also since we

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.890 
they do it this way also since we
haven't<00:02:18.860> gotten<00:02:19.010> any<00:02:19.280> main<00:02:19.610> series<00:02:20.030> game<00:02:20.630> news

for<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.550> winter<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.570> is<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> very

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
for this winter this is like a very

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.170 
for this winter this is like a very
imaginative<00:02:24.680> thing<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.790> people<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.090> also

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
imaginative thing that people are also

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.240 
imaginative thing that people are also
looking<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.930> I'm<00:02:27.170> still<00:02:27.710> feeling<00:02:27.830> strong

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
looking in like I'm still feeling strong

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.180 
looking in like I'm still feeling strong
that<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.090> very<00:02:29.570> likely<00:02:29.840> zygarde<00:02:30.560> that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
that this is very likely zygarde that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.580 
that this is very likely zygarde that
this<00:02:31.370> monster<00:02:31.610> thing<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.150> feel<00:02:32.480> maybe<00:02:32.990> might<00:02:33.470> be

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
this monster thing I feel maybe might be

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.800 
this monster thing I feel maybe might be
similar<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.420> Celebi<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:35.780> think

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
similar to Celebi now that we think

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.350 
similar to Celebi now that we think
about<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.380> Pokemon<00:02:37.010> forever<00:02:37.280> Celebi<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.150> used

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
about in Pokemon forever Celebi it used

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150 
about in Pokemon forever Celebi it used
its<00:02:38.510> powers<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.230> grow<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.680> forest

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
its powers to like grow the forest

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.400 
its powers to like grow the forest
around<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.730> create<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.450> large<00:02:41.810> Guardian

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
around it and create a large Guardian

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.770 
around it and create a large Guardian
entity<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.280> was<00:02:43.430> fairly<00:02:43.670> monstrous<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.540> as

entity that was fairly monstrous and as
a<00:02:44.810> kid<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.290> thought<00:02:45.320> was<00:02:45.800> fairly<00:02:46.190> demonic<00:02:46.730> cuz

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
a kid I thought was fairly demonic cuz

feel<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.800> this<00:02:51.920> monster<00:02:52.160> thing<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.610> is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
feel that this monster thing that is

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.820 
feel that this monster thing that is
shown<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.390> zygarde<00:02:53.900> movie<00:02:54.230> might<00:02:54.680> have

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
shown in the zygarde movie might have

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.350 
shown in the zygarde movie might have
something<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.310> with<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.580> maybe<00:02:55.730> zygarde

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
something to do with it maybe zygarde

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.660 
something to do with it maybe zygarde
it's<00:02:56.630> special<00:02:57.350> power<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.740> is<00:02:58.040> hinted<00:02:58.340> at<00:02:58.460> in

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
it's special power that is hinted at in

it's special power that is hinted at in
the<00:02:58.790> Pokedex<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.480> might<00:03:00.050> just<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.860> its<00:03:01.010> cave

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
the Pokedex it might just be in its cave

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.860 
the Pokedex it might just be in its cave
and<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.610> realize<00:03:02.060> there's<00:03:02.300> unrest<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.680 
and I realize there's unrest in the
ecosystem<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.280> uses<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> land<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.270> control

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
ecosystem so it uses the land to control

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.330 
ecosystem so it uses the land to control
this<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.380> maybe<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.770> is<00:03:06.950> actually

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
this that maybe this is actually

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.490 
this that maybe this is actually
something<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.790> zygarde<00:03:08.420> creates<00:03:09.140> and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
something that zygarde creates and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.370 
something that zygarde creates and
controls<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.550> fight<00:03:11.060> for<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.660> keep<00:03:11.990> this

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
controls to fight for it to keep this

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.770 
controls to fight for it to keep this
rest<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.250> Kalos<00:03:13.550> region<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.660> could

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
rest in the Kalos region and that could

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.330 
rest in the Kalos region and that could
be<00:03:14.870> something<00:03:15.080> pretty<00:03:15.290> big<00:03:15.560> because<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.220> we

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
be something pretty big because if we

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.410 
be something pretty big because if we
look<00:03:16.520> at<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.910> know<00:03:17.030> there's<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.240> lot<00:03:17.390> of

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
look at it you know there's a lot of

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.940 
look at it you know there's a lot of
similarities<00:03:17.990> I<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.350> talked<00:03:18.590> about<00:03:18.800> before

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
similarities I have talked about before

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.610 
similarities I have talked about before
that<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.790> light<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> head<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.200> zygarde

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
that the light in the head of zygarde

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.130 
that the light in the head of zygarde
really<00:03:21.890> matches<00:03:22.280> up<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.940> geometry<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:23.959> this

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
really matches up the geometry of this

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.510 
really matches up the geometry of this
pokemon<00:03:24.590> where<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.890> light<00:03:25.040> patterns<00:03:25.370> are

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
pokemon where the light patterns are

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.490 
pokemon where the light patterns are
very<00:03:26.090> similar<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.600> one<00:03:26.900> thing<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.140> has<00:03:27.380> been

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
very similar and one thing that has been

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.840 
very similar and one thing that has been
pointed<00:03:27.830> out<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.070> me<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.310> comments<00:03:28.700> is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
pointed out to me in the comments is

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.060 
pointed out to me in the comments is
that<00:03:29.300> Zakhar<00:03:29.630> has<00:03:29.930> like<00:03:30.080> three<00:03:30.380> little<00:03:30.620> arm

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
that Zakhar has like three little arm

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.810 
that Zakhar has like three little arm
nub<00:03:31.640> things<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:32.990> monster<00:03:33.620> or<00:03:34.160> guardian

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
nub things but this monster or guardian

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.970 
nub things but this monster or guardian
whatever<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:35.690> want<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.959> call<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.650> also<00:03:36.830> has

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
whatever you want to call it it also has

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.310 
whatever you want to call it it also has
three<00:03:37.700> arms<00:03:38.120> or<00:03:38.240> at<00:03:38.330> least<00:03:38.480> three<00:03:38.780> appendages

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
three arms or at least three appendages

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.170 
three arms or at least three appendages
in<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.560> way<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:40.190> there's<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:40.670> front

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
in a way that there's like this front

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.330 
in a way that there's like this front
arm<00:03:41.450> part<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.260> back<00:03:42.440> arm<00:03:42.680> part<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.070> then<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
arm part the back arm part and then the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.100 
arm part the back arm part and then the
middle<00:03:43.580> where<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:43.850> hands<00:03:44.150> are<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:44.840> even

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
middle where it's hands are so even

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.060 
middle where it's hands are so even
though<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.290> don't<00:03:45.470> have<00:03:45.530> too<00:03:45.770> much<00:03:45.890> going

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
though we don't have too much going

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.290 
though we don't have too much going
about<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:46.550> we'll<00:03:46.640> find<00:03:46.880> out<00:03:47.030> more<00:03:47.240> about

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
about it and we'll find out more about

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.210 
about it and we'll find out more about
it<00:03:47.690> in<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.260> next<00:03:48.410> coming<00:03:48.770> weeks<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.160> months

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
it in the next coming weeks and months

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.100 
it in the next coming weeks and months
no<00:03:49.850> but<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.060> can<00:03:50.270> look<00:03:50.450> at<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.810> actually

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
no but you can look at this and actually

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.840 
no but you can look at this and actually
kind<00:03:51.320> of<00:03:51.410> draw<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.190> out<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.459> can<00:03:52.610> see<00:03:52.820> that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
kind of draw it out you can see that

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.300 
kind of draw it out you can see that
there's<00:03:53.690> correspondence<00:03:54.410> there<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.830> also

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
there's correspondence there and also

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.190 
there's correspondence there and also
that<00:03:55.490> again<00:03:55.940> geometry<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.600> very<00:03:56.780> similar<00:03:56.990> that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
that again geometry is very similar that

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
that again geometry is very similar that
there's<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.440> spike<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.340> there's<00:03:58.700> these

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
there's a spike to it there's these

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.880 
there's a spike to it there's these
curves<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.810> represents<00:04:00.110> eye<00:04:00.650> guard

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
curves to it that represents eye guard

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.470 
curves to it that represents eye guard
so<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.400> shows<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:01.940> thing<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.300> related

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
so it shows that this thing is related

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.290 
so it shows that this thing is related
to<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.290> eye<00:04:03.440> guard<00:04:03.680> if<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.100> isn't<00:04:04.550> Zygons<00:04:04.940> form

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
to is eye guard if it isn't Zygons form

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.330 
to is eye guard if it isn't Zygons form
or<00:04:05.690> very<00:04:05.959> similar<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.500> zygarde<00:04:06.890> or<00:04:07.040> something

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
or very similar to zygarde or something

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.220 
or very similar to zygarde or something
like<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:08.000> also<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.750> know<00:04:08.930> if<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.080> look

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
like that and also you know if you look

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.680 
like that and also you know if you look
at<00:04:09.320> design<00:04:09.739> could<00:04:10.430> maybe<00:04:10.610> be<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.880> mech<00:04:11.180> maybe

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
at design could maybe be a mech maybe

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.380 
at design could maybe be a mech maybe
it's<00:04:11.989> built<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.670> represent<00:04:13.670> die<00:04:13.940> guard<00:04:14.180> and

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
it's built to represent die guard and

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's built to represent die guard and
use<00:04:14.510> its<00:04:14.690> power<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:15.020> destroy<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.680> by<00:04:15.830> becoming

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
use its power to destroy it by becoming

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.310 
use its power to destroy it by becoming
a<00:04:16.549> creature<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.270> resembles<00:04:17.330> it<00:04:17.960> you<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.169> it

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
a creature that resembles it you know it

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.620 
a creature that resembles it you know it
could<00:04:18.440> be<00:04:18.590> just<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.160> evil<00:04:19.460> guy's<00:04:19.760> creation<00:04:20.479> as

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
could be just the evil guy's creation as

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.060 
could be just the evil guy's creation as
well<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.350> there's<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.530> lot<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.739> really<00:04:21.890> cool

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
well so there's a lot of really cool

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.820 
well so there's a lot of really cool
things<00:04:22.310> going<00:04:22.430> on

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
things going on

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.070 
things going on
is<00:04:22.949> it<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.699> seventh-generation<00:04:24.120> guardian<00:04:24.900> is

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
is it the seventh-generation guardian is

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.080 
is it the seventh-generation guardian is
it<00:04:25.409> zag<00:04:25.650> are<00:04:25.830> there's<00:04:26.039> long<00:04:26.220> there's<00:04:26.819> a<00:04:26.879> lot<00:04:27.000> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
it zag are there's long there's a lot of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.670 
it zag are there's long there's a lot of
resemblances<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.990> what<00:04:28.199> does<00:04:28.349> this<00:04:28.470> mean

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
resemblances and what does this mean

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.740 
resemblances and what does this mean
this<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.490> feel<00:04:29.819> that<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.360> going<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.690> be

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
this is I feel that this is going to be

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.089 
this is I feel that this is going to be
a<00:04:30.780> nice<00:04:31.080> transition<00:04:31.500> in<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.800> seventh

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
a nice transition in the seventh

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.189 
a nice transition in the seventh
generation<00:04:32.129> that<00:04:32.970> way<00:04:33.090> we<00:04:33.240> don't<00:04:33.389> drag<00:04:33.690> on<00:04:33.840> X&amp;Y

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
generation that way we don't drag on X&amp;Y

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.350 
generation that way we don't drag on X&amp;Y
it<00:04:34.319> doesn't<00:04:34.650> make<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.770> too<00:04:34.979> clunky<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.669> even

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
it doesn't make it too clunky and even

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.680 
it doesn't make it too clunky and even
like<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.690> Z<00:04:37.229> version<00:04:37.909> it<00:04:38.909> feels<00:04:39.180> like<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.419> lot<00:04:39.659> of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
like a Z version it feels like a lot of

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.059 
like a Z version it feels like a lot of
things<00:04:39.930> would<00:04:40.050> be<00:04:40.169> unnecessary<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.740> unless

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
things would be unnecessary that unless

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.469 
things would be unnecessary that unless
another<00:04:41.520> thing<00:04:41.759> I<00:04:41.819> saw<00:04:41.970> was<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.210> if<00:04:42.330> they<00:04:42.419> do

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
another thing I saw was that if they do

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.149 
another thing I saw was that if they do
a<00:04:42.569> Z<00:04:42.780> version<00:04:42.960> they<00:04:43.199> might<00:04:43.379> tie<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.830> Johto

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
a Z version they might tie like Johto

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.490 
a Z version they might tie like Johto
region<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.960> which<00:04:45.960> would<00:04:46.139> be<00:04:46.259> interesting

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
region to it which would be interesting

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.249 
region to it which would be interesting
but<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.099> mean<00:04:47.280> like<00:04:47.699> it's<00:04:47.940> just<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.210> lot<00:04:48.419> of<00:04:48.449> fans

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
but I mean like it's just a lot of fans

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.990 
but I mean like it's just a lot of fans
it's<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:49.860> people<00:04:50.009> want<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.550> see<00:04:50.729> at<00:04:50.849> this

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
it's what people want to see at this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.969 
it's what people want to see at this
point<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.599> that's<00:04:52.259> one<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.770> fun<00:04:52.949> things

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
point and that's one of the fun things

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.379 
point and that's one of the fun things
