00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
made a while ago of train craft where I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.730 
made a while ago of train craft where I
built<00:01:20.270> machines<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:20.900> showed<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.410> was<00:01:21.620> all

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.710 
built machines I showed you it was all
to<00:01:21.890> make<00:01:22.010> your<00:01:22.160> railroad<00:01:22.340> automatic<00:01:23.060> except

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
here is actually another speed

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.830 
here is actually another speed
controller<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.940> way<00:02:21.090> once<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> train

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
controller that way once the train

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.180 
controller that way once the train
actually<00:02:22.110> leaves<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.530> it'll<00:02:22.950> start

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
actually leaves here it'll start

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.950 
actually leaves here it'll start
speeding<00:02:23.640> off<00:02:23.790> now<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> site<00:02:24.750> right<00:02:24.930> here

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
speeding off now the site right here

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.230 
speeding off now the site right here
guys<00:02:25.380> right<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:25.860> it's<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.070> pure<00:02:26.460> solid<00:02:26.880> but

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
guys right now it's just pure solid but

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.340 
guys right now it's just pure solid but
when<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> trains<00:02:27.660> actually<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> go

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
when the trains actually about to go

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.290 
when the trains actually about to go
it'll<00:02:28.770> start<00:02:29.010> blinking<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.150> see

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
it'll start blinking as you can see

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.540 
it'll start blinking as you can see
right<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.960> then<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.860> train<00:02:32.100> will<00:02:32.310> go

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
right there and then the train will go

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.910 
right there and then the train will go
off<00:02:32.760> after<00:02:33.030> two<00:02:33.510> blinks<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.200> continue<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.740> its

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
off after two blinks and continue on its

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250 
off after two blinks and continue on its
way<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:35.610> what<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> main<00:02:36.570> concept<00:02:37.140> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
way so that's what the main concept of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050 
way so that's what the main concept of
this<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.710> just<00:02:37.920> another<00:02:38.280> train<00:02:38.700> station

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
this is it's just another train station

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.910 
this is it's just another train station

best with redstone I know I just do the
basic<00:03:15.300> functions<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.380> kind<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.800> but<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> can

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
basic functions of it kind of but I can

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.610 
basic functions of it kind of but I can
get<00:03:17.610> things<00:03:17.850> working<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:19.170> may<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
get things working and it may not be the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.260 
get things working and it may not be the
prettiest<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.970> it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
prettiest but so be it

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.690 
prettiest but so be it
you<00:03:21.420> guys<00:03:21.570> can<00:03:21.780> fix<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:23.670> here

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
you guys can fix it and so right here

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.330 
you guys can fix it and so right here
it'll<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.660> go<00:03:25.020> through<00:03:25.320> it'll<00:03:26.040> go<00:03:26.160> through

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
it'll just go through it'll go through

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.760 
it'll just go through it'll go through
all<00:03:26.640> these<00:03:27.120> repeaters<00:03:27.600> right<00:03:27.750> here<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.200> then

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
all these repeaters right here and then

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.310 
all these repeaters right here and then
right<00:03:29.160> here<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.940> last<00:03:30.210> track<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.230> will

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
right here on this last track it will

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.230 
right here on this last track it will
basically<00:03:31.650> power<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.490> track<00:03:32.790> letting

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
basically power it this track letting

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.180 
basically power it this track letting
the<00:03:33.360> train<00:03:33.630> move<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.470> that's<00:03:34.710> basically

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the train move on so that's basically

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.880 
the train move on so that's basically
everything<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.330> know<00:03:36.750> about<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.410> red<00:03:37.650> line

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
everything you know about the red line

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.320 
everything you know about the red line
right<00:03:38.160> here<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:38.790> let's<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.090> over<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.240> the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
right here now let's go over to the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.510 
right here now let's go over to the
purple<00:03:39.660> line<00:03:39.810> all<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.380> probe<00:03:40.590> line<00:03:40.800> does<00:03:41.250> is

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
purple line all the probe line does is

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.690 
purple line all the probe line does is
it<00:03:42.150> goes<00:03:42.330> from<00:03:42.360> here<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.710> piston<00:03:44.190> or<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
it goes from here to this piston or to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.990 
it goes from here to this piston or to
push<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.480> wool<00:03:45.780> block<00:03:46.110> right<00:03:46.530> here<00:03:47.000> now

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
push this wool block right here now

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.820 
push this wool block right here now
right<00:03:48.240> here<00:03:48.450> guys<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.200> continual

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
right here guys I have a continual

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.380 
right here guys I have a continual
circuit<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.400> think<00:03:50.760> that's<00:03:50.880> what<00:03:51.060> it's<00:03:51.180> called

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
circuit I think that's what it's called

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.850 
circuit I think that's what it's called
I<00:03:51.660> know<00:03:51.810> that's<00:03:51.990> why<00:03:52.080> I've<00:03:52.200> always<00:03:52.350> called<00:03:52.710> it

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
I know that's why I've always called it

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.970 
I know that's why I've always called it
and<00:03:53.010> basically<00:03:53.940> whenever<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:55.200> piston

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and basically whenever that piston

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.540 
and basically whenever that piston
pushes<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.570> block<00:03:57.930> right<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.770> here<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
pushes this block right to here the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.280 
pushes this block right to here the
redstone<00:03:59.910> will<00:04:00.030> go<00:04:00.180> through<00:04:00.450> here<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.840> then

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
redstone will go through here and then

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.100 
redstone will go through here and then
power<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:02.640> redstone<00:04:02.820> torch<00:04:03.480> let's<00:04:03.780> turn<00:04:03.960> you

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
power this redstone torch let's turn you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.070 
power this redstone torch let's turn you
off<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.680> back<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.070> making<00:04:05.910> this<00:04:06.120> blink<00:04:06.510> now<00:04:06.720> I

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
off and back on making this blink now I

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.360 
off and back on making this blink now I
know<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.350> may<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.560> saying<00:04:07.680> why<00:04:08.070> do<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.220> have

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
know you may be saying why do you have

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.070 
know you may be saying why do you have
both<00:04:08.550> these<00:04:08.760> here<00:04:09.090> well<00:04:09.480> cause<00:04:09.630> if<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.810> take

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
both these here well cause if you take

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.260 
both these here well cause if you take
one<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.560> these<00:04:10.680> out<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.520> blinking<00:04:11.940> doesn't

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
one of these out the blinking doesn't

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.760 
one of these out the blinking doesn't
actually<00:04:12.390> last<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.960> long<00:04:13.080> it's<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> very

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
actually last that long it's like a very

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.650 
actually last that long it's like a very
quick<00:04:14.130> blink<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.550> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.760> barely<00:04:14.910> see<00:04:15.240> so<00:04:15.630> I

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
quick blink that you can barely see so I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.599 
quick blink that you can barely see so I
just<00:04:15.870> added<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.590> redstone<00:04:16.980> repeater<00:04:17.400> right

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
just added this redstone repeater right

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.450 
just added this redstone repeater right
here<00:04:17.940> at<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.690> second<00:04:19.109> tick<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.680> way<00:04:19.980> it<00:04:20.340> will

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
here at the second tick that way it will

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.730 
here at the second tick that way it will
power<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:20.940> once<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.630> then<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.200> redstone<00:04:22.590> will

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
power it once and then the redstone will

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.270 
power it once and then the redstone will
power

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
power

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.950 
power
again<00:04:23.550> thus<00:04:23.940> making<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.420> blink<00:04:24.630> last<00:04:24.870> a

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
again thus making the blink last a

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.510 
again thus making the blink last a
little<00:04:25.139> bit<00:04:25.260> longer<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.070> little<00:04:26.340> more

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
little bit longer and a little more

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.610 
little bit longer and a little more
noticeable<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:27.510> that's<00:04:27.720> basically<00:04:28.050> all<00:04:28.290> that

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
noticeable so that's basically all that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.629 
noticeable so that's basically all that
and<00:04:28.920> then<00:04:29.040> right<00:04:29.190> here

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
and then right here

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.180 
and then right here
the<00:04:29.820> orange<00:04:30.150> track<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:31.230> does<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.740> it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
the orange track all this does is it

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.520 
the orange track all this does is it
just<00:04:32.220> goes<00:04:32.639> through<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:33.000> orange<00:04:33.419> line<00:04:33.750> goes

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
just goes through the orange line goes

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.740 
just goes through the orange line goes
right<00:04:34.830> through<00:04:35.160> here<00:04:35.550> keep<00:04:36.300> paying<00:04:36.510> my<00:04:36.600> head

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
right through here keep paying my head

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.310 
right through here keep paying my head
sorry<00:04:36.930> guys<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:38.280> right<00:04:39.000> here<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.870> hits

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
sorry guys and then right here it hits

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.010 
sorry guys and then right here it hits
this<00:04:40.530> piston<00:04:40.950> pushing<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.700> block<00:04:41.940> back<00:04:42.240> that

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
this piston pushing the block back that

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.960 
this piston pushing the block back that
way<00:04:43.230> this<00:04:43.620> won't<00:04:43.860> keep<00:04:44.010> powering<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.669> thus

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
way this won't keep powering it thus

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.580 
way this won't keep powering it thus
blinking<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.840> block<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.200> that's<00:04:46.350> basically

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
blinking the block so that's basically

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.680 
blinking the block so that's basically
all<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:47.040> Redstone<00:04:47.520> behind<00:04:47.730> you<00:04:48.090> guys<00:04:48.240> through

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
all the Redstone behind you guys through

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.290 
all the Redstone behind you guys through
very<00:04:49.230> boring<00:04:49.800> minutes<00:04:50.160> mate<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:50.790> hope

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
very boring minutes mate that I hope

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.730 
very boring minutes mate that I hope
that<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.690> guys<00:04:51.810> like<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.260> series<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.680> know

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
that you guys like the series I know

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.170 
that you guys like the series I know
it's<00:04:52.919> kind<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.160> turn<00:04:53.400> night<00:04:53.639> I<00:04:53.850> honestly
