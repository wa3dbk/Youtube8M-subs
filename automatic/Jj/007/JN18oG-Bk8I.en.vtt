00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:11.610
 Well, of course if you can see the pants 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.620
 clarity does not want to adjust well here 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 processed 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.600
 polished part and here it is 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.600
 raw 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.840
 that is, the floor has become more rich color 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.840
 which was removed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:51.460
 here's the raw I don't know will be on 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.460
 the video will be well, here comes the polishing 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:45.080
 here is the processed part of the street is coal 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.080
 although today what is the second 3 marker 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.530
 places that are not blown away by 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.710
 you so now outside the toys and we will 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.710
 rub 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:19.290
 here are such cracks after small children 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 in order for them not to be in order 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.580
 babes could crawl on the floor safely 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.330
 so that not some nastiness did not fall 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.160
 Now we will process this floor 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.620
 tidied up the toys 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.620
 Well, here from this angle we start to rub 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.709
 very little mastic leaves very little 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:25.800
 so here it is necessary 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.800
 make the whole floor and corridor 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:41.330
 we have already made a balcony; 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:45.569
 from such an angle you can see that the entire laminate 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:50.480
 processed now 15 minutes is necessary in order 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.480
 make it dry 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.180
 into deep gaps that formed 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.020
 of course you have to score right here in 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 such gaps 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.860
 nothing actually comes right 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:15.700
 hammer mastic in but then he is farther 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:19.780
 will not go well so the floor grows up 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.110
 dries well and after 15-20 minutes again 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.070
 it will get stuck and why the video is probably like 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.070
 machine 

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:42.159
 so what are you doing now 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:45.279
 but the light must have dried up which we 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.649
 inflicted and now it can be left 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:49.479
 Polish 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:57.089
 so that it is a thin uniform layer 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:57.089
 distributed throughout the laminate 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.669
 same technology as when 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.669
 bring the machine typewriter 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.669
 dried up 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:18.050
 during the cut their version polishes fox 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.389
 ovanes 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.490
 how the cook waited for the principle one and the others 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.490
 I want to come next 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
 moto
