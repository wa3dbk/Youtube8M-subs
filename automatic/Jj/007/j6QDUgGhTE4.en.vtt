00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you can go for a white white so it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.510 
you can go for a white white so it's
just<00:01:10.200> depending<00:01:10.440> on<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:10.770> preference<00:01:11.280> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we're going for the white white so this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
we're going for the white white so this
would<00:01:15.570> stand<00:01:15.870> out<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> lot<00:01:16.440> more<00:01:16.500> wouldn't<00:01:17.010> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
would stand out a lot more wouldn't it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.850 
would stand out a lot more wouldn't it
whereas<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.340> natural<00:01:17.909> would<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> lot<00:01:18.420> more

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
whereas the natural would be a lot more

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.680 
whereas the natural would be a lot more
subtle<00:01:21.230> exactly<00:01:22.230> so<00:01:22.800> then<00:01:22.980> we<00:01:23.100> put<00:01:23.310> we're

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
subtle exactly so then we put we're

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.270 
subtle exactly so then we put we're
painting<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.780> white<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> base<00:01:25.920> coat

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
painting the white over the base coat

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.149 
painting the white over the base coat
the<00:01:26.490> undercover<00:01:26.850> base<00:01:27.030> coat<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.510> applied

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
the undercover base coat that we applied

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.960 
the undercover base coat that we applied
previously<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> downward<00:01:30.440> motion<00:01:31.970> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
previously also in a downward motion so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.440 
previously also in a downward motion so
you're<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.930> into<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> corners

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
keep the layers really really thin

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.980

you've<00:02:06.299> got<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.540> corrector<00:02:06.930> liquid<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.680> can

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
you've got the corrector liquid you can

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.529 
you've got the corrector liquid you can
then<00:02:08.069> correct<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:08.909> the<00:02:09.000> most<00:02:09.149> perfect

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
then correct it into the most perfect

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.559 
then correct it into the most perfect
arch

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:24.000 

exactly<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:14.319> what<00:02:14.469> I'm<00:02:14.999> going<00:02:15.999> to<00:02:16.030> do

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.339

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
so you can't use this with remover

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.530
