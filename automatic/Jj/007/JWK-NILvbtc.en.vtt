00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.030 
tenth fret and this chord that I'm
playing<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:14.870> my<00:02:15.870> second<00:02:16.350> fingers<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
playing is my second fingers at the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.390 
playing is my second fingers at the
tenth<00:02:17.310> fret<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.510> low<00:02:18.660> E<00:02:18.840> string<00:02:19.130> my<00:02:20.130> ring

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
tenth fret of the low E string my ring

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.760 
tenth fret of the low E string my ring
finger<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.210> at<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> tenth<00:02:21.780> fret<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.410> g

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.430 
finger is at the tenth fret of the g
string<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:24.420> guess<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:24.930> kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.320> an

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
string and I guess it's kind of like an

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.790 
string and I guess it's kind of like an
octave<00:02:25.860> chord<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.690> could<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.810> moved<00:02:28.050> around

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
octave chord and could be moved around

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.610 
octave chord and could be moved around
you<00:02:29.040> know<00:02:29.420> movable<00:02:30.420> shape<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.500> is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you know movable shape this this is

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.350 
you know movable shape this this is
going<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.830> go<00:02:31.980> from<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> tenth<00:02:33.090> fret<00:02:38.360> back

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
going to go from the tenth fret back

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.100 
going to go from the tenth fret back
open

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.650 

and<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:44.830> play<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.250> chord<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.819> little<00:02:45.910> bit

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and you can play that chord a little bit

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.559 
and you can play that chord a little bit
differently<00:02:47.670> they<00:02:48.670> either<00:02:48.849> play<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.239> with<00:02:49.540> the

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:35.790 

and<00:03:18.549> then<00:03:18.730> when<00:03:19.299> he<00:03:19.390> goes<00:03:19.599> into

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:46.199 

so<00:03:36.800> again<00:03:37.130> that's<00:03:37.310> 7th

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.010 

open

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
open

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.410 
open
and<00:03:49.370> you're<00:03:50.370> playing<00:03:50.550> this<00:03:50.790> little<00:03:51.030> this

little lick here either play I'm just on

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.949 
little lick here either play I'm just on
the<00:03:56.070> high<00:03:56.280> E<00:03:56.310> string

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.429 

or<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.920> could<00:04:00.159> you<00:04:01.090> could<00:04:01.299> play<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.569> that<00:04:02.109> D

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
or you could you could play that that D

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.670 
or you could you could play that that D
chord<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:03.329> add<00:04:04.329> your<00:04:04.689> ring<00:04:05.260> finger

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
chord and add your ring finger

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.510

underneath

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.690 

as<00:04:12.180> long<00:04:12.390> as<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.990> know<00:04:13.370> once<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.520> do<00:04:14.670> that

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
as long as you you know once you do that

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:28.890 
as long as you you know once you do that
little<00:04:15.980> pull-off<00:04:17.450> play<00:04:18.450> open

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.260 

I<00:04:28.990> think<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.070> think<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.580> sounds<00:04:30.699> better<00:04:30.940> just

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
I think it I think it sounds better just

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:41.760 
I think it I think it sounds better just
playing<00:04:31.509> it<00:04:31.660> on<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.900> high<00:04:32.080> high<00:04:33.070> e-string

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.339 

and<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:46.240> I've<00:04:46.569> gone<00:04:46.750> over<00:04:47.080> everything

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
and so I think I've gone over everything

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.260 
and so I think I've gone over everything
in<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:48.069> and<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:51.220> main<00:04:51.430> thing<00:04:51.669> is<00:04:51.879> you<00:04:52.180> know

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
in this and the main thing is you know

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.059 
in this and the main thing is you know
getting<00:04:52.690> getting<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:53.110> strumming<00:04:53.530> pattern<00:04:53.949> I

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
getting getting a strumming pattern I

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.279 
getting getting a strumming pattern I
guess<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.750> getting<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:55.810> know<00:04:55.840> just<00:04:56.110> getting

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
guess and getting you know just getting

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:03.719 
guess and getting you know just getting
it<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.740> tuning<00:04:57.220> for<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.729> matter<00:05:02.729> the

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
it in this tuning for that matter the

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.029 
it in this tuning for that matter the
strumming<00:05:04.389> pattern<00:05:04.419> just<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.199> up<00:05:05.379> down<00:05:05.650> up

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
strumming pattern just that up down up

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.680 
strumming pattern just that up down up
down<00:05:06.639> down<00:05:06.940> up<00:05:07.300> down<00:05:07.360> up<00:05:07.569> down<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:09.539> you<00:05:10.539> know

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
down down up down up down and you know

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.930 
down down up down up down and you know
with<00:05:10.990> it's<00:05:11.470> basically<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.520> strumming

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
with it's basically the strumming

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.309 
with it's basically the strumming
pattern<00:05:12.970> is<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.539> same<00:05:13.569> when<00:05:13.990> you're<00:05:14.080> doing

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
pattern is the same when you're doing

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:25.860 
pattern is the same when you're doing
this<00:05:15.509> as

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.659 

look<00:05:26.440> your<00:05:26.620> right<00:05:26.800> hand<00:05:27.130> is<00:05:27.280> going<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.520> be

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
look your right hand is going to be

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.080 
look your right hand is going to be
going<00:05:28.419> to<00:05:28.510> be<00:05:29.160> doing<00:05:30.160> that<00:05:30.370> same<00:05:30.610> rather<00:05:30.940> than

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
going to be doing that same rather than

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:47.550 
going to be doing that same rather than
the<00:05:31.180> same<00:05:31.419> strumming<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:45.419> okay<00:05:46.419> so<00:05:46.449> I<00:05:46.960> hope

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
the same strumming so okay so I hope

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.250 
the same strumming so okay so I hope
that<00:05:47.620> this<00:05:47.889> helps<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.370> out<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:52.080> good<00:05:53.080> luck
