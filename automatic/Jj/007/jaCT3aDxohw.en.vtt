00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
is a good deck i use other people say

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.629 
is a good deck i use other people say
like<00:05:28.430> this

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
like this

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.059 
like this
good<00:05:29.999> of<00:05:30.090> a<00:05:30.150> deck<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:30.569> once<00:05:31.319> I<00:05:31.499> do<00:05:31.560> limit<00:05:31.979> on

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
good of a deck but once I do limit on

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.360 
good of a deck but once I do limit on
that<00:05:32.219> I<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:33.360> kind<00:05:33.659> of<00:05:33.689> comes<00:05:34.050> even<00:05:34.319> so<00:05:35.039> in<00:05:35.249> a

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
that I it kind of comes even so in a

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.959 
that I it kind of comes even so in a
ratio<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.819> one<00:05:36.479> loss<00:05:36.689> this<00:05:37.020> is<00:05:37.710> like<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:38.039> five<00:05:38.759> to

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
ratio of one loss this is like a five to

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:44.059 
ratio of one loss this is like a five to
two<00:05:39.180> so<00:05:39.659> you<00:05:40.529> 13<00:05:41.129> and<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.550> lose<00:05:41.759> two<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.659> it<00:05:43.139> is

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
two so you 13 and you lose two so it is

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.959 
two so you 13 and you lose two so it is
kind<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.569> mediocre<00:05:45.569> deck<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.759> still<00:05:47.759> I

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
kind of a mediocre deck and still I

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.689 
kind of a mediocre deck and still I
