so<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.340> definitely<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.570> rebirth

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
so we have definitely a rebirth

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.660 
so we have definitely a rebirth
beginning<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.250> played<00:00:17.400> against

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
beginning like that we played against

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.689 
beginning like that we played against
strong<00:00:17.940> teams<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.330> ska<00:00:19.080> fanatic<00:00:19.619> rocket<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
strong teams like ska fanatic rocket and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.509 
strong teams like ska fanatic rocket and
ul<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> was<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> toughest<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
ul so it was like one of the toughest to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
ul so it was like one of the toughest to
face<00:00:23.810> but<00:00:24.810> no<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.260> face<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.769> easier<00:00:26.130> team

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
face but no we face like easier team

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.800

like<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> Giants<00:00:27.449> next<00:00:27.630> week<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
like you will have a Giants next week I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290 
like you will have a Giants next week I
think<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.890> think<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.490> make<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.060> lot<00:00:30.240> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
think so we think we can make a lot of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.060 
think so we think we can make a lot of
wins<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.689> next<00:00:30.929> weeks<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:31.980> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
wins in the next weeks so you think it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
wins in the next weeks so you think it's
definitely<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.460> team-based<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> amazing

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
definitely a team-based think is amazing

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that gambit did better here than in

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.049

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
actually translating the early game

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
actually translating the early game
control<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> early<00:00:43.410> game<00:00:43.530> gains<00:00:43.770> into

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
control in the early game gains into

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.940 
control in the early game gains into
some<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> mid<00:00:45.149> game<00:00:45.390> strategy<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.469> they

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
some kind of mid game strategy but they

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
some kind of mid game strategy but they
actually<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> hold<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.000> some<00:00:48.239> point<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
