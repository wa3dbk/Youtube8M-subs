okay<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> look<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.640> bucket<00:00:33.570> wrap

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
okay here is a look at the bucket wrap

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.340 
okay here is a look at the bucket wrap
is<00:00:34.530> basically<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.280> tool<00:00:35.730> belt<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.960> bucket

and so it has all different kinds of
solutions<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.469> storage<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.000> will<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
solutions for storage now I will have a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.190 
solutions for storage now I will have a
link<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> video<00:00:43.500> description<00:00:43.530> below<00:00:44.520> for

multiple different styles of these

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
multiple different styles of these
bucket<00:00:48.090> wraps<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.469> have

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
bucket wraps some that actually have

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.819 
bucket wraps some that actually have
enclosed<00:00:50.370> zipper<00:00:51.360> pockets

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
enclosed zipper pockets

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.279 
enclosed zipper pockets
but<00:00:54.789> what<00:00:55.390> we're<00:00:55.539> going<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.719> need<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:55.989> do<00:00:56.109> is

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
but what we're going to need to do is

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.509 
but what we're going to need to do is
we're<00:00:56.469> gonna<00:00:56.530> need<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:56.859> take<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.249> bucket

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
we're gonna need to take this bucket

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.729 
we're gonna need to take this bucket
wrap<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.030> as<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.239> can<00:00:58.390> see<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.929> fits<00:00:59.500> inside

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
wrap and as you can see it fits inside

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.649 
wrap and as you can see it fits inside
the<00:01:00.159> bucket<00:01:00.309> down<00:01:00.699> here<00:01:01.000> we're<00:01:01.570> gonna

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
the bucket down here we're gonna

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.139 
the bucket down here we're gonna
actually<00:01:01.899> need<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.289> trim<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.129> we're<00:01:04.059> gonna

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
actually need a trim it so we're gonna

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.560 
actually need a trim it so we're gonna

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
make it so that we probably only have

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.679 
make it so that we probably only have
about<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.840> inch<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.830> two<00:01:09.040> inches<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:10.119> overhang

about a inch to two inches of overhang

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.450 
about a inch to two inches of overhang
here<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:11.170> then<00:01:11.680> we're<00:01:11.799> going<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.130> actually

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
threads okay we now have the drain put

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.710 
threads okay we now have the drain put
in<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.880> can<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.790> now<00:03:40.000> we<00:03:40.060> are<00:03:40.420> going

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
in that you can see and now we are going

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.210 
in that you can see and now we are going
to<00:03:41.460> attach<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:43.030> set<00:03:43.330> up<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.840> pump<00:03:44.050> system<00:03:44.350> cat

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
to attach and set up the pump system cat

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.750 
to attach and set up the pump system cat
attaching<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.540> aerator<00:03:47.020> head<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.550> that's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
attaching the aerator head so that's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.700 
attaching the aerator head so that's
going<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.030> be<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> similar<00:03:49.510> procedure<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.530> what

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
going to be a similar procedure to what

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.190 
going to be a similar procedure to what
we<00:03:50.830> did<00:03:50.980> here<00:03:51.340> with<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.550> drain<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:53.080> we're

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
we did here with the drain so we're

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.320 
we did here with the drain so we're
gonna<00:03:53.290> drill<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.740> same<00:03:53.980> size<00:03:54.250> hole<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:55.210> we're

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
gonna drill the same size hole but we're

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.280 
gonna drill the same size hole but we're
gonna<00:03:55.420> do<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.810> on<00:03:55.960> this<00:03:56.170> side<00:03:57.780> okay<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:58.810> now<00:03:59.230> the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
gonna do it on this side okay so now the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.120 
gonna do it on this side okay so now the
spray<00:03:59.890> head<00:04:00.160> is<00:04:01.320> installed<00:04:02.320> so<00:04:02.680> we'll<00:04:02.800> be<00:04:02.950> able

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
spray head is installed so we'll be able

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.090 
spray head is installed so we'll be able
to<00:04:03.250> change<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:04.180> rate<00:04:04.510> or<00:04:05.460> flow<00:04:06.460> of<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.150> pump

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
to change the rate or flow of the pump

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.060 
to change the rate or flow of the pump
is<00:04:09.100> then<00:04:09.340> gonna<00:04:09.550> be<00:04:09.790> attached<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.600> side

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
is then gonna be attached to this side

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.090 
is then gonna be attached to this side
we<00:04:12.070> now<00:04:12.250> need<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.760> have<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.180> pump<00:04:13.540> set<00:04:13.810> up<00:04:14.100> now

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
we now need to have the pump set up now

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.610 
we now need to have the pump set up now
just<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.730> make<00:04:15.880> sure<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.660> pump<00:04:17.230> stays

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
just to make sure that the pump stays

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.950 
just to make sure that the pump stays
attached<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.270> tubing<00:04:19.660> stays

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
attached and that the tubing stays

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.100 
attached and that the tubing stays
attached<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:21.000> would<00:04:22.000> recommend<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.960> you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
attached I would recommend that you

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.620 
attached I would recommend that you
actually<00:04:23.260> use<00:04:23.640> these<00:04:25.200> types<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.500> fittings<00:04:27.630> or

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
actually use these types of fittings or

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.710 
actually use these types of fittings or
the<00:04:28.680> clamps<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:30.130> your<00:04:30.250> fittings<00:04:30.610> instead<00:04:31.570> of

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
the clamps for your fittings instead of

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.490 
the clamps for your fittings instead of
the<00:04:31.810> plastic<00:04:32.050> ones<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.860> come<00:04:33.100> with<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> pump

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
the plastic ones that come with the pump

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.990 
the plastic ones that come with the pump
for<00:04:35.500> now<00:04:35.680> I'm<00:04:35.950> just<00:04:35.980> going<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.400> end<00:04:36.580> up<00:04:36.760> using

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
for now I'm just going to end up using

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.360 
for now I'm just going to end up using
both<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.840> plastic<00:04:38.290> ones<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.710> come<00:04:38.920> with<00:04:39.190> the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
both the plastic ones that come with the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.120 
both the plastic ones that come with the
pump<00:04:39.610> right<00:04:39.910> here<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:41.170> I'm<00:04:41.290> gonna<00:04:41.410> use<00:04:41.770> this

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
pump right here and I'm gonna use this

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.660 
pump right here and I'm gonna use this
up<00:04:42.820> here<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.860> attach<00:04:45.190> them<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.330> tube<00:04:47.670> so

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
up here to attach them to the tube so

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.300 
up here to attach them to the tube so
here<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.600> look<00:04:49.840> at<00:04:49.990> what<00:04:50.050> we<00:04:50.290> have<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.680> far<00:04:50.950> we

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
here is a look at what we have so far we

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.540 
here is a look at what we have so far we
have<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.210> spray<00:04:52.570> head<00:04:52.980> which<00:04:53.980> will<00:04:54.220> allow<00:04:54.400> us

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
have the spray head which will allow us

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.740 
have the spray head which will allow us
to<00:04:54.610> change<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.210> flow<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.960> pump<00:04:57.510> we<00:04:58.510> have

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
to change the flow of the pump we have

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.100 
to change the flow of the pump we have
the<00:04:59.440> drain<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.180> tubing<00:05:01.510> coming<00:05:01.840> off<00:05:01.960> the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
the drain and the tubing coming off the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.950 
the drain and the tubing coming off the
side<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.710> then<00:05:03.580> from<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.030> spray<00:05:04.480> head<00:05:04.720> you

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
side and then from the spray head you

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.410 
side and then from the spray head you
have<00:05:05.370> tubing<00:05:06.400> coming<00:05:06.970> off<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.240> side

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
have tubing coming off the side

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.950 
have tubing coming off the side
to<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.470> pump<00:05:10.120> benefits<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.300> having<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:11.690> pump

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
to the pump benefits of having the pump

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.140 
to the pump benefits of having the pump
dangled<00:05:12.410> over<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.770> edges<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.460> will<00:05:13.700> not<00:05:13.910> have

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
dangled over the edges it will not have

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.880 
dangled over the edges it will not have
to<00:05:14.330> prime<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.960> will<00:05:15.140> not<00:05:15.290> have<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.620> have<00:05:15.710> it

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
to prime you will not have to have it

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.300 
to prime you will not have to have it
one<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.130> those<00:05:16.360> squeezing<00:05:17.710> primers<00:05:18.710> in<00:05:19.130> the

one of those squeezing primers in the
tube<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.910> order<00:05:20.420> to<00:05:20.600> suck<00:05:20.870> up<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.230> water<00:05:21.260> this

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
tube in order to suck up the water this

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.520 
tube in order to suck up the water this
will<00:05:22.550> just<00:05:22.760> prime<00:05:23.390> itself<00:05:23.840> because<00:05:24.200> it's<00:05:24.380> in

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
will just prime itself because it's in

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.070 
will just prime itself because it's in
the<00:05:24.590> water<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:26.090> important<00:05:26.690> thing<00:05:26.840> though<00:05:27.050> is

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
the water the important thing though is

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.010 
the water the important thing though is
that<00:05:27.230> you<00:05:27.650> end<00:05:27.920> up<00:05:28.250> getting<00:05:28.700> steel<00:05:29.270> clamps<00:05:29.660> I

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
that you end up getting steel clamps I

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.710 
that you end up getting steel clamps I
would<00:05:30.290> recommend<00:05:30.710> steel<00:05:30.980> clamps<00:05:31.360> for<00:05:32.360> holding

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
would recommend steel clamps for holding

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.160 
would recommend steel clamps for holding
the<00:05:32.840> tube<00:05:33.050> onto<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.950> fitting<00:05:34.690> some<00:05:35.690> similar

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
the tube onto the fitting some similar

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.670 
the tube onto the fitting some similar
to<00:05:36.230> this<00:05:36.470> we<00:05:36.800> just<00:05:36.830> ran<00:05:37.220> out<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.900> for<00:05:38.900> purposes

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
to this we just ran out so for purposes

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.370 
to this we just ran out so for purposes
of<00:05:40.190> just<00:05:40.310> showing<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:40.820> video<00:05:41.260> we<00:05:42.260> are

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
of just showing this video we are

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.070 
of just showing this video we are
showing<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.980> without<00:05:43.340> but<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:44.210> would<00:05:44.930> recommend

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
showing it without but I would recommend

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.400 
showing it without but I would recommend
these<00:05:45.560> steel<00:05:45.980> clamps<00:05:46.280> for<00:05:47.150> all<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:48.020> fittings

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
these steel clamps for all the fittings

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.090 
these steel clamps for all the fittings
and<00:05:49.060> places<00:05:50.060> where<00:05:50.180> you're<00:05:50.330> connecting<00:05:50.780> tubes

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
and places where you're connecting tubes

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.270 
and places where you're connecting tubes
including<00:05:52.100> this<00:05:52.790> as<00:05:53.660> you<00:05:53.900> can<00:05:53.930> see<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:54.980> what

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
including this as you can see and what

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.280 
including this as you can see and what
you<00:05:55.400> probably<00:05:55.550> notice<00:05:56.060> I<00:05:56.210> didn't<00:05:56.600> finish<00:05:56.900> off

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
you probably notice I didn't finish off

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.160 
you probably notice I didn't finish off
the<00:05:58.250> pump<00:05:58.550> set<00:05:58.760> up<00:05:58.970> with<00:05:59.270> any<00:05:59.540> specific

connectors<00:06:00.680> yet<00:06:00.920> that's<00:06:01.580> because<00:06:01.940> everyone

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
connectors yet that's because everyone

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.110 
connectors yet that's because everyone
seems<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:02.870> have<00:06:02.990> their<00:06:03.140> own<00:06:03.590> idea<00:06:04.490> of<00:06:04.580> how<00:06:04.790> they

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
seems to have their own idea of how they

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.810 
seems to have their own idea of how they
like<00:06:05.540> to<00:06:05.750> have<00:06:05.930> their<00:06:06.200> power<00:06:06.800> to<00:06:07.310> their<00:06:07.430> kayak

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
like to have their power to their kayak

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.560 
like to have their power to their kayak
and<00:06:08.120> they<00:06:08.690> all<00:06:08.780> have<00:06:08.960> different<00:06:09.320> connections

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
and they all have different connections

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.230 
and they all have different connections
now<00:06:11.570> we're<00:06:12.110> gonna<00:06:12.200> go<00:06:12.500> and<00:06:12.850> take<00:06:13.850> a<00:06:13.880> look<00:06:14.120> at

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.230 
now we're gonna go and take a look at
what<00:06:14.540> lid<00:06:14.870> options<00:06:15.320> we<00:06:15.500> have<00:06:15.760> okay<00:06:16.760> this<00:06:17.030> is

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
what lid options we have okay this is

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.260 
what lid options we have okay this is
option<00:06:17.630> number<00:06:17.750> one<00:06:18.080> this<00:06:18.860> here<00:06:19.220> is<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:20.600> husky

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
option number one this here is the husky

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.960 
option number one this here is the husky
storage<00:06:23.270> organizer<00:06:24.130> it<00:06:25.130> just<00:06:25.520> fits<00:06:25.850> right

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
storage organizer it just fits right

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.990 
storage organizer it just fits right
over<00:06:26.360> top<00:06:26.540> here<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:27.160> it<00:06:28.160> will<00:06:28.340> lock<00:06:28.700> into

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
over top here and it will lock into

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.070 
over top here and it will lock into
place<00:06:29.120> it's<00:06:29.450> actually<00:06:29.840> meant<00:06:30.080> for<00:06:30.580> this<00:06:32.080> whole

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
place it's actually meant for this whole

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:43.060 
place it's actually meant for this whole
setup<00:06:33.440> as<00:06:33.770> you<00:06:34.220> can<00:06:34.370> see<00:06:34.550> there<00:06:41.050> so<00:06:42.050> this<00:06:42.830> one's

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
setup as you can see there so this one's

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:50.710 
setup as you can see there so this one's
kind<00:06:43.340> of<00:06:43.460> nice<00:06:43.640> because<00:06:43.940> it<00:06:44.360> has<00:06:44.560> storage<00:06:49.720> so

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
kind of nice because it has storage so

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.020 
kind of nice because it has storage so
you<00:06:50.750> can<00:06:51.080> have<00:06:51.320> all<00:06:51.590> of<00:06:51.950> your<00:06:52.250> favorite<00:06:52.430> tackle

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
you can have all of your favorite tackle

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.760 
you can have all of your favorite tackle
off<00:06:53.120> top<00:06:55.660> but<00:06:56.710> one<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:57.740> the<00:06:57.860> problems<00:06:58.100> with<00:06:58.550> it

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
off top but one of the problems with it

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.180 
off top but one of the problems with it
doesn't<00:07:00.770> necessarily<00:07:01.730> stay<00:07:02.030> on<00:07:02.330> like<00:07:03.290> it's

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
doesn't necessarily stay on like it's

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.860 
doesn't necessarily stay on like it's
not<00:07:04.580> but<00:07:05.090> it<00:07:05.210> can<00:07:05.330> easily<00:07:05.540> come<00:07:05.960> off<00:07:05.990> too<00:07:07.870> so

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
not but it can easily come off too so

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.200 
not but it can easily come off too so
this<00:07:09.320> could<00:07:09.560> land<00:07:09.800> in<00:07:09.980> the<00:07:10.070> water<00:07:10.250> you<00:07:11.060> may

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
this could land in the water you may

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.230 
this could land in the water you may
want<00:07:11.510> it<00:07:11.570> to<00:07:11.720> drill<00:07:12.080> a<00:07:12.110> hole<00:07:12.230> and<00:07:13.000> take<00:07:14.000> some

it<00:07:18.410> to<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:18.950> actual<00:07:19.370> bag

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
it to the actual bag

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.820 
it to the actual bag
there<00:07:21.300> is<00:07:21.420> actually<00:07:21.870> a<00:07:21.900> good<00:07:22.050> attached<00:07:22.380> point

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830
