version of this is in my book considered

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.959 
version of this is in my book considered
the<00:00:31.170> next<00:00:31.439> iteration<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.279> when<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> do

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the next iteration of it when I do

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.260 
the next iteration of it when I do
personal<00:00:33.750> artwork<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.469> uh<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.250> kind<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
personal artwork it's uh it's kind of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330 
personal artwork it's uh it's kind of
tricky<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.040> done

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
tricky because when I'm when I'm done

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
tricky because when I'm when I'm done
with<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.730> artwork<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.300> usually<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:39.870> back<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
with the artwork I usually go back and I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020 
with the artwork I usually go back and I
see<00:00:40.559> ways<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.010> I'd<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> refine<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.879> or

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
see ways that I'd like to refine it or

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.380 
see ways that I'd like to refine it or
redo<00:00:42.809> parts<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.910> same<00:00:44.910> thing<00:00:44.940> happens

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
redo parts of it and same thing happens

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.029 
redo parts of it and same thing happens
every<00:00:45.660> time<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.170> sure<00:00:46.350> enough<00:00:46.379> about<00:00:46.800> an<00:00:46.920> hour

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
every time and sure enough about an hour

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.490 
every time and sure enough about an hour
after<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> was<00:00:47.610> done<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.320> look<00:00:49.320> back

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
after I was done with this I look back

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
after I was done with this I look back
at<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.010> thought<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.850> there's<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
at it and thought you know there's a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.430 
at it and thought you know there's a
whole<00:00:51.390> nother<00:00:51.510> direction<00:00:51.960> I'd<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.320> take

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
whole nother direction I'd like to take

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.939 
whole nother direction I'd like to take
this<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> happens<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
this and it happens a lot and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.520 
this and it happens a lot and
fortunately<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.760> just

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
fortunately you can do that with just

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
fortunately you can do that with just
projects<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.010> fun<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.629> when<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
projects like this for fun and when you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
projects like this for fun and when you
have<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.250> again<00:01:02.460> it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
have the time to do it but again it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
have the time to do it but again it
probably<00:01:03.510> takes<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> while<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> i'll<00:01:04.290> probably

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
probably takes a while and i'll probably

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
probably takes a while and i'll probably
get<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> next<00:01:05.189> revision<00:01:05.489> about<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> year

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
get to the next revision about a year

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
get to the next revision about a year
and<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> half<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:08.100> finish

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and a half from now and actually finish

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.740 
and a half from now and actually finish
it<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:10.700> but<00:01:11.700> i'm<00:01:11.790> using<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> same<00:01:12.299> techniques

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it up but i'm using the same techniques

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.149 
it up but i'm using the same techniques
as<00:01:12.869> you've<00:01:13.049> seen<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> prestige<00:01:13.799> videos

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
as you've seen in the prestige videos

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
as you've seen in the prestige videos
this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.580> simply<00:01:15.619> creating<00:01:16.619> paths<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this is simply creating paths with the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.090 
this is simply creating paths with the
pin<00:01:17.310> filling<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.030> color<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.100> creating

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pin filling it with color and creating

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.249 
pin filling it with color and creating
shadows<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> highlights<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> dodge

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
shadows and highlights with the dodge

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.179 
shadows and highlights with the dodge
and<00:01:22.470> burn<00:01:22.500> tools<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.810> it's<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:26.040> an

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and burn tools and it's it's it's an

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
and burn tools and it's it's it's an
interesting<00:01:26.400> style<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.150> i<00:01:29.540> think<00:01:30.540> i've

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
interesting style to do i think i've

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
interesting style to do i think i've
done<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> enough<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.500> though<00:01:31.740> i<00:01:32.000> probably

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
done it enough now though i probably

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.929 
done it enough now though i probably
need<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> move<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> something<00:01:34.110> else<00:01:34.939> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
need to move on to something else and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.539 
need to move on to something else and
find<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:36.960> technique<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.890> I'll<00:01:38.369> definitely

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
find a new technique but I'll definitely

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
find a new technique but I'll definitely
keep<00:01:38.909> using<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> finish<00:01:39.810> off<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> prestige

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
keep using it to finish off the prestige

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.190 
keep using it to finish off the prestige
emblem<00:01:41.340> series<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:43.009> probably<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> next

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
emblem series and probably on the next

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
emblem series and probably on the next
artwork<00:01:46.200> project<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.040> random<00:01:47.430> art<00:01:47.610> I'll<00:01:47.880> try

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
artwork project the random art I'll try

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
artwork project the random art I'll try
a<00:01:48.329> different<00:01:48.780> technique<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:49.950> what

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
a different technique and just see what

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.630 
a different technique and just see what
we<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.579> into<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.070> any<00:01:53.220> parts

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
we can get into and if you see any parts

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
we can get into and if you see any parts
of<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.939> where<00:01:54.240> you'd<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> tutorial<00:01:55.200> of

want to take it and whether or not I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.430 
want to take it and whether or not I
