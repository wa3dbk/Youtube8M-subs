00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.659 

oh<00:00:00.030> my<00:00:00.299> god<00:00:00.480> dancing<00:00:01.050> that<00:00:01.140> Whitney<00:00:01.469> was

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:01.669 
oh my god dancing that Whitney was

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.200 
oh my god dancing that Whitney was
amazing

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
amazing

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.590 
amazing
we<00:00:03.510> had<00:00:03.659> so<00:00:03.870> much<00:00:03.990> fun<00:00:04.049> during<00:00:04.410> practices<00:00:05.069> and

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
we had so much fun during practices and

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.220 
we had so much fun during practices and
what<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.750> hard<00:00:07.020> was<00:00:08.420> ballroom<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.599> itself

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
what was hard was ballroom in itself

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.580 
what was hard was ballroom in itself
it<00:00:11.070> requires<00:00:11.490> whenever<00:00:12.300> couples<00:00:13.170> compete<00:00:13.469> in

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it requires whenever couples compete in

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
it requires whenever couples compete in
ballroom<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.190> requires<00:00:14.700> them<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.299> so

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
ballroom it requires them to have so

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.390 
ballroom it requires them to have so
many<00:00:15.660> years<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.199> experience<00:00:16.289> together<00:00:17.130> in

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
many years of experience together in

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.670 
many years of experience together in
order<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.359> chemistry<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.529> had

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
order to get that chemistry and we had

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.630 
order to get that chemistry and we had
to<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:21.050> eight<00:00:22.050> hours<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> it's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to do it in like eight hours so it's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.429 
to do it in like eight hours so it's
just<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.660> really<00:00:24.900> tough

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
just it was really it was really tough

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.920 
just it was really it was really tough
at<00:00:25.830> first<00:00:25.939> finding<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.029> chemistry<00:00:27.599> together

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
at first finding that chemistry together

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
at first finding that chemistry together
because<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.590> takes<00:00:28.830> people<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.369> long<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.119> get

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
because it takes people so long to get

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.959 
because it takes people so long to get
it<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.109> feel<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.340> don't<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.759> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it but I feel like we I don't know we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
it but I feel like we I don't know we
took<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.480> injection<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> something<00:00:34.469> I

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
took like this injection of something I

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.850 
took like this injection of something I
don't<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:34.950> chemistry<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.390> like

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
don't know chemistry and we just like

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.090 
don't know chemistry and we just like
were<00:00:37.860> able<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> connect<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.850> together<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
were able to connect so all together so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.290 
were able to connect so all together so
it<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.430> fun<00:00:41.520> working<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.090> her<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it was really fun working with her and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
it was really fun working with her and
she<00:00:42.420> brought<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.290> extra<00:00:43.680> energy<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
she brought like this extra energy to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.910 
she brought like this extra energy to
the<00:00:44.340> table<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> feed<00:00:45.329> off<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
the table that I got to feed off of and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
the table that I got to feed off of and
I<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.430> enjoyed<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> dancing<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.510> her

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I really enjoyed the dancing with her

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.160 
I really enjoyed the dancing with her

it was it was a hot night I was trying
to<00:00:54.840> make<00:00:55.020> chemistry<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> did

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to make chemistry and I think it did

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.619 
to make chemistry and I think it did
work<00:00:58.460> yes<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.390> guy<00:01:00.600> like

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
be surprised the desert starts to pick

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.649 
be surprised the desert starts to pick
them<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.310> know

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
them up you know

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.469 
them up you know
this<00:01:29.749> is<00:01:29.929> just<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:30.409> good<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:32.210> can<00:01:32.359> do

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
this is just so good and you can do

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.929 
this is just so good and you can do
everything<00:01:32.630> which<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.649> think<00:01:33.859> forget<00:01:34.700> like

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
everything which is I think forget like

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.239 
everything which is I think forget like
he<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.420> Latin<00:01:35.719> dancer<00:01:36.229> because<00:01:36.469> he's<00:01:36.770> so

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
he is a Latin dancer because he's so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.490 
he is a Latin dancer because he's so
good<00:01:37.280> everything<00:01:37.850> else<00:01:38.049> but<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.109> had<00:01:39.289> such<00:01:39.469> a

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
good everything else but I had such a

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800 
good everything else but I had such a
great<00:01:39.649> time<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.039> think<00:01:40.369> we've<00:01:40.640> all<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:41.659> both

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
great time I think we've all we both

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.340 
great time I think we've all we both
learned<00:01:42.140> from<00:01:42.380> each<00:01:42.500> other<00:01:42.709> on<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:44.350> when

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
learned from each other on this one when

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.529 
learned from each other on this one when
I<00:01:45.380> go<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.130> haven't<00:01:46.609> done<00:01:46.789> some<00:01:47.090> Arizona

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
I go okay so I haven't done some Arizona

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.440 
I go okay so I haven't done some Arizona
or<00:01:47.719> this<00:01:47.869> whole<00:01:48.140> season<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.039> far<00:01:49.099> and<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:50.270> was

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
or this whole season so far and it was

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.609 
or this whole season so far and it was
just<00:01:50.659> so<00:01:51.909> stressful<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.390> relieving<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.469> to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
just so stressful and relieving you to

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.559 
just so stressful and relieving you to
get<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.459> get<00:01:55.579> cha-cha<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.359> first

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
get that to get cha-cha for the first

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.980 
get that to get cha-cha for the first
