centered and ready for you know a couple

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.700 
centered and ready for you know a couple
really<00:00:21.359> tough<00:00:21.600> sections<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.230> are<00:00:22.320> coming<00:00:22.590> up

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
really tough sections that are coming up

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.550 
really tough sections that are coming up
so<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.150> obstacle<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.230> come<00:00:25.410> into

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
so the first obstacle that we come into

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
so the first obstacle that we come into
is<00:00:25.800> sort<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.310> steep<00:00:26.580> drop<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.269> most

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
is sort of a really steep drop that most

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.300 
is sort of a really steep drop that most
people<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:27.930> taking<00:00:28.140> an<00:00:28.230> inside<00:00:28.560> line<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.859> down

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
people are taking an inside line on down

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.849 
people are taking an inside line on down
a<00:00:29.340> rock<00:00:29.699> face<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.410> onto<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
a rock face right here and then onto a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.900 
a rock face right here and then onto a
sort<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.550> bridge<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.180> raised<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.260> sort<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.910> I

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
sort of bridge and raised up sort of I

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
sort of bridge and raised up sort of I
guess<00:00:36.809> obstacle<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.469> avoid<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.890> water

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
guess obstacle to avoid some water

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
guess obstacle to avoid some water
accumulation<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> send<00:00:39.930> your

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
accumulation and then that send your

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
accumulation and then that send your
rake<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.500> another<00:00:41.040> boardwalk<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
rake down another boardwalk that then is

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
rake down another boardwalk that then is
into<00:00:42.420> two<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.899> tough<00:00:43.110> route<00:00:43.410> overs<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
into two really tough route overs that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.340 
into two really tough route overs that
are<00:00:44.940> sort<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.510> sprint<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.200> them

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
are sort of you know sprint into them

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
are sort of you know sprint into them
you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.039> ready<00:00:47.250> position<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> try<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.180> as

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you know ready position to try and go as

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.709 
you know ready position to try and go as
straight<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.149> continue<00:00:51.570> on

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
straight as you can and then continue on

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.939 
straight as you can and then continue on
and<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.230> tough<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> maintain

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and it's a really tough one to maintain

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
and it's a really tough one to maintain
momentum<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.879> sort<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> put<00:00:54.300> forth<00:00:54.539> those

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
momentum and sort of put forth those

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.650 
momentum and sort of put forth those
little<00:00:55.050> bursts<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> power<00:00:56.539> couple<00:00:57.539> more

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
little bursts of power couple more

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
little bursts of power couple more
boardwalks<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.530> we're<00:00:58.710> sort<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
boardwalks and then we're sort of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.430 
boardwalks and then we're sort of
sprinting<00:00:59.430> towards<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.390> last<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.870> popper

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sprinting towards the last little popper

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.399 
sprinting towards the last little popper
climb<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.719> technical<00:01:03.960> lots

people<00:01:40.430> go<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.730> right<00:01:40.880> there

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
people go to the right there

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.870 
people go to the right there
but<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.870> lot<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.230> guys<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:43.490> many<00:01:43.730> of<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
but a lot of the guys and many of the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.640 
but a lot of the guys and many of the
girls<00:01:44.090> will<00:01:44.240> go<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.260> left<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.620> just

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
girls will go to the left you just

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.320 
girls will go to the left you just
trying<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.010> that<00:01:46.160> drop<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:47.090> we're<00:01:47.210> into

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
trying to that drop and then we're into

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.730 
trying to that drop and then we're into
this<00:01:47.420> sort<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.690> mucky<00:01:48.020> stuff<00:01:48.290> that's<00:01:48.560> just

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
this sort of mucky stuff that's just

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.460 
this sort of mucky stuff that's just
really<00:01:49.010> really<00:01:49.130> bumpy<00:01:49.760> as<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.150> can<00:01:50.300> see<00:01:50.510> it's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
really really bumpy as you can see it's

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.930 
really really bumpy as you can see it's
easy<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.800> get<00:01:51.920> off<00:01:51.950> track<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.580> thrown<00:01:52.820> around

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
easy to get off track and thrown around

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.850 
easy to get off track and thrown around
and<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:53.990> sort<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.230> balance<00:01:54.710> between

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
and so it's sort of that balance between

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.920 
and so it's sort of that balance between
sort<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.520> helping<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.910> bike<00:01:56.060> over<00:01:56.210> stuff<00:01:56.600> and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
sort of helping a bike over stuff and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.120 
sort of helping a bike over stuff and
keeping<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.410> bike<00:01:57.530> moving<00:01:57.800> with<00:01:58.010> some

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
keeping the bike moving with some

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.730 
keeping the bike moving with some
cuddling<00:01:58.840> into<00:01:59.840> sort<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.140> weird<00:02:00.320> little

straight<00:02:27.410> lines<00:02:27.739> there<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.250> sort<00:02:28.610> of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
straight lines there it's sort of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
straight lines there it's sort of
challenges<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.269> stay<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.720> straight<00:02:30.019> and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
challenges to stay going straight and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.930 
challenges to stay going straight and
not<00:02:30.320> turning<00:02:30.620> into<00:02:30.769> every<00:02:31.010> little<00:02:31.250> rock<00:02:33.940> again

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940

not turning into every little rock again
just<00:02:35.150> pummeling<00:02:35.510> down<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.019> sort<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
just pummeling down this is sort of the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.320 
just pummeling down this is sort of the
wetter<00:02:36.680> stuff<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:37.610> past<00:02:37.880> years<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
wetter stuff and in past years and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.490 
wetter stuff and in past years and
they've<00:02:38.420> done<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.600> bunch<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.989> work<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
they've done a bunch of work with the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.740 
they've done a bunch of work with the
gravel<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.489> it's<00:02:40.640> not<00:02:40.790> too<00:02:40.940> bad<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.300> can

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
gravel so here it's not too bad you can

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.470 
gravel so here it's not too bad you can
flow<00:02:42.019> through<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.380> bunch<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:44.060> corners

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
flow through a bunch of the the corners

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.420 
flow through a bunch of the the corners
and<00:02:44.630> stuff<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.019> pretty<00:02:45.260> good<00:02:45.410> speed<00:02:45.800> not<00:02:46.400> a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and stuff with pretty good speed not a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.580 
and stuff with pretty good speed not a
lot<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.700> big<00:02:47.180> rocks<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.050> saw<00:02:48.260> us<00:02:48.320> go

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
lot of big rocks like you just saw us go

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.449 
lot of big rocks like you just saw us go
through<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.910> little<00:02:50.090> nicer<00:02:51.430> than<00:02:52.430> that

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
through so it's a little nicer than that

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.979 
through so it's a little nicer than that
you<00:02:52.790> started<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:53.300> fast<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.870> then

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
you started going really fast and then

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.720 
you started going really fast and then
dumps<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.560> really<00:02:54.830> hard<00:02:55.040> into<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.340> bunch<00:02:55.580> of

dumps you really hard into a bunch of
wetter<00:02:56.660> rocks<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.290> stuff<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.530> hasn't<00:02:57.830> been

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
wetter rocks and stuff that hasn't been

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.270 
wetter rocks and stuff that hasn't been
worked<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:58.459> as<00:02:58.610> much<00:02:59.680> against<00:03:00.680> are<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.130> going

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280

couple of berms that are a little a

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.869 
couple of berms that are a little a
little<00:04:06.150> tough<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.599> ride<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.340> certainly<00:04:08.340> some

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
little tough to ride but certainly some

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.970 
little tough to ride but certainly some
of<00:04:08.909> the<00:04:08.969> people<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.359> really<00:04:09.599> have<00:04:09.810> some<00:04:10.530> some

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
of the people that really have some some

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.039 
of the people that really have some some
mad<00:04:11.159> skills<00:04:11.400> or<00:04:11.790> ripping<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:12.569> pretty<00:04:12.840> hard

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
mad skills or ripping this pretty hard

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.690 
mad skills or ripping this pretty hard
and<00:04:13.560> really<00:04:13.680> using<00:04:14.040> those<00:04:14.159> berms<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.519> their

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and really using those berms to their

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.349 
and really using those berms to their
advantage<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.239> get<00:04:15.389> some<00:04:15.599> speed

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
advantage to get some speed

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.849 
advantage to get some speed
definitely<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.479> bottom<00:04:18.959> part<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.349> you<00:04:19.769> know

you'll<00:04:20.039> see<00:04:20.190> if<00:04:20.310> people<00:04:20.579> can<00:04:20.729> make<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> through

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
you'll see if people can make it through

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.240 
you'll see if people can make it through
some<00:04:21.659> of<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.780> text<00:04:22.199> up<00:04:22.289> at<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.470> top<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:22.710> you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
some of that text up at the top but you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.520 
some of that text up at the top but you
can<00:04:23.370> see<00:04:23.610> gaps<00:04:24.300> opening<00:04:24.780> up<00:04:24.900> as<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.169> fatigue

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
can see gaps opening up as the fatigue

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.070 
can see gaps opening up as the fatigue
and<00:04:25.710> stuff<00:04:25.889> sets<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.340> these<00:04:27.150> higher<00:04:27.690> speed

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
and stuff sets in these higher speed

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.990 
and stuff sets in these higher speed
sort<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.560> corners<00:04:28.949> you<00:04:29.220> know<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.430> people<00:04:29.970> that

can really rip them you know can really

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.520 
can really rip them you know can really
gain<00:04:32.039> some<00:04:32.070> time<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.960> brings<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.380> into
