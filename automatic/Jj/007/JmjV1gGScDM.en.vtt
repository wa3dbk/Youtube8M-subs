so<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> nutshell<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.899> problem

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
so in a nutshell this is the problem

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.459 
so in a nutshell this is the problem
with<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.740> Subaru<00:00:06.560> level<00:00:07.560> sender<00:00:08.450> here's<00:00:09.469> my

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
with the Subaru level sender here's my

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.009 
with the Subaru level sender here's my
multimeter<00:00:11.429> hooked<00:00:12.059> up<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> brand<00:00:12.750> new

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
multimeter hooked up to the brand new

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.340 
multimeter hooked up to the brand new
one<00:00:13.259> at<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.790> bottom<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.269> its<00:00:15.420> range<00:00:15.660> empty

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
one at the bottom of its range empty

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.910 
one at the bottom of its range empty
reads<00:00:16.920> about<00:00:17.039> 45<00:00:17.789> ohms<00:00:19.970> half<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.920> right

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
reads about 45 ohms half way right

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.109 
reads about 45 ohms half way right
around<00:00:23.039> half<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.080> 24<00:00:25.080> ish<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.730> all<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.029> way

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
around half that 24 ish and all the way

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
around half that 24 ish and all the way
at<00:00:27.240> full<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.990> reads<00:00:28.230> pretty<00:00:28.710> close<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.250> 0<00:00:29.519> like

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
at full it reads pretty close to 0 like

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.010 
at full it reads pretty close to 0 like
2<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.119> 3<00:00:30.269> ohms<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.830> nice<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.690> it's

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.310 

monotonic<00:00:37.020> through<00:00:37.829> its<00:00:37.980> range<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
monotonic through its range so as as it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
monotonic through its range so as as it
fills<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.700> only<00:00:42.000> goes<00:00:42.480> down<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:46.610> as<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
fills up it only goes down and as it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.279 
fills up it only goes down and as it
goes<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.239> full<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:49.710> empty<00:00:50.059> it's<00:00:51.059> slowly<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
goes from full to empty it's slowly and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
goes from full to empty it's slowly and
progressively<00:00:53.809> goes<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> 45<00:00:55.980> ish<00:00:56.280> 50<00:00:58.309> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
progressively goes up to 45 ish 50 so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
progressively goes up to 45 ish 50 so
let<00:00:59.489> me<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.699> hook<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> multimeter<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
let me just hook up the multimeter to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
let me just hook up the multimeter to
the<00:01:00.870> new<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.649> old<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.460> took<00:01:02.520> out

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the new to the old one that I took out

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:19.310 
the new to the old one that I took out
and<00:01:03.090> we'll<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> problem<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460 

so<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.440> old<00:01:20.620> lung<00:01:21.690> it's<00:01:22.690> all<00:01:22.810> hooked<00:01:23.050> up<00:01:23.260> with

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
so the old lung it's all hooked up with

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.620 
so the old lung it's all hooked up with
me<00:01:23.620> mr.<00:01:24.130> multimeter<00:01:24.580> bottom<00:01:25.300> of<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.450> range

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
me mr. multimeter bottom of the range

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.070 
me mr. multimeter bottom of the range
reads<00:01:26.260> empty<00:01:27.630> halfway<00:01:28.630> up

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
reads empty halfway up

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.700 
reads empty halfway up
it<00:01:29.860> reads<00:01:30.869> 35<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:34.840> recorders<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.440> way<00:01:35.560> up

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
it reads 35 two recorders of the way up

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.010 
it reads 35 two recorders of the way up
reads<00:01:36.520> twin<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.759> can<00:01:39.910> just<00:01:40.090> see<00:01:40.300> as<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.720> moves

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
reads twin you can just see as it moves

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.790 
reads twin you can just see as it moves
through<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.590> range<00:01:42.690> right<00:01:43.690> at<00:01:43.900> full<00:01:44.259> it<00:01:44.560> reads

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
through the range right at full it reads

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.609 
through the range right at full it reads
about<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.250> same<00:01:46.140> 6<00:01:47.140> ohms<00:01:47.440> rather<00:01:47.920> than<00:01:48.100> 4<00:01:49.619> but

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
about the same 6 ohms rather than 4 but

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
about the same 6 ohms rather than 4 but
you<00:01:50.740> see<00:01:50.950> as<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.190> slowly<00:01:51.729> go<00:01:52.240> down<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.720> range<00:01:56.610> 45

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.960 

178<00:02:00.880> like<00:02:01.119> 60<00:02:03.240> 287<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:06.430> doesn't<00:02:06.759> smoothly

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
178 like 60 287 it just doesn't smoothly

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.199 
178 like 60 287 it just doesn't smoothly
right<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.179> doesn't<00:02:10.360> smoothly<00:02:10.869> go<00:02:11.350> from<00:02:12.209> empty

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
right it doesn't smoothly go from empty

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.170 
right it doesn't smoothly go from empty
to<00:02:13.239> full<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.320> resistance<00:02:15.250> gets<00:02:15.489> stupidly

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
to full the resistance gets stupidly

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.920 
to full the resistance gets stupidly
high<00:02:17.040> partway<00:02:18.040> through<00:02:18.630> because<00:02:19.630> these

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
high partway through because these

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.860 
high partway through because these
little<00:02:20.470> contacts<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.620> float<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:25.330> this

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
little contacts that the float on this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.520 
little contacts that the float on this
variable<00:02:26.200> resistor<00:02:26.799> makes<00:02:27.010> contact<00:02:27.459> with<00:02:27.760> I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
variable resistor makes contact with I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.199 
variable resistor makes contact with I
don't<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.950> if<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.400> see<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.820> let's<00:02:31.090> try

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
don't know if you can see that let's try

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.039 
don't know if you can see that let's try
focusing<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.130> these<00:02:33.280> little<00:02:33.430> contacts<00:02:34.269> get

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
focusing so these little contacts get

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.110 
focusing so these little contacts get
dirty<00:02:35.440> from<00:02:35.590> all<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.100> stuff<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> gasoline

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
dirty from all the stuff in the gasoline

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.310 
dirty from all the stuff in the gasoline
and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.700> resistance<00:02:39.970> doesn't<00:02:40.930> read

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
and then the resistance doesn't read

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.530 
and then the resistance doesn't read
what<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:41.709> supposed<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.640> slowly<00:02:43.090> moves

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
what it's supposed to is it slowly moves

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.069 
what it's supposed to is it slowly moves
through<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.989> tank<00:02:44.910> right<00:02:45.910> if<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.900> always

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
through the tank right if you always

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.800 
through the tank right if you always
keep<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.380> tank<00:02:47.709> around<00:02:48.040> half<00:02:48.430> full<00:02:48.850> back<00:02:49.600> and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
keep the tank around half full back and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.759 
keep the tank around half full back and
forth<00:02:50.019> back<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.290> forth

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
forth back and forth

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.759 
forth back and forth
those<00:02:51.549> little<00:02:51.820> contacts<00:02:52.630> well<00:02:53.350> it's<00:02:53.590> empty

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
those little contacts well it's empty

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.759 
those little contacts well it's empty
it's<00:02:54.340> over<00:02:54.850> full<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.380> know<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:56.650> just

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
it's over full it's you know it's just

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.050 
it's over full it's you know it's just
crazy<00:02:57.400> sauce<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.510> I've<00:02:59.579> cleaned<00:03:00.579> these<00:03:00.790> once

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
crazy sauce so I've cleaned these once

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060 
crazy sauce so I've cleaned these once
already<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.630> only<00:03:01.930> solution<00:03:02.410> really<00:03:02.829> seems

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
already the only solution really seems

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.120 
already the only solution really seems
