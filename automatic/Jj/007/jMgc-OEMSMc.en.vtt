them a really well-rounded view of a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.240 
them a really well-rounded view of a
show<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.720> has<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.590> many<00:04:01.680> different<00:04:01.950> phases

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
show that has so many different phases

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.910 
show that has so many different phases
of<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.910> if<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:03.750> can<00:04:04.200> sort<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.500> give<00:04:04.620> them<00:04:04.799> a

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
mean that's a successful coverage

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.220 
mean that's a successful coverage
how<00:04:09.160> do<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.459> find<00:04:09.700> success<00:04:10.090> being<00:04:10.959> invited

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
how do you find success being invited

back to present again next time okay how
would<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.070> define<00:04:18.489> success<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.419> covering<00:04:19.720> an

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
would I define success and covering an

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.219 
would I define success and covering an
auto<00:04:19.959> show<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.760> know<00:04:21.880> partly<00:04:22.540> it's<00:04:22.690> it's<00:04:22.990> I

you know for me it's it's really the
quality<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.130> what<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:33.460> do<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.970> makes<00:04:34.210> me

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
quality of what we do that makes me

happy if i could look at the stories
that<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.490> wrote<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.150> see<00:04:37.750> that<00:04:37.990> we're<00:04:38.620> doing

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
that we wrote and see that we're doing

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.100 
that we wrote and see that we're doing
more<00:04:39.580> than<00:04:39.610> regurgitating<00:04:40.419> press<00:04:40.750> releases

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
more than regurgitating press releases

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.480 
more than regurgitating press releases
we're<00:04:41.410> actually<00:04:41.560> going<00:04:41.919> out<00:04:42.160> there<00:04:42.460> and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
we're actually going out there and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.550 
we're actually going out there and
talking<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.270> people<00:04:43.570> from<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.810> manufacturers

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
talking to people from the manufacturers

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.590 
talking to people from the manufacturers
and<00:04:44.770> maybe<00:04:45.460> getting<00:04:45.729> some<00:04:45.850> bits<00:04:46.479> of

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
and maybe getting some bits of

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.450 
and maybe getting some bits of
information<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:47.290> aren't<00:04:48.220> immediately

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
information that aren't immediately

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.070 
information that aren't immediately
apparent<00:04:48.729> about<00:04:49.330> cars<00:04:49.570> i<00:04:49.750> think<00:04:49.930> that's

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
apparent about cars i think that's

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.890 
apparent about cars i think that's
really<00:04:50.229> cool<00:04:50.620> for<00:04:51.580> me<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:51.970> defines<00:04:52.660> success

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
really cool for me that defines success

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.270 
really cool for me that defines success
so<00:04:53.350> it's<00:04:53.530> quantity<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.550> quality<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:55.030> guess
