early in the racing career to go against
you<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.370> some<00:00:45.180> old<00:00:45.360> veterans<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.050> are

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
slugged it out for a long time so I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.290 
slugged it out for a long time so I
think<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.620> mean<00:00:49.860> either<00:00:50.129> ways<00:00:50.430> fine<00:00:50.460> by<00:00:50.940> me<00:00:51.090> but

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
think I mean either ways fine by me but

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
think I mean either ways fine by me but
I<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> would<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.020> cool<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.710> all

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I think it would be cool to have for all

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.330 
I think it would be cool to have for all
its<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.460> separate<00:00:54.050> well<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.289> don't<00:00:56.100> know

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
its little separate well I don't know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
its little separate well I don't know
it's<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.510> been<00:00:57.660> something<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.050> happened

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it's it's been something that's happened

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's it's been something that's happened
for<00:00:58.710> years<00:00:58.859> once<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.430> turn<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.940> they

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
for years once they turn for they

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.670 
for years once they turn for they
consider<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> age<00:01:00.780> tours<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.350> racing

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
consider the age tours at the racing

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
consider the age tours at the racing
against<00:01:01.980> age<00:01:02.100> horses<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.449> record

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
against age horses it's it's a record

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
against age horses it's it's a record
that<00:01:03.899> should<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.409> marked<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.189> an<00:01:05.309> age

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that should just be marked as an age

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.240 
that should just be marked as an age
stores<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.510> no<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.130> i

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
stores that's at no I don't think so i

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
stores that's at no I don't think so i
think<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.640> good<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:10.320> know

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
think it's good the way it is you know

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
to get up against the older horses you
know<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> big<00:01:20.460> jump<00:01:20.670> somewhere<00:01:21.090> 67<00:01:21.810> years

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
know it's a big jump somewhere 67 years

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
know it's a big jump somewhere 67 years
old<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.530> tough<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> race<00:01:23.340> against

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
old it's tough for them to race against

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
old it's tough for them to race against
i<00:01:23.939> would<00:01:24.540> say<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> should<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
i would say it should be i think so you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.749 
i would say it should be i think so you
know<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.000> tough<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:28.520> when<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
know it's tough when they when you get a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
know it's tough when they when you get a
four<00:01:30.000> year<00:01:30.119> old<00:01:30.240> racing<00:01:30.659> against<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.020> horse's

four year old racing against a horse's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.640 
four year old racing against a horse's
there's<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> may<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> big<00:01:32.640> difference<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
there's a may a big difference a lot of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.050 
there's a may a big difference a lot of
people<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.220> realize<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.640> much<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
people don't realize how much a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999 
people don't realize how much a
difference<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> does<00:01:37.439> make<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> big

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
difference it is but it does make a big

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280 
difference it is but it does make a big
difference<00:01:38.479> no<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.960> once

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
difference no I don't think so once

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
difference no I don't think so once
before<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> considered<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:41.400> aged<00:01:41.549> horse<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
before the considered an aged horse and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
before the considered an aged horse and
I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.350> should<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.560> grouped<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I think that they should be grouped to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.350 
I think that they should be grouped to
sit<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.840> used<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> think<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.360> now

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
sit with them I used to think so but now

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
sit with them I used to think so but now
the<00:01:48.420> four<00:01:48.720> year<00:01:48.840> olds<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the four year olds are going with the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.950 
the four year olds are going with the
age<00:01:49.890> sources<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> big<00:01:51.540> difference

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
age sources so it's not a big difference

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
age sources so it's not a big difference
in<00:01:52.079> where<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> seems<00:01:53.369> like

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
in where it's not I don't it seems like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
in where it's not I don't it seems like
it's<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> huge<00:01:54.630> jump<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.409> anymore

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
it's not a huge jump up for them anymore

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's not a huge jump up for them anymore
you<00:01:55.770> know<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:55.979> used<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> big<00:01:56.490> deal<00:01:56.610> for

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you know they used to be a big deal for

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
you know they used to be a big deal for
a<00:01:56.880> four<00:01:57.090> year<00:01:57.210> old<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> source<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.200> even<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
a four year old to be a source or even a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.709 
a four year old to be a source or even a
three<00:01:58.560> year<00:01:58.680> old<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.759> they're<00:02:00.030> they're

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
three year old but now they're they're

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
three year old but now they're they're
going<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.110> fast<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.009> four<00:02:02.250> year<00:02:02.340> olds<00:02:02.460> are

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
going so fast and the four year olds are

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160 
going so fast and the four year olds are
keeping<00:02:02.759> right<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.299> being<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> most<00:02:03.840> Amaro

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
keeping right up or being the most Amaro

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
keeping right up or being the most Amaro
no<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> don't<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.250> i<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
no I don't think so i think you know you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.290 
no I don't think so i think you know you
got<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.259> three<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.799> h

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
got your two or three and then h

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.860 
got your two or three and then h
horses<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.690> think<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.140> think<00:02:10.100> that's<00:02:10.310> good<00:02:10.870> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
horses I think I think that's good I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.500 
horses I think I think that's good I
know<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.560> don't<00:02:12.740> think<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.970> know<00:02:14.090> once<00:02:14.360> your

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
know I don't think so you know once your

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
know I don't think so you know once your
for<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.020> kind<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:15.950> unfortunately<00:02:16.490> you

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
for you kind of it is unfortunately you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.310 
for you kind of it is unfortunately you
have<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.730> race<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.240> older<00:02:17.480> horses<00:02:17.750> right<00:02:18.050> but

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
have to race the older horses right but

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.410 
have to race the older horses right but
you<00:02:19.220> know<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> good<00:02:19.790> step<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.210> for

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
you know I think it's a good step up for

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.360 
you know I think it's a good step up for
them<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.720> know<00:02:20.810> they<00:02:20.840> erase<00:02:21.830> older<00:02:22.100> horses

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
them you know they erase older horses

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.400 
them you know they erase older horses
and<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.270> know<00:02:23.360> they're<00:02:23.510> been<00:02:24.080> doing<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.350> a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
and you know they're been doing it a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.110 
and you know they're been doing it a
long<00:02:24.440> time<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.550> good<00:02:25.880> for<00:02:26.030> them

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
long time so I think it's good for them

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.670 
long time so I think it's good for them
to<00:02:26.150> race<00:02:26.330> older<00:02:26.600> horses<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.140> don't<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.620> we

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
to race older horses I don't think we

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.770 
to race older horses I don't think we
need<00:02:27.800> separate<00:02:28.340> world<00:02:28.520> records<00:02:28.940> but<00:02:29.240> separate

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
need separate world records but separate

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.540 
need separate world records but separate
races<00:02:29.990> for<00:02:30.380> them<00:02:30.530> if<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.280> bring<00:02:31.370> them

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
races for them if we have to bring them

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.690 
races for them if we have to bring them
back<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.820> race<00:02:31.970> would<00:02:32.150> be<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> ideal<00:02:32.780> thing<00:02:33.050> I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
back to race would be the ideal thing I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.160 
back to race would be the ideal thing I
wish<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.000> there<00:02:35.150> were<00:02:35.300> more<00:02:35.480> races<00:02:35.930> for

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
wish that there were more races for

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.900 
wish that there were more races for
four-year-olds<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.190> were<00:02:37.310> more<00:02:37.340> races

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
four-year-olds if there were more races

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.700 
four-year-olds if there were more races
for<00:02:38.090> four-year-olds<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.780> could<00:02:39.020> more<00:02:39.200> justify

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
for four-year-olds I could more justify

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.700 
for four-year-olds I could more justify
that<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.700> hope<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.870> know<00:02:41.990> now<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.410> we're

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
that I hope that you know now that we're

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.650 
that I hope that you know now that we're
keeping<00:02:42.890> our<00:02:43.280> four<00:02:43.760> year<00:02:43.850> olds<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.390> track

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
keeping our four year olds on the track

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.930 
keeping our four year olds on the track
or<00:02:44.930> more<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.320> three-year-olds<00:02:46.040> are<00:02:46.220> racing<00:02:46.790> as

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
or more of three-year-olds are racing as

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.290 
or more of three-year-olds are racing as
four-year-olds<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:47.540> think<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:49.210> mean<00:02:50.210> we

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
four-year-olds I think that I mean we

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.620 
four-year-olds I think that I mean we
should<00:02:50.510> keep<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.850> more<00:02:52.850> foiled<00:02:53.270> races

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
should keep it but if more foiled races

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.450 
should keep it but if more foiled races
aren't<00:02:53.900> made<00:02:54.230> their<00:02:54.500> racing<00:02:54.920> against<00:02:55.280> age

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
aren't made their racing against age

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.970 
aren't made their racing against age
horses<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.240> in<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.930> case<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.590> think<00:02:57.620> that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
horses and in that case I think that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.980 
horses and in that case I think that
they<00:02:58.130> could<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.400> away<00:02:58.550> with<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.120> think<00:02:59.840> so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
they could do away with it I think so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.690 
they could do away with it I think so
because<00:03:00.290> they're<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> different<00:03:00.770> different

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
because they're a different different

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.360 
because they're a different different
group<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.380> they're<00:03:03.380> grading<00:03:03.770> more<00:03:03.920> racist

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
group and they're grading more racist

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.530 
group and they're grading more racist
for<00:03:04.490> four<00:03:04.550> year<00:03:04.880> old<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.150> they<00:03:05.270> should<00:03:05.420> have

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
for four year old so they should have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.470 
for four year old so they should have
their<00:03:05.660> own<00:03:05.720> records<00:03:06.730> for<00:03:07.730> sure<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> think<00:03:08.390> we

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
their own records for sure I think we

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.090 
their own records for sure I think we
definitely<00:03:08.600> more<00:03:09.350> stakes<00:03:09.620> races<00:03:09.890> as

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
definitely more stakes races as

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.530 
definitely more stakes races as
four-year-olds<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.910> would<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.330> more

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
four-year-olds and that would with more

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.090 
four-year-olds and that would with more
steak<00:03:11.750> races<00:03:12.110> would<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.410> more<00:03:12.650> different

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
steak races would be more different

understand what a transition it is from

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.490 
understand what a transition it is from
a<00:03:20.360> three<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.720> four<00:03:20.930> year<00:03:21.050> old<00:03:21.140> against<00:03:21.350> those

a three to four year old against those
aged<00:03:21.739> horses<00:03:22.280> I've<00:03:23.180> had<00:03:23.390> some<00:03:23.600> luck<00:03:23.780> with<00:03:23.959> it

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
aged horses I've had some luck with it

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.540 
aged horses I've had some luck with it
with<00:03:24.230> horses<00:03:24.470> like<00:03:24.650> better<00:03:24.830> than<00:03:24.980> cheddar<00:03:25.220> and

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
with horses like better than cheddar and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.130 
with horses like better than cheddar and
moving<00:03:25.820> pictures<00:03:26.180> were<00:03:26.330> phenomenal<00:03:26.600> at<00:03:26.900> four

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
moving pictures were phenomenal at four

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.350 
moving pictures were phenomenal at four
but<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:28.220> doesn't<00:03:28.459> happen<00:03:28.610> off<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:29.150> very

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
but it doesn't happen off and it's very

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.600 
but it doesn't happen off and it's very
tough<00:03:29.630> on<00:03:29.810> them<00:03:29.959> well<00:03:30.830> i'd<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.130> see<00:03:31.250> four

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
tough on them well i'd like to see four

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.490 
tough on them well i'd like to see four
year<00:03:31.730> olds<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.000> their<00:03:32.180> own<00:03:32.209> division<00:03:32.510> to

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
year olds have their own division to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.530 
year olds have their own division to
race<00:03:33.650> against<00:03:33.920> four<00:03:34.160> year<00:03:34.250> olds<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.550> think<00:03:34.820> you

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
race against four year olds I think you

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.740 
race against four year olds I think you
know<00:03:35.630> last<00:03:35.870> year<00:03:36.020> were<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:36.470> need<00:03:36.680> e<00:03:37.090> when<00:03:38.090> you

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
know last year were we need e when you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.540 
know last year were we need e when you
know<00:03:38.870> my<00:03:39.020> dad<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.440> were<00:03:39.620> had<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> big<00:03:40.220> part<00:03:40.459> in

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
know my dad and I were had a big part in

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.930 
know my dad and I were had a big part in
the<00:03:40.670> horse<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.989> know<00:03:42.080> I<00:03:42.110> think<00:03:42.890> he<00:03:43.820> would

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the horse and you know I think he would

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.340 
the horse and you know I think he would
have<00:03:44.030> been<00:03:44.120> much<00:03:44.330> better<00:03:44.390> served<00:03:44.840> racing<00:03:45.230> as

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
have been much better served racing as

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.690 
have been much better served racing as
other<00:03:45.650> four<00:03:45.920> year<00:03:46.040> olds<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.489> think<00:03:46.640> he

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
other four year olds and I think he

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.820 
other four year olds and I think he
would<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:46.880> had<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> huge<00:03:47.209> year<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.630> think<00:03:48.050> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
would have had a huge year I think you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.470 
would have had a huge year I think you
know<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.040> such<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.400> huge<00:03:49.730> transition<00:03:50.120> you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
know it's such a huge transition you

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.760 
know it's such a huge transition you
just<00:03:50.630> don't<00:03:50.780> see<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> lot<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.140> horses<00:03:51.350> doing<00:03:51.680> it

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
just don't see a lot of horses doing it

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.620 
just don't see a lot of horses doing it
there<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.060> exception<00:03:53.480> of

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
there is a there is that exception of

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.540 
there is a there is that exception of
horses<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.020> can<00:03:54.170> do<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.380> can<00:03:55.010> switch<00:03:55.220> over<00:03:55.459> from

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
horses I can do it can switch over from

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.190 
horses I can do it can switch over from
three<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.940> four<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.330> race<00:03:56.690> against<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> age

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
three to four and race against the age

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.229 
three to four and race against the age
but<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.470> really<00:03:57.709> believe<00:03:57.920> that<00:03:57.950> we<00:03:58.850> roll<00:03:59.060> should

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
but I really believe that we roll should

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.400 
but I really believe that we roll should
have<00:03:59.330> their<00:03:59.450> own<00:03:59.480> division<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.050> like<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.260> two

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
have their own division just like a two

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.600 
have their own division just like a two
and<00:04:00.530> three-year-old<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.130> then<00:04:01.220> be<00:04:01.400> aged

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
and three-year-old and then be aged

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:10.780 
and three-year-old and then be aged
after<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.300> four-year-old<00:04:02.720> year

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.039 

should<00:04:11.790> geldings<00:04:12.209> have<00:04:12.450> separate<00:04:12.810> track

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
should geldings have separate track

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.380 
should geldings have separate track
records<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.890> world<00:04:14.220> records<00:04:14.580> from<00:04:14.730> Colts<00:04:15.180> why

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
records and world records from Colts why

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.539 
records and world records from Colts why
why<00:04:15.629> not<00:04:15.810> no<00:04:16.560> i<00:04:16.590> don't<00:04:16.799> i<00:04:17.070> don't<00:04:17.130> think<00:04:17.430> it

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
why not no i don't i don't think it

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.530 
why not no i don't i don't think it
makes<00:04:18.389> much<00:04:18.630> much<00:04:19.169> difference<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.799> way<00:04:20.540> you

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
makes much much difference that way you

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.230 
makes much much difference that way you
know<00:04:21.630> get<00:04:22.530> gallo<00:04:23.070> blue<00:04:23.370> chip<00:04:23.580> was<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> gelding

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
know get gallo blue chip was a gelding

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.060 
know get gallo blue chip was a gelding
and<00:04:24.360> he<00:04:24.449> was<00:04:24.570> as<00:04:24.690> good<00:04:24.840> as<00:04:24.990> any<00:04:25.020> stud<00:04:25.620> I'd<00:04:25.830> seen

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and he was as good as any stud I'd seen

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.650 
and he was as good as any stud I'd seen
and<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.729> know<00:04:26.850> I've<00:04:27.120> seen<00:04:27.270> lots<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.510> good

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
and you know I've seen lots of good

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.909 
and you know I've seen lots of good
studs<00:04:27.930> through<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.260> don't<00:04:28.710> think<00:04:28.830> that

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
studs through so I don't think that

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.150 
studs through so I don't think that
makes<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.190> big<00:04:29.340> difference<00:04:29.370> now<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:31.100> don't<00:04:32.100> think

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
makes a big difference now I don't think

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.420 
makes a big difference now I don't think
it<00:04:32.340> matters<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.820> mean<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.090> good<00:04:34.040> maybe<00:04:35.040> maybe

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it matters I mean it's good maybe maybe

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.159 
it matters I mean it's good maybe maybe
it'd<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.639> good<00:04:35.760> for<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.210> if<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.690> gelding<00:04:37.050> was

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
it'd be good for the if a gelding was

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.409 
it'd be good for the if a gelding was
faster<00:04:37.590> than<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.800> stud<00:04:38.310> first<00:04:38.940> said<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.360> a

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
faster than a stud first said to have a

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.090 
faster than a stud first said to have a
big<00:04:39.600> mark<00:04:39.840> like<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.410> world<00:04:40.620> record<00:04:40.979> or

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
big mark like that and world record or

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.770 
big mark like that and world record or
whatever<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.880> don't<00:04:42.419> think<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.660> matters

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
whatever but I don't think it matters

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.469 
whatever but I don't think it matters
really<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:44.070> relevant<00:04:44.760> like<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.060> mean<00:04:45.240> a

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
really it's it's relevant like I mean a

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.270 
really it's it's relevant like I mean a
great<00:04:45.870> horse<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.260> great<00:04:46.470> horse<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.979> like<00:04:47.130> if

that's fine I'd sooner have a check at

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.070 
that's fine I'd sooner have a check at
the<00:04:50.340> end<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.729> day<00:04:50.880> than<00:04:51.090> B&amp;N<00:04:51.479> he<00:04:51.630> any

record but I mean if somebody's after

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.850 
record but I mean if somebody's after
that<00:04:54.419> kind<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.720> glory<00:04:54.960> that's<00:04:55.199> terrific<00:04:55.470> and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
that kind of glory that's terrific and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.860 
that kind of glory that's terrific and
yeah<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.310> gilding<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:56.910> stud<00:04:57.539> could<00:04:57.750> have

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
yeah a gilding and stud could have

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.670 
yeah a gilding and stud could have
different<00:04:58.199> world<00:04:58.410> records<00:04:58.770> ah<00:05:00.229> no<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.260> don't

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
different world records ah no I don't

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.770 
different world records ah no I don't
think<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:02.100> don't<00:05:02.370> think<00:05:02.580> that's<00:05:02.780> substantial

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
think I don't think that's substantial

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.210 
think I don't think that's substantial
either<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.199> think<00:05:04.500> they<00:05:04.620> should<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:05.010> all

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
either I think they should be all

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.360 
either I think they should be all
categorized<00:05:05.820> together<00:05:06.560> they're<00:05:07.560> both<00:05:08.070> males

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
categorized together they're both males

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.750 
categorized together they're both males
I<00:05:09.139> don't<00:05:10.139> think<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:10.410> geldings<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.280> coats<00:05:11.460> it

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
I don't think so geldings and coats it

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.080 
I don't think so geldings and coats it
should<00:05:11.910> be<00:05:12.030> all<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.270> same<00:05:12.450> I<00:05:12.750> don't<00:05:13.410> think<00:05:13.470> so

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
should be all the same I don't think so

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.210 
should be all the same I don't think so
geldings<00:05:15.090> are<00:05:15.419> studs<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:15.990> think<00:05:16.229> they<00:05:16.470> race

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
geldings are studs I think they race

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.070 
geldings are studs I think they race
together<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:17.940> I<00:05:18.090> think<00:05:18.389> they<00:05:18.660> should<00:05:18.900> be

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
together and I think they should be

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.670 
together and I think they should be
counted<00:05:20.070> as<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.910> horse<00:05:21.389> all<00:05:21.690> together<00:05:21.840> no<00:05:22.650> I

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
counted as a horse all together no I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.409 
counted as a horse all together no I
don't<00:05:22.919> believe<00:05:22.979> so<00:05:23.099> again<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.090> think<00:05:24.270> they're

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
don't believe so again I think they're

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.900 
don't believe so again I think they're
all<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.840> same<00:05:24.870> group<00:05:25.229> gelding<00:05:25.979> stallion<00:05:26.400> they

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
all the same group gelding stallion they

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.029 
all the same group gelding stallion they
should<00:05:27.090> be<00:05:27.120> grouped<00:05:27.389> together<00:05:27.770> yeah<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.800> guess

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
should be grouped together yeah I guess

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.620 
should be grouped together yeah I guess
I<00:05:29.220> don't<00:05:29.370> mind<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.610> cuz<00:05:30.030> that's<00:05:30.240> how<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.510> is

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
I don't mind that cuz that's how it is

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.200 
I don't mind that cuz that's how it is
right<00:05:30.660> now<00:05:30.900> obviously<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:31.560> uh<00:05:31.590> that's<00:05:32.490> it

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
right now obviously so uh that's it

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.940 
right now obviously so uh that's it
doesn't<00:05:33.840> matter<00:05:33.990> doesn't<00:05:34.349> matter<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.650> me<00:05:34.680> I

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
doesn't matter doesn't matter to me I

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.550 
doesn't matter doesn't matter to me I
don't<00:05:35.610> think<00:05:35.669> so<00:05:35.880> again<00:05:36.300> I<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:37.320> know<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.470> think

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
don't think so again I you know I think

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.890 
don't think so again I you know I think
we<00:05:37.889> go<00:05:38.070> too<00:05:38.130> far<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.700> way<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:39.180> think<00:05:39.810> they

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
we go too far that way I think they

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.450 
we go too far that way I think they
should<00:05:40.110> maybe<00:05:40.229> have<00:05:40.440> separate<00:05:40.830> World<00:05:41.010> Records

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
should maybe have separate World Records

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.400 
should maybe have separate World Records
that's<00:05:41.789> maybe<00:05:42.270> maybe<00:05:42.570> not<00:05:42.690> separate<00:05:43.139> tracks

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
that's maybe maybe not separate tracks

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.080 
that's maybe maybe not separate tracks
but<00:05:43.710> there<00:05:44.130> should<00:05:44.280> be<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.370> world<00:05:44.610> record<00:05:44.700> for<00:05:45.060> a

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
but there should be a world record for a

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.580 
but there should be a world record for a
galloping<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:45.599> world<00:05:45.870> record<00:05:46.139> for<00:05:46.320> a<00:05:46.349> cold

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
galloping and world record for a cold

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.670 
galloping and world record for a cold
mushy<00:05:47.120> now<00:05:48.120> they're<00:05:48.539> still<00:05:48.750> male<00:05:48.990> no

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
mushy now they're still male no

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.089 
mushy now they're still male no
difference<00:05:50.070> um<00:05:51.229> no<00:05:52.229> I<00:05:52.560> don't<00:05:52.860> think<00:05:52.919> so

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
difference um no I don't think so

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.469 
difference um no I don't think so
because<00:05:53.370> we've<00:05:53.639> raised<00:05:53.880> colts<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.389> geldings

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
because we've raised colts and geldings

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.770 
because we've raised colts and geldings
together<00:05:55.320> so<00:05:55.830> i<00:05:56.130> don't<00:05:56.400> really<00:05:56.660> think<00:05:57.660> that

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
together so i don't really think that

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.719 
together so i don't really think that
there's<00:05:58.110> any<00:05:58.349> justification<00:05:59.160> to<00:05:59.190> separating

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
there's any justification to separating

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.010 
there's any justification to separating
their<00:06:00.030> of<00:06:00.150> times<00:06:02.300> yeah<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.360> guess<00:06:03.660> so<00:06:03.870> they

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
their of times yeah I guess so they

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.830 
their of times yeah I guess so they
always<00:06:04.620> did<00:06:04.830> have<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:05.690> different<00:06:06.690> were

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
always did have the different were

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.320 
always did have the different were
records<00:06:07.500> in<00:06:07.800> World<00:06:07.979> Records<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:08.610> I<00:06:08.639> think<00:06:09.090> they

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
records in World Records so I think they

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.570 
records in World Records so I think they
should<00:06:09.539> still<00:06:09.840> have<00:06:10.050> them

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
should still have them

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.149 
should still have them
I<00:06:10.930> don't<00:06:11.930> know<00:06:12.080> about<00:06:12.199> that<00:06:12.289> 1i<00:06:12.650> probably<00:06:13.039> want

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
I don't know about that 1i probably want

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:14.290 
I don't know about that 1i probably want
to<00:06:13.189> agree<00:06:13.340> with<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.550> long<00:06:13.819> as<00:06:13.970> I<00:06:14.060> think

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
to agree with that long as I think

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.309 
to agree with that long as I think
gelding<00:06:14.689> stallion<00:06:15.970> no<00:06:16.970> I<00:06:17.240> say<00:06:17.539> no<00:06:17.720> ads<00:06:18.139> at

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
gelding stallion no I say no ads at

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.050 
gelding stallion no I say no ads at
exactly<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.129> same<00:06:19.159> thing<00:06:19.580> whether<00:06:19.789> they're<00:06:20.030> a

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
exactly the same thing whether they're a

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.390 
exactly the same thing whether they're a
stud<00:06:20.389> or<00:06:20.419> not<00:06:20.680> no<00:06:21.680> I<00:06:21.710> don't<00:06:21.949> think<00:06:22.009> so<00:06:22.159> i<00:06:22.310> think

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
stud or not no I don't think so i think

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.369 
stud or not no I don't think so i think
a<00:06:23.000> horse<00:06:23.419> is<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.599> horse<00:06:23.659> whether<00:06:24.199> he's<00:06:24.349> a

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
a horse is a horse whether he's a

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.129 
a horse is a horse whether he's a
gelding<00:06:24.800> or<00:06:24.919> a<00:06:24.949> stud<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:26.240> know<00:06:26.360> it's<00:06:26.539> a<00:06:26.719> it's<00:06:26.750> a

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
gelding or a stud you know it's a it's a

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.110 
gelding or a stud you know it's a it's a
it's<00:06:27.169> a<00:06:27.469> tactic<00:06:28.099> i<00:06:28.189> guess<00:06:28.340> we<00:06:28.520> use<00:06:28.699> as<00:06:28.909> horse

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
it's a tactic i guess we use as horse
