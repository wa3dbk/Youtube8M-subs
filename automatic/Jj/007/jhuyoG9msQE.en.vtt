00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
t-bolt here was very nice to get that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.399 
t-bolt here was very nice to get that
damage<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> scissor<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.960> he's<00:01:46.140> obviously

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
damage on the scissor so he's obviously

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.100 
damage on the scissor so he's obviously
I'm<00:01:46.970> assuming<00:01:47.970> he's<00:01:48.149> banded<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.720> mean<00:01:48.960> that's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I'm assuming he's banded I mean that's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.499 
I'm assuming he's banded I mean that's
that's<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.829> sees<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.399> versus<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.240> sorry

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that's what sees or is versus are sorry

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.830 
that's what sees or is versus are sorry
and<00:01:52.610> he's<00:01:53.610> gonna<00:01:53.759> kill<00:01:54.000> me<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> u-turn

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and he's gonna kill me with the u-turn

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
and he's gonna kill me with the u-turn
so<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.470> kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> sucked<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.430> wasn't

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so that kind of sucked but there wasn't

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
so that kind of sucked but there wasn't
really<00:01:56.700> much<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.689> could<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.229> into

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
really much I can do I could go into

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.289 
really much I can do I could go into
pidgeot<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.729> had<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> feeling<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
pidgeot but I just had a feeling that I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.420 
pidgeot but I just had a feeling that I
would<00:02:00.479> need<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> guy<00:02:00.899> later<00:02:01.250> during<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
would need that guy later during that

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280 
would need that guy later during that
he's<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> scarf<00:02:03.180> kinga<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:03.780> he<00:02:03.899> ends<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.140> not

he's a scarf kinga which he ends up not

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
he's a scarf kinga which he ends up not
being<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.009> thought<00:02:05.520> he<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.729> scarf<00:02:05.969> from

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119

that 40 prediction I think that was the
game<00:05:34.020> changer<00:05:34.440> that<00:05:34.470> was<00:05:34.710> when<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.950> really<00:05:35.700> took
