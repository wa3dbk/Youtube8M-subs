exactly<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:11.720> he's<00:02:11.840> trying<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.140> lineup<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
exactly so he's trying to lineup on the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.979 
exactly so he's trying to lineup on the
inside<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.220> take<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.580> explosive<00:02:13.970> step<00:02:14.420> now

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
inside you take that explosive step now

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.290 
inside you take that explosive step now
where<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.650> ideal<00:02:16.040> place<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.310> be<00:02:16.550> doing<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.910> so

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
where is ideal place to be doing that so

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.930 
where is ideal place to be doing that so
I<00:02:17.630> get<00:02:18.080> here<00:02:18.440> probably<00:02:19.250> bringing<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> cross

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
I get here probably bringing the cross

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.620 
I get here probably bringing the cross
yeah

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

looking to go straight so we're looking
to<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:31.370> forward<00:02:31.730> all<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> time<00:02:37.329> now<00:02:38.329> that

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
to go forward all the time now that

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.210 
to go forward all the time now that
we've<00:02:38.599> done<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.810> power<00:02:39.230> step<00:02:39.560> let's<00:02:40.010> just

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
we've done that power step let's just

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.809 
we've done that power step let's just
walk<00:02:40.370> through<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.640> again<00:02:41.380> run<00:02:42.380> our<00:02:42.500> step<00:02:42.819> what

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
walk through it again run our step what

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.449 
walk through it again run our step what
else<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.239> add<00:02:44.269> right<00:02:44.630> here

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
else can we add right here

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.870 
else can we add right here
okay<00:02:46.790> let's<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:47.120> walk<00:02:47.299> through<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:51.880> good

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
okay let's just walk through that good

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.630 
okay let's just walk through that good
all<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.769> had<00:02:54.890> defend<00:02:55.280> we<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.519> add

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
all right so we had defend we can add

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.160 
all right so we had defend we can add
the<00:02:55.760> fend<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.180> which<00:02:56.390> helps<00:02:56.660> us<00:02:56.750> win<00:02:57.019> that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
the fend in which helps us win that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380 
the fend in which helps us win that
collision<00:02:57.470> our<00:02:58.069> power<00:02:58.340> step<00:02:58.700> gets<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.299> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
collision our power step gets on the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.210 
collision our power step gets on the
weak<00:02:59.510> shoulder<00:02:59.989> finish<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.769> off<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.069> good

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.240 
yeah good yeah that was good guys I
think<00:04:06.690> what<00:04:07.290> we're<00:04:07.440> working<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.799> there<00:04:08.069> is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
think what we're working on there is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.340 
think what we're working on there is
that<00:04:08.760> explosiveness<00:04:09.480> around<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> contact

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
that explosiveness around the contact

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.259 
that explosiveness around the contact
area<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.650> think<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:10.890> notice<00:04:11.190> if<00:04:11.370> you're<00:04:12.000> get<00:04:12.150> in

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
area I think you notice if you're get in

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.390 
area I think you notice if you're get in
there<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.630> use<00:04:12.780> your<00:04:12.959> fast<00:04:13.170> feet<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:14.130> gives<00:04:14.310> us

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
there you use your fast feet it gives us

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.559 
there you use your fast feet it gives us
a<00:04:14.459> greater<00:04:14.670> opportunity<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.299> win<00:04:15.450> that

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
a greater opportunity to win that

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:16.940 
a greater opportunity to win that
collision<00:04:15.840> area<00:04:16.200> because<00:04:16.530> that's<00:04:16.680> what<00:04:16.799> we're

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
collision area because that's what we're

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.319 
collision area because that's what we're
really<00:04:17.040> trying<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.400> do<00:04:17.549> we've<00:04:17.940> worked<00:04:18.150> on

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
really trying to do we've worked on

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.969 
really trying to do we've worked on

we got to work that off yeah
so<00:06:25.130> when<00:06:25.280> we're<00:06:25.400> doing<00:06:25.520> this<00:06:25.700> for

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
so when we're doing this for

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.220 
so when we're doing this for
presentation<00:06:26.570> we're<00:06:26.690> talking<00:06:26.960> about<00:06:27.050> the

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
presentation we're talking about the

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.500 
presentation we're talking about the
jackknife<00:06:27.650> want<00:06:28.520> to<00:06:28.610> go<00:06:28.730> through<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.330> reasons

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
jackknife want to go through the reasons

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.000 
jackknife want to go through the reasons
while<00:06:29.840> we're<00:06:29.990> doing<00:06:30.080> it<00:06:30.260> and<00:06:30.650> a<00:06:30.800> little

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
while we're doing it and a little

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.530 
while we're doing it and a little
activity<00:06:31.250> where<00:06:31.580> we<00:06:31.610> can<00:06:31.820> get<00:06:31.940> better<00:06:32.090> up

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
activity where we can get better up

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.659 
activity where we can get better up
so<00:06:33.260> if<00:06:33.440> actually<00:06:33.710> just<00:06:33.919> presentable<00:06:34.310> how<00:06:34.610> you

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
so if actually just presentable how you

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.060 
so if actually just presentable how you
normally<00:06:34.880> would<00:06:35.180> so<00:06:36.080> arms<00:06:36.410> up<00:06:36.590> we<00:06:36.830> would

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
normally would so arms up we would

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.010 
normally would so arms up we would
classify<00:06:37.220> that<00:06:37.550> as<00:06:37.700> reasonably<00:06:38.300> good<00:06:38.510> just

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
classify that as reasonably good just

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.340 
classify that as reasonably good just
show<00:06:39.139> us<00:06:39.260> the<00:06:39.380> jackknife<00:06:41.410> okay<00:06:42.850> all<00:06:43.850> right<00:06:44.090> now

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
show us the jackknife okay all right now

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.810 
show us the jackknife okay all right now
see<00:06:45.350> the<00:06:45.470> ball<00:06:45.650> is<00:06:45.919> presented<00:06:46.400> further<00:06:46.610> back

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
see the ball is presented further back

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820 
see the ball is presented further back
so<00:06:47.570> what's<00:06:47.720> the<00:06:47.840> value<00:06:47.990> of<00:06:48.200> that<00:06:48.320> jackknife

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
so what's the value of that jackknife

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.659 
so what's the value of that jackknife
position<00:06:49.280> there

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
position there

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.900 
position there
narrow<00:06:50.660> the<00:06:50.750> gate<00:06:51.020> yep<00:06:51.590> great<00:06:51.950> go<00:06:52.550> back<00:06:52.760> to

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
gate there very much a whole length of a

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.190 
gate there very much a whole length of a
body<00:06:58.160> yeah<00:06:58.460> so<00:06:59.120> as<00:06:59.389> a<00:06:59.419> defender<00:06:59.930> if<00:06:59.990> you're

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
your jackknife position now as a

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.050 
your jackknife position now as a
defender<00:07:06.080> what<00:07:06.200> you<00:07:06.320> need<00:07:06.470> to<00:07:06.590> do<00:07:07.000> makes<00:07:08.000> me

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410 
ball yep so that's the value of our jack

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.940 
ball yep so that's the value of our jack
not<00:07:12.560> just<00:07:13.280> ever<00:07:13.430> go<00:07:13.580> quick

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
not just ever go quick

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.560 
not just ever go quick
good<00:07:15.950> all<00:07:16.760> right<00:07:16.820> that's<00:07:17.120> what<00:07:17.270> we're<00:07:17.360> looking

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
good all right that's what we're looking

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:25.840 
good all right that's what we're looking
for<00:07:22.630> get<00:07:23.630> effective<00:07:24.050> in<00:07:24.260> effect<00:07:24.610> that's<00:07:25.610> it

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
for get effective in effect that's it

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:33.640 
for get effective in effect that's it
let's<00:07:26.330> go<00:07:29.350> yeah<00:07:30.370> I<00:07:31.370> think<00:07:32.320> from<00:07:33.320> a<00:07:33.350> safety

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
let's go yeah I think from a safety

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.550 
let's go yeah I think from a safety
perspective<00:07:33.950> the<00:07:34.580> game<00:07:34.760> is<00:07:35.110> it's<00:07:36.110> a<00:07:36.200> contact

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 
perspective the game is it's a contact

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.370 
perspective the game is it's a contact
sport<00:07:36.680> a<00:07:37.640> major<00:07:38.150> part<00:07:38.510> of<00:07:38.600> our<00:07:38.720> game<00:07:38.990> is<00:07:39.020> that

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:39.380 
sport a major part of our game is that

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.409 
sport a major part of our game is that
advantage<00:07:39.800> line<00:07:40.039> so<00:07:40.880> from<00:07:41.090> a<00:07:41.210> safety

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:41.419 
advantage line so from a safety

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.760 
advantage line so from a safety
perspective<00:07:41.720> it's<00:07:42.289> about<00:07:42.560> preparing

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:42.770 
perspective it's about preparing

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.630 
perspective it's about preparing
yourself<00:07:43.430> as<00:07:43.610> best<00:07:43.820> you<00:07:43.970> can<00:07:44.210> to<00:07:44.870> meet<00:07:45.020> the

opportunity to present themselves around
there<00:07:47.870> that'll<00:07:48.169> be<00:07:48.260> contact<00:07:48.710> avoiding
