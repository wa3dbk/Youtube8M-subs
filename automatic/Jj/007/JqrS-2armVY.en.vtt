00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360

 although it is very old but people 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.680
 realizes that it is clearly in the tone of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 Higher fado sounds starting here at 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:14.030
 fact 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:14.030
 The note makes me look at a sunny Sunday . 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.340
 repeating the six rings here on Sunday 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340
 already got 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 I'll do it twice in two rings 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.039
 now is not who will replace the one used in 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.799
 fifth finger you can here would be cool 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.780

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.780
 let 's see the room every month 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.340
 here you can use the room that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:59.619
 it will be a knot 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:12.110
 hello actually the third step already caught sorry 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:13.370
 football just like leaving here at home 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 on the original recording and secure a 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.170
 also the fact that it would 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.239
 he held it here 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.720
 the chord formed by the sibemol sun is the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.720
 whale take a follower kiss 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:47.620
 that other one wakes up we'll handle it 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:53.350
 with this then changes 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.350
 there we take it as fact one at a time 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.850
 three times and continues the same with a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:12.440
 rope and a finish in pity as changed 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:18.440
 much from there to this end can 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:22.870
 be changed may be you can do 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.870
 a phrase, let's use it 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:35.980
 O emfa would get the most 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.319
 modern and more does not shy away from 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.989
 original was cool 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.530
 the little barber already knows which way 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.659
 will leave 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.859
 here you can house those that 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.859
 school work that we already have 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.260
 working on several videos including 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.079
 It's very clear there on the DVD and we're 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.349
 selling Brazil all right here in this 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.819
 same channel there in our email with this 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:09.250
 down is very interesting you do 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:09.819
 about the beginning of the major school here in 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.799
 fact 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.479
 tonic or seek greater than does not 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:24.840
 it would be conventional sunshine there but flat and 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:24.840
 falling on do with rhythm and placement 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.750
 It will start for was in the third ring already 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.750
 We have to start the bass here. 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.900
 Last time I finished, I'm going to go in. 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.900
 in the rhythm 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.750
 I can repeat 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:08.389
 Now look what I've played here in the 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.849
 end of the work is normal 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.419
 if you are going to make a larger number but it is 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.419
 same scheme 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.870
 the only thing the grades will change 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.220
 said 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:28.490
 so I did not get flat and back 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:30.470
 There, just moo now I got the 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:42.849
 new year 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:42.849
 if there's only moll emy mall 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.010
 analyzing is memory and then that 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:06:00.040
 I'll take you there and give it to me. 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:06:02.700
 the party like a place I will not play 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:09.270
 final more cute little original 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.270
 in this line that yes water memory in or 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:20.110
 up to 15 mall itself but several 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.210
 endings that you can use at ease here 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.100
 in the end but I think it's cool to pass too 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.020
 a detail of the phone in this part here 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.820
 want to do a strong level of doing this 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.650
 here o 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:46.210
 you already working apart from the forum to 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:48.660
 SEFAZ movement and avianca 2 million 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.660
 dollars 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.930
 this end is also widely used instead 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.370
 to stay is what I 'm going to climb on the scale 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.470
 from im 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:13.160
 using hit came back using until 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:17.210
 in the city of London E flat and then that 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.970
 end of before not how to stay 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:32.060
 so using that phrase another phrase here 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:34.580
 so there the middle I can do is go out 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:38.389
 but the music video in the music table 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:41.450
 Gaucho, always preserving the culture and 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:44.260
 tradition of the South and some more 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.260
 rhythms of our Brazil
