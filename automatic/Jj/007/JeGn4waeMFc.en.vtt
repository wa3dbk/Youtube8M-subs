know in the comment section below if you
got<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.910> essentially<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.599> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
got it right but essentially what this

ghost Turnham

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.810 
ghost Turnham
selves<00:02:13.560> invisible<00:02:14.130> now<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.550> turn<00:02:14.700> your

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
selves invisible now you can turn your

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.190 
selves invisible now you can turn your
character<00:02:15.000> invisible<00:02:15.540> doing<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> series<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
character invisible doing a series of

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.230 
character invisible doing a series of
glitches<00:02:16.530> unfortunately<00:02:17.460> right<00:02:17.700> now<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
glitches unfortunately right now I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
glitches unfortunately right now I
couldn't<00:02:18.750> find<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.140> glitch<00:02:19.380> which<00:02:19.620> turns<00:02:19.860> your

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
couldn't find a glitch which turns your

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.340 
couldn't find a glitch which turns your
an<00:02:20.220> entire<00:02:20.730> character<00:02:21.150> invisible<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.200> you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
an entire character invisible but you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.840 
an entire character invisible but you
can<00:02:22.500> search<00:02:22.710> them<00:02:22.920> up<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.100> YouTube<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.520> see

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
can search them up on YouTube and see

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.460 
can search them up on YouTube and see
that<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.150> genuinely<00:02:24.870> glitches<00:02:25.320> of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that there are genuinely glitches of

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
that there are genuinely glitches of
characters<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.400> turned<00:02:26.670> invisible<00:02:26.850> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
characters to be turned invisible I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.460 
characters to be turned invisible I
believe<00:02:27.300> right<00:02:27.840> now<00:02:27.870> there's<00:02:28.200> most<00:02:28.410> likely

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
believe right now there's most likely

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.410 
believe right now there's most likely
mods<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.460> with<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.700> well<00:02:29.850> but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
mods you can do it with as well but

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.180 
mods you can do it with as well but
essentially<00:02:30.900> when<00:02:31.350> there<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> glitch<00:02:31.950> to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
essentially when there was a glitch to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.040 
essentially when there was a glitch to
turn<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> character<00:02:32.790> invisible<00:02:33.270> what<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.900> guy

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
turn a character invisible what this guy

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.510 
turn a character invisible what this guy
did<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.680> his<00:02:34.770> friend<00:02:35.040> turn<00:02:35.280> invisible

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
did was have his friend turn invisible

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.550 
did was have his friend turn invisible
and<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.390> stand<00:02:36.780> at<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.170> end<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and then stand at the end of the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.380 
and then stand at the end of the
mineshaft<00:02:37.800> door<00:02:38.310> where<00:02:38.820> he<00:02:38.940> throws<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
mineshaft door where he throws the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.630 
mineshaft door where he throws the
Molotov<00:02:39.810> now<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.770> person<00:02:41.130> you're<00:02:41.250> watching

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
Molotov now the person you're watching

on<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.140> player<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.620> well<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.040> essentially

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
on to the player as well so essentially

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.040 
on to the player as well so essentially
this<00:02:59.490> guy<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.940> just<00:03:00.330> completely<00:03:00.750> invisible

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
this guy is just completely invisible

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.320 
this guy is just completely invisible
using<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.590> glitch<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.070> he<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.640> off<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.880> other

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
using a glitch and he is off the other

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.300 
using a glitch and he is off the other
person's<00:03:03.420> radar<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.350> he<00:03:04.650> set<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> settings

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
person's radar as he set the settings

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.430 
person's radar as he set the settings
off<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:05.820> when<00:03:05.970> he<00:03:06.060> throws<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.600> Molotov<00:03:06.990> onto

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
off so when he throws the Molotov onto

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.410 
off so when he throws the Molotov onto
the<00:03:07.560> guy<00:03:07.680> who's<00:03:07.890> invisible<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.970> moment

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the guy who's invisible and the moment

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.270 
the guy who's invisible and the moment
the<00:03:09.540> guys<00:03:09.720> set<00:03:10.050> on<00:03:10.200> fire<00:03:10.440> he<00:03:10.710> runs<00:03:11.010> away<00:03:11.190> from

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the guys set on fire he runs away from

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.680 
the guys set on fire he runs away from
the<00:03:11.550> door<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.940> looks<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.330> fire<00:03:12.540> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the door so it looks like the fire is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.810 
the door so it looks like the fire is
coming<00:03:12.840> from<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.350> door<00:03:13.530> as<00:03:13.770> he<00:03:13.950> runs<00:03:14.190> towards

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
coming from the door as he runs towards

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820 
coming from the door as he runs towards
the<00:03:14.970> fire<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.930> course<00:03:15.960> he<00:03:16.410> runs<00:03:16.680> down

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
the fire and then of course he runs down

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.380 
the fire and then of course he runs down
the<00:03:17.010> mineshaft<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> fire<00:03:18.150> only

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
the mineshaft and the fire only

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.300 
the mineshaft and the fire only
disappears<00:03:19.050> when<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.500> fire<00:03:19.709> would<00:03:19.950> genuinely

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
disappears when the fire would genuinely

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.400 
disappears when the fire would genuinely
disappear<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.720> any<00:03:22.020> type<00:03:22.380> of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
disappear if it's on any type of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.590 
disappear if it's on any type of
character<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.250> Grand<00:03:23.550> Theft<00:03:23.610> Auto<00:03:23.850> 5<00:03:24.330> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
character in Grand Theft Auto 5 and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.330 
character in Grand Theft Auto 5 and
because<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> fire<00:03:25.500> didn't<00:03:25.800> kill<00:03:25.950> him<00:03:26.100> because

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
because the fire didn't kill him because

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.250 
because the fire didn't kill him because
he<00:03:26.700> also<00:03:26.820> had<00:03:27.120> his<00:03:27.209> displayed<00:03:27.600> turned<00:03:27.900> off<00:03:28.050> on

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
he also had his displayed turned off on

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
he also had his displayed turned off on
radar<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.190> blips<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:30.150> couldn't<00:03:30.450> see<00:03:30.540> any

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
radar and blips you couldn't see any

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.910 
radar and blips you couldn't see any
damage<00:03:31.020> done<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.410> dude<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.770> couldn't

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
damage done to this dude you couldn't

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.230 
damage done to this dude you couldn't
see<00:03:32.100> him<00:03:32.190> at<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.310> end<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:32.610> gun<00:03:32.850> even<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.180> he

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
see him at the end of you gun even if he

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.300 
see him at the end of you gun even if he
looked<00:03:33.480> at<00:03:33.570> him<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.230> couldn't<00:03:34.620> see<00:03:35.130> him

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
looked at him and you couldn't see him

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.770 
looked at him and you couldn't see him
die<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.610> he<00:03:35.760> didn't<00:03:36.000> die<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.390> essentially

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
die because he didn't die so essentially

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.720 
die because he didn't die so essentially
this<00:03:36.870> guy<00:03:37.080> was<00:03:37.320> completely<00:03:37.470> invisible<00:03:38.040> he<00:03:38.550> was

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
this guy was completely invisible he was

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.520 
this guy was completely invisible he was
on<00:03:38.850> fire<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.330> he<00:03:39.720> was<00:03:39.750> mimicking<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
on fire and he was mimicking a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.220 
on fire and he was mimicking a
ghost-like<00:03:41.310> figure<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.120> Grand<00:03:42.540> Theft<00:03:42.690> Auto<00:03:42.840> 5

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
ghost-like figure in Grand Theft Auto 5

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.750 
ghost-like figure in Grand Theft Auto 5
so<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.620> essentially<00:03:43.980> how<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> mystery

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
so that is essentially how the mystery

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.430 
so that is essentially how the mystery
was<00:03:44.910> done<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.300> know<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.750> guys<00:03:46.020> are<00:03:46.200> probably

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
was done I know you guys are probably

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.500 
was done I know you guys are probably
thinking<00:03:46.680> why<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.459> mystery<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:47.940> super<00:03:48.330> old

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
thinking why this mystery is super old

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.690 
thinking why this mystery is super old
but<00:03:48.690> no<00:03:49.170> one<00:03:49.380> kind<00:03:49.770> of<00:03:49.890> cracked<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.370> no<00:03:50.550> one

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
but no one kind of cracked it no one

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.310 
but no one kind of cracked it no one
went<00:03:51.030> down<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.690> told<00:03:51.900> everyone<00:03:52.110> how

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
went down on this and told everyone how

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.850 
went down on this and told everyone how
it<00:03:52.440> worked

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
it worked

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.410 
it worked
everyone<00:03:53.100> kind<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.250> assumed<00:03:53.670> there<00:03:54.239> was<00:03:54.360> a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
everyone kind of assumed there was a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.060 
everyone kind of assumed there was a
ghost<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.020> mineshaft<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.680> those<00:03:55.800> few

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
ghost in the mineshaft and those few

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.680 
ghost in the mineshaft and those few
people<00:03:56.190> who<00:03:56.489> understood<00:03:56.970> how<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.239> worked<00:03:57.510> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
people who understood how it worked you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.110 
people who understood how it worked you
guys<00:03:57.870> are<00:03:58.140> clever<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:59.010> guys<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.280> worked

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
guys are clever and you guys just worked

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000 
guys are clever and you guys just worked
it<00:04:00.270> out<00:04:00.360> before<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.230> many<00:04:01.380> people<00:04:01.650> did<00:04:01.860> but

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
it out before so many people did but

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.680 
it out before so many people did but
essentially<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.970> how<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.209> guy<00:04:03.450> did<00:04:03.660> it

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
essentially that is how the guy did it

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.300 
essentially that is how the guy did it
and<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> full<00:04:04.560> tutorial<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:05.190> this

use this tutorial the moment and a

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.430 
use this tutorial the moment and a
visibility<00:04:09.090> glitch<00:04:09.480> comes<00:04:09.780> out<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.170> prank

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
visibility glitch comes out to prank

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.110 
visibility glitch comes out to prank
your<00:04:10.620> friends<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:11.070> well<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.430> they<00:04:11.820> might<00:04:12.000> not

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
your friends as well as they might not

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.220 
your friends as well as they might not
know<00:04:12.239> any<00:04:12.420> different<00:04:12.750> for<00:04:12.840> as<00:04:12.930> long<00:04:13.020> as<00:04:13.080> you

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
know any different for as long as you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.840 
know any different for as long as you
tell<00:04:13.440> them<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.800> switch<00:04:14.040> their<00:04:14.250> displays<00:04:14.640> off

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
tell them to switch their displays off

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.550 
tell them to switch their displays off
so<00:04:15.030> they<00:04:15.120> can't<00:04:15.360> actually<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.230> on<00:04:16.380> their

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so they can't actually see you on their

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.159 
so they can't actually see you on their
radar<00:04:16.770> or<00:04:17.130> at<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> end<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:17.820> your<00:04:18.000> gun<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:18.930> I'm

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
