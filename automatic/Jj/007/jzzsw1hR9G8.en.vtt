one<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> major<00:00:07.770> themes<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.460> photography

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
one of the major themes in photography

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
one of the major themes in photography
is<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.570> desire<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.380> more<00:00:10.650> permanent

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
is this desire to have a more permanent

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.030 
is this desire to have a more permanent
image<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.960> Woodbury<00:00:13.290> type<00:00:13.679> you

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
image you have the Woodbury type you

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
image you have the Woodbury type you
have<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.340> Platinum<00:00:14.610> print<00:00:15.059> very<00:00:15.839> stable<00:00:16.199> very

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
have the Platinum print very stable very

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.849 
have the Platinum print very stable very
long-lasting<00:00:18.060> processes<00:00:18.990> then<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.680> also

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
long-lasting processes then you also

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.370 
long-lasting processes then you also
have<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> pigment<00:00:20.850> family<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.390> processes<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
have the pigment family of processes the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
have the pigment family of processes the
gum<00:00:22.619> bichromate<00:00:22.830> process<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> carbon

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the gun print is based on the light

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.040 
the gun print is based on the light

sensitivity of chromium Mangal Ponton is

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.660 
sensitivity of chromium Mangal Ponton is
the<00:00:54.230> first<00:00:54.470> person<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:54.950> really<00:00:55.190> do

experiments with chromium salts he
discovers<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.260> if<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:03.559> mix<00:01:03.770> them<00:01:03.980> with

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
discovers that if you mix them with

discovers that if you mix them with
colloids<00:01:04.550> gelatin<00:01:05.510> or<00:01:05.750> or<00:01:06.290> gum<00:01:06.650> they<00:01:07.220> harden

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
colloids gelatin or or gum they harden

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.930 
colloids gelatin or or gum they harden
when<00:01:08.270> they're<00:01:08.510> exposed<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.470> sunlight<00:01:10.040> based

on<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.240> work<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.540> tall<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.050> does<00:01:12.170> take<00:01:12.470> too

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
on the work of tall but it does take too

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.590 
on the work of tall but it does take too
much<00:01:12.890> time<00:01:13.160> for<00:01:13.460> people<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.759> figure<00:01:14.119> out<00:01:14.330> that

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
much time for people to figure out that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.160 
much time for people to figure out that
if<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:15.530> take<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.830> colloid<00:01:16.340> like<00:01:16.700> gum<00:01:17.600> arabic<00:01:17.840> and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
if we take a colloid like gum arabic and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.520 
if we take a colloid like gum arabic and
we<00:01:18.590> put<00:01:18.860> pigment<00:01:19.430> into<00:01:19.610> those<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.350> then<00:01:21.350> we

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
we put pigment into those and then we

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.850 
we put pigment into those and then we
sensitize<00:01:22.040> those<00:01:22.640> with<00:01:23.000> chromium<00:01:23.869> salts<00:01:24.140> we

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
sensitize those with chromium salts we

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.969 
sensitize those with chromium salts we
now<00:01:25.160> have<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.970> medium<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.619> be<00:01:27.770> brushed

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
now have a medium that can be brushed

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.960 
now have a medium that can be brushed
onto<00:01:28.280> paper<00:01:29.740> exposed<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.009> light<00:01:31.190> under<00:01:31.940> a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
negative when we put this piece of paper

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.990 
negative when we put this piece of paper
in<00:01:35.750> warm<00:01:36.290> water<00:01:36.619> areas<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.550> are<00:01:37.700> struck<00:01:37.970> by

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
in warm water areas that are struck by

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.999 
in warm water areas that are struck by
light<00:01:38.390> will<00:01:38.690> harden<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:39.649> where<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
light will harden and that's where the

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.370 
light will harden and that's where the
dark<00:01:40.250> pigment<00:01:40.700> will<00:01:40.850> be<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.270> areas<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.110> are

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
dark pigment will be and areas that are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.100 
dark pigment will be and areas that are
not<00:01:42.590> struck<00:01:43.009> by<00:01:43.190> light<00:01:43.430> will<00:01:44.060> dissolve<00:01:44.660> away

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
not struck by light will dissolve away

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.649 
not struck by light will dissolve away
leaving<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.070> white<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.400> paper<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.030> so

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
leaving the white of the paper and so

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.390 
leaving the white of the paper and so
now<00:01:47.870> we<00:01:47.930> have<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> brand<00:01:48.470> new<00:01:48.530> printing<00:01:48.920> process

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
now we have a brand new printing process

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.469 
now we have a brand new printing process

was<00:05:07.440> really<00:05:07.770> about<00:05:08.070> was<00:05:08.300> where<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.630> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
was really about was where is the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.950
