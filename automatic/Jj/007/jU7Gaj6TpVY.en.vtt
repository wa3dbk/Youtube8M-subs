00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.870 

so<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.470> think<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:26.040> reached<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.520> end<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.730> it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
so I think I reached the end of it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.010 
so I think I reached the end of it
there's<00:04:27.120> more<00:04:27.389> going<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.810> other<00:04:27.870> direction

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
there's more going the other direction

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.950 

all<00:05:14.560> right<00:05:14.740> I<00:05:14.830> think<00:05:14.889> that's<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:16.030> for<00:05:16.870> the

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
all right I think that's it for the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.480 
all right I think that's it for the
direction<00:05:17.199> that<00:05:17.410> I'm<00:05:17.530> going<00:05:17.560> hold<00:05:18.129> on<00:05:18.280> we're
