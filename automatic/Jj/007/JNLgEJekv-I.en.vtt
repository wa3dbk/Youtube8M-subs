00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
along these sides and not the tree side

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.800 
along these sides and not the tree side
because<00:00:10.800> that's<00:00:11.010> we're<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> stuff<00:00:11.700> it

sewing machine and you're just going to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.990 
sewing machine and you're just going to
sew<00:01:49.420> these<00:01:50.420> sides<00:01:50.780> see<00:01:51.079> them<00:01:51.259> soon<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.700> curves

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
sew these sides see them soon the curves

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.289 
sew these sides see them soon the curves
here<00:01:53.299> just<00:01:54.049> these<00:01:54.619> two<00:01:54.890> but<00:01:55.460> don't<00:01:55.670> sell<00:01:55.970> along

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
make sure you go nice and slow so you

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.089 
make sure you go nice and slow so you
can<00:02:08.810> turn<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.739> easier<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:12.110> what<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.650> saw<00:02:12.920> this

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
can turn it easier to what you saw this

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.570 
can turn it easier to what you saw this
on<00:02:13.340> what<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:13.970> should<00:02:14.090> look<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:16.280> then<00:02:16.340> you

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
on what it should look like and then you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820 
on what it should look like and then you
can<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.880> flip<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.269> inside<00:02:17.750> out<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:18.560> right

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
can just flip this inside out or right

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.530 
can just flip this inside out or right
side<00:02:19.069> out<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:22.310> poke<00:02:22.580> make<00:02:23.209> sure<00:02:23.239> all<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
side out and just poke make sure all the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.300 
side out and just poke make sure all the
same<00:02:23.900> chillin<00:02:24.319> flat<00:02:24.650> such

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310

so now you're going to start piecing

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.880 
so now you're going to start piecing
everything<00:02:29.540> together<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.530> can<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.860> a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
everything together so you can get a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.400 
everything together so you can get a
little<00:02:31.489> bit<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.640> stuffing<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.360> only<00:02:33.140> use<00:02:33.290> about

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
to do that for both of them just make

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.840 
to do that for both of them just make
sure<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:42.890> thing<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.160> lot<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.520> stuffing

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
sure it's this thing a lot of stuffing

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.070 
sure it's this thing a lot of stuffing
and<00:02:44.209> each<00:02:44.470> thin<00:02:45.580> sure<00:02:46.580> they<00:02:46.730> feel<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.360> same<00:02:47.600> so

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
and each thin sure they feel the same so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.360 
and each thin sure they feel the same so
what<00:02:48.230> you're<00:02:48.350> going<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.500> do<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.890> place<00:02:49.340> your

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
what you're going to do is place your

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.259 
what you're going to do is place your
mamegoma<00:02:50.239> body<00:02:50.600> right<00:02:51.470> side<00:02:51.830> up<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.400> that

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
mamegoma body right side up and that

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.580 
mamegoma body right side up and that
means<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.630> stitching<00:02:54.050> should<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.410> facing

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
means the stitching should be facing

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.790 
means the stitching should be facing
down<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:56.510> you're<00:02:56.690> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.989> get<00:02:57.290> your<00:02:57.500> belly

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
piece and flip it in half and find the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.620 
piece and flip it in half and find the
center<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.550> line<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.690> with<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
center and line that up with the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.030 
center and line that up with the
center<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.370> face<00:03:07.000> piece<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:08.830> pin<00:03:09.010> it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
center of the face piece and just pin it

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.070 
center of the face piece and just pin it
there<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.460> then<00:03:09.520> do<00:03:10.390> two<00:03:11.170> or<00:03:11.350> three<00:03:12.720> pins<00:03:13.720> on

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
there and then do two or three pins on

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.470 
there and then do two or three pins on
each<00:03:14.320> side<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.860> pin<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.330> want<00:03:16.450> to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
each side of that pin you just want to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.940 
each side of that pin you just want to
make<00:03:16.600> sure<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.840> your<00:03:17.110> pins<00:03:17.350> are<00:03:17.560> evenly

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
make sure that your pins are evenly

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.120 
make sure that your pins are evenly
spaced<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.000> they<00:03:19.150> end<00:03:19.510> up<00:03:20.110> even<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:20.950> both

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
spaced so that they end up even on both

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.160 
spaced so that they end up even on both
sides<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:22.000> where<00:03:22.300> they<00:03:22.450> hit<00:03:22.960> at<00:03:23.140> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
sides like this where they hit at the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.850 
sides like this where they hit at the
same<00:03:23.260> point<00:03:23.710> then<00:03:24.580> you're<00:03:24.730> going<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.090> get<00:03:25.210> your

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
same point then you're going to get your

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.550 
same point then you're going to get your
thin<00:03:26.860> pieces<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:29.050> part<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.320> kind<00:03:29.500> of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
thin pieces and this part is kind of

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.990 
thin pieces and this part is kind of
hard<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.740> explain<00:03:29.830> but<00:03:30.340> hopefully<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.910> guys

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
hard to explain but hopefully you guys

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.880 
hard to explain but hopefully you guys
can<00:03:31.060> see<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.570> just<00:03:31.720> push<00:03:31.930> all<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.320> stuff<00:03:32.590> into

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
can see I just push all the stuff into

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.330 
can see I just push all the stuff into
the<00:03:32.950> back<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.810> squish<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.050> like<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.680> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340

the back and squish this like that and
put<00:03:36.520> a<00:03:36.550> skinnier<00:03:37.000> end<00:03:37.210> at<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.790> top<00:03:39.790> where<00:03:40.360> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
put a skinnier end at the top where the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.020 
put a skinnier end at the top where the
pin<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:42.250> light<00:03:42.550> this<00:03:42.730> piece<00:03:43.000> down

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
pin is and then light this piece down

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.080 
pin is and then light this piece down
she<00:03:43.840> should<00:03:44.110> get<00:03:44.230> like<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.410> sandwich<00:03:45.090> for

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
she should get like a sandwich for

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.150 
she should get like a sandwich for
fabrics<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:48.490> go<00:03:48.640> ahead<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:48.940> pin<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.240> down

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
fabrics and go ahead and pin that down

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.970 
fabrics and go ahead and pin that down
like<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:53.200> make<00:03:53.350> sure<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.800> they're

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
like that just make sure that they're

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.800 
like that just make sure that they're
all<00:03:54.220> lined<00:03:54.820> up<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.210> then<00:03:55.270> you're<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.630> do

the same for the other side so then

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.590 
the same for the other side so then
you're<00:03:59.380> just<00:03:59.410> going<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.710> finish<00:03:59.890> pinning<00:04:00.250> all

and there's going to be a little bit of

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.340 
and there's going to be a little bit of
fabric<00:04:05.820> left<00:04:06.180> over<00:04:06.450> but<00:04:06.600> that's<00:04:06.810> fine<00:04:07.050> don't
