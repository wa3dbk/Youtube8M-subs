00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 in a daytona beach house in florida 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 in the USA a man met with a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.030
 small gift in your garden apparently 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.520
 a black bear had managed to get into 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.990
 his plot and he was lying in his hammock 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 enjoying the tranquility of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.779
 pleasure and the comfort that lies in lying down 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
 in a good hammock for surprising that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.460
 look like the bears are also 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.989
 intelligent and without anyone teaching 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 This bear what he served hammock 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 deciphered so that it was used he lay down on 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 she and she was lying for 20 minutes 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.670
 in the hammock clear as you can 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.219
 imagine the owner of that house and that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 plot then stayed completely 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 hallucinated not because he had just entered a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.610
 bear in his garden and he had lain 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.900
 the place where he lay down all the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.000
 afternoons 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.310
 it's certainly a strange situation that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.790
 demonstrates the intelligence that the 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.590
 bears as you can see in this case the bear 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.630
 I was looking for your comfort 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.060
 you have pictures in which you can 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 appreciate perfectly the bear enjoy 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 from your little nap 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.369
 the owner of the residence is called 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 vincent james and said the animal was 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.380
 he slept as if it were some kind of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.240
 tourist at first something scared him but 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.290
 then he went back to the place again 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.660
 keep lying in the hammock 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.990
 was for about 20 minutes in the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.090
 Hammock before returning to the forest 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.700
 reports indicate that the animal had 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 been seen checking the garbage cans 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.430
 from the area days before the local photographer 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.380
 Rafael Torre followed the bear and managed 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.100
 photograph him when he was 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.530
 about 20 meters away 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.049
 say as a curiosity that after the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.299
 incident the owner removed the hammock 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.640
 because I knew that if I left the hammock 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.640
 there the bear would come back every day 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.040
 to take a nap without a doubt 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.290
 really curious news that as I have already 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.159
 said shows the enormous intelligence 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.159
 of bears
