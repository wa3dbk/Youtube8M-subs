newsletter there's a link below and in

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.190 
newsletter there's a link below and in
the<00:03:47.569> end<00:03:48.469> of<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.680> video<00:03:48.889> but<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.669> think<00:03:49.760> the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
the end of the video but so I think the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.300 
the end of the video but so I think the
tomato<00:03:51.200> should<00:03:51.409> be<00:03:51.530> thicker<00:03:51.769> like<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.099> half

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
tomato should be thicker like a half

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:01.699 
tomato should be thicker like a half
inch<00:03:52.489> thick<00:03:55.209> hmm

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.510 

the<00:04:02.709> cream<00:04:03.010> sauce<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.400> pretty<00:04:03.720> pretty<00:04:04.720> creamy

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
the cream sauce is pretty pretty creamy

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.430 
the cream sauce is pretty pretty creamy
but<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.640> tomato<00:04:06.940> really<00:04:07.840> cuts<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.230> and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
but the tomato really cuts that and

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.690 
but the tomato really cuts that and
changes<00:04:08.770> it<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.040> really<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.400> there's

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
changes it so I really like that there's

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.650 
changes it so I really like that there's
really<00:04:09.819> quite<00:04:10.030> fun<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.209> thought<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.510> heavy

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
really quite fun I thought the heavy

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.580 
really quite fun I thought the heavy
cream<00:04:10.870> would<00:04:10.989> be<00:04:11.050> too<00:04:11.230> much

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
cream would be too much

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.520 
cream would be too much
maybe<00:04:12.520> we'll<00:04:12.760> dial<00:04:12.940> us<00:04:13.150> back<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.569> make<00:04:14.500> it

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
maybe we'll dial us back and make it

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.000 
maybe we'll dial us back and make it
with<00:04:14.680> milk<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.160> see<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.620> took<00:04:17.829> like

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
with milk and see but this took like

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.379 
with milk and see but this took like
what<00:04:18.190> all<00:04:18.340> three<00:04:18.579> minutes<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.209> tastes

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
what all three minutes and it tastes

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.320
