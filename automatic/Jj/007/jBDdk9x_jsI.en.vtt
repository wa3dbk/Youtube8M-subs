comfortable<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.380> reason<00:00:31.800> being<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.189> got<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
comfortable the reason being it's got a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
comfortable the reason being it's got a
lot<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.669> technology<00:00:33.300> behind<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.860> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
lot of technology behind it so first of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.549 
lot of technology behind it so first of
all<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.579> has<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.210> your<00:00:36.780> new<00:00:36.899> calls<00:00:37.170> Magna

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
all this has what your new calls Magna

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.680 
all this has what your new calls Magna
traction<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.280> you've<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.390> wavy

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
traction so you've got this wavy

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
traction so you've got this wavy
sidewall<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> does<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
sidewall here and what it does is it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
sidewall here and what it does is it
gives<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.660> acts<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.170> serrated<00:00:43.530> knife

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
gives you it acts like a serrated knife

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
gives you it acts like a serrated knife
but<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> gives<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.460> multiple<00:00:44.850> contact<00:00:45.360> points

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
but it gives you multiple contact points

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
but it gives you multiple contact points
with<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.440> snow<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.850> take<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> little

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
with the snow so you can take a little

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 
with the snow so you can take a little
bit<00:00:48.570> softer<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.230> board<00:00:49.500> generally<00:00:50.210> this<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
bit softer of a board generally this is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.000 
bit softer of a board generally this is
kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> mid<00:00:51.840> flex<00:00:52.050> I'd<00:00:52.289> say<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> mid<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
kind of mid flex I'd say the mid to a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
kind of mid flex I'd say the mid to a
little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.460> stiff<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
little bit stiff and you just get that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.410 
little bit stiff and you just get that
extra<00:00:55.770> edge<00:00:56.010> hold<00:00:56.309> without<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.000> super

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
extra edge hold without just a super

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.040 
extra edge hold without just a super
super<00:00:57.780> stiff<00:00:58.020> board<00:00:59.120> you<00:01:00.120> could<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.449> detune

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
super stiff board you could also detune

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
super stiff board you could also detune
the<00:01:01.230> edges<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.710> you're<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> park<00:01:02.550> rider

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the edges if you're more of a park rider

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
the edges if you're more of a park rider
and<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.600> still<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and you're still going to be able to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
and you're still going to be able to
ride<00:01:04.710> everywhere<00:01:04.890> else<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> moon<00:01:05.850> because

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
ride everywhere else on the moon because

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
ride everywhere else on the moon because
you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.689> those<00:01:06.840> multiple<00:01:07.290> contact<00:01:07.799> points

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you have those multiple contact points

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.740 
you have those multiple contact points
no<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.590> called<00:01:10.860> c2<00:01:11.520> btx

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
no you also have this is called c2 btx

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.050 
no you also have this is called c2 btx
so<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.920> camera<00:01:14.700> directly

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
so what you have is camera directly

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.179 
so what you have is camera directly
underneath<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.960> bindings<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.860> rocker

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
underneath the bindings and then rocker

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.130 
underneath the bindings and then rocker
in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> tip<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> tails<00:01:18.210> home<00:01:18.540> Amil<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
in the tip in the tails home Amil the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980 
in the tip in the tails home Amil the
board<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> benefits<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.509> rocker

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
board so you get the benefits of rocker

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
board so you get the benefits of rocker
which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:23.159> grief<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> into

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
which is grief if you can get this into

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
which is grief if you can get this into
some<00:01:24.869> deeper<00:01:25.200> snow<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.270> sit

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
some deeper snow you really just sit

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
some deeper snow you really just sit
back<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.170> makes<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> super<00:01:29.009> easy<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.340> float

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
back on it makes it super easy to float

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.060 
back on it makes it super easy to float
on<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> camber<00:01:31.140> again<00:01:31.470> gives<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
on but the camber again gives you that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.210 
on but the camber again gives you that
edge<00:01:32.310> full

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
edge full

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.400 
edge full
takes<00:01:33.820> away<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.150> squirrely<00:01:34.870> feeling<00:01:35.260> of

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
takes away that squirrely feeling of

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.980 
takes away that squirrely feeling of
rocker<00:01:35.680> really<00:01:36.580> makes<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:37.000> just<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.330> solid<00:01:37.780> ride

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
rocker really makes it just a solid ride

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.530 
rocker really makes it just a solid ride
so<00:01:38.320> what<00:01:39.190> I<00:01:39.220> really<00:01:39.580> liked<00:01:39.760> about<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.210> board

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
so what I really liked about this board

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.210 
so what I really liked about this board
is<00:01:40.660> you<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:40.930> get<00:01:41.110> into<00:01:41.410> variable<00:01:41.920> conditions

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
is you can get into variable conditions

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.220 
is you can get into variable conditions
and<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.640> always<00:01:42.880> feel<00:01:43.300> secure<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.810> always

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
and you always feel secure you always

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.110 
and you always feel secure you always
feel<00:01:44.380> comfortable<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.250> because<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.940> know
