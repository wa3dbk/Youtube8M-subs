Oh

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.380 

got<00:01:23.020> germanium<00:01:24.020> boost<00:01:24.620> pedal<00:01:24.920> here<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:26.210> I

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
got germanium boost pedal here that I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.540 
got germanium boost pedal here that I
built<00:01:26.660> it's<00:01:27.110> kind<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.590> range<00:01:27.800> master<00:01:28.100> clone

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
built it's kind of a range master clone

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.890 
built it's kind of a range master clone
but<00:01:28.729> I'm<00:01:28.820> not<00:01:29.030> sure<00:01:29.060> how<00:01:29.300> much<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.630> actually

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
but I'm not sure how much it actually

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.649 
but I'm not sure how much it actually
sounds<00:01:30.350> like<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.500> real<00:01:30.830> rangemaster<00:01:31.580> but<00:01:32.210> if

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
sounds like a real rangemaster but if

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.969 
sounds like a real rangemaster but if
you<00:01:32.810> crank<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.260> up<00:01:33.290> it'll<00:01:33.590> add<00:01:33.800> some

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
you crank it up it'll add some

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.010 
you crank it up it'll add some
distortion<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.210> got<00:01:35.450> one

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
distortion to it just a got one

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.859 
distortion to it just a got one
transistor<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.340> I've<00:01:37.430> got<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.869> eq

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
transistor in it and I've got a eq

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.200 
transistor in it and I've got a eq
switch<00:01:39.259> here<00:01:39.590> kind<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.369> like<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> beano<00:01:40.910> boost

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
switch here kind of like the beano boost

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.050 
switch here kind of like the beano boost
mids<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.890> middle<00:01:43.130> there<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.340> trouble<00:01:43.729> and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
mids in the middle there is trouble and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.850 
mids in the middle there is trouble and
up<00:01:44.660> it's<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.960> little<00:01:45.140> bass<00:01:45.290> here<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.650> I'm<00:01:45.740> going

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
up it's a little bass here so I'm going

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.719 
up it's a little bass here so I'm going
to<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.130> trouble<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.670> sting<00:01:46.970> here<00:01:48.399> my<00:01:49.399> amps

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
to do the trouble to sting here my amps

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.790 
to do the trouble to sting here my amps
a<00:01:49.880> little<00:01:50.210> darker<00:01:50.630> when<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.470> when<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
a little darker when it when the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.490 
a little darker when it when the
distortions<00:01:52.399> turned<00:01:52.670> out<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:56.539> kick<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
distortions turned out so kick on the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:14.500 
distortions turned out so kick on the
boost

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:30.440 

oh<00:02:14.540> that's<00:02:15.500> rich<00:02:15.830> pick<00:02:16.129> up

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.000 

just<00:02:31.450> finish<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.900> guitar<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.469> today<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:32.829> I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
just finish this guitar up today so I

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.979 
just finish this guitar up today so I
haven't<00:02:33.250> had<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.430> whole<00:02:33.640> lot<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:34.000> play<00:02:34.510> time<00:02:34.540> on

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
haven't had a whole lot of play time on

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:50.590 
haven't had a whole lot of play time on
it<00:02:35.109> so<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:35.500> kind<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.400> break

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.290 

let's<00:02:51.380> neck<00:02:51.680> pickup
