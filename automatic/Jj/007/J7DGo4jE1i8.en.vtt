 I studied medicine and sport and 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.060
 then only a few years in the place 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.380
 have worked a lot in orthopedics 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.480
 I am very much scientific

 committed and much researched in the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.620
 area of ​​the molecular city ​​in the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.780
 We have a lot of orthopedics 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 worked body's own active ingredients 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 that 's why I know that from the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.050
 orthopedic then transferred to the skin 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.110
 wants skin cells and cartilage cells 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.350
 similar to a typical young work 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.910
 face is bouncing has a heart shape the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.460
 eyebrows are nice to the top 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.100
 punished the contours are very sharp 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.510
 limited and tightened the mouth angle 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.090
 show upwards 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.340
 The cheekbones are stressed and it is 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.160
 just a very positive one 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.170
 facial expression when the heart shape a 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.590
 Represents youthful face 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.780
 a so-called Disney face is one 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.849
 own face the heart shape down 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.569
 The hamster cheeks are turned upside down 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:22.179
 the wrinkle of wrinkles on the sleeps arises 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.560
 volume loss the trainer arises 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.989
 everything says a little bit down 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.550
 and the heart is basically upset 

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:29.590
 you have to do that during the treatment 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.149
 consider and fix what is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.479
 bad for the skin a bad one 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.450
 lifestyle for example smoking alcohol 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.539
 poor nutrition too little water 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.599
 too much sun exposure too much make-up 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.550
 and that's very important 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.190
 if you use the wrong care 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.429
 Wrong care can make the skin quite strong 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.789
 worsen so big pores too much 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.410
 Bickel formation too much allergies 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.989
 redness these are all factors 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.989
 can cause a wrong care 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.890
 A rejuvenation of the skin from here 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.810
 with the so-called scatter that is a 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.629
 proceed what has developed 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.060
 We can use it to structure things like that again 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.569
 make sure that you are in the youthful 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.190
 concept of this heart shape fit for that 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.640
 käppele I use different 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.400
 hyaluronic acid with different strengths 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 but also alice and botulinum toxin and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.330
 I like to combine that too 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.010
 the body's own active ingredients of the scan lift 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.810
 gives us many possibilities the face 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.000
 rebuild and rejuvenate 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.920
 we can contemplate contours again 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.780
 reconstruct 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.030
 we can build up the chin part we do 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.099
 can streamline the table edge and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.660
 we can compete again 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.519
 raise eyebrows 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.340
 We can basically face the whole thing 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.360
 rejuvenate many years without the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.910
 type to change 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.160
 it is important to me that no grandiose 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.620
 So encapsulation arise or 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.079
 allergies appear with me 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.970
 safety in the first place the catalyst 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.400
 It's so fantastic because it's not only 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.109
 natural results achieved but 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.489
 The patient can also immediately his 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.019
 everyday life again 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.920
 So there are no downtime 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.920
 warp 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.520
 the microdermabrasion is a fine one 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.200
 Sand the skin where we are with this 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.390
 diamond grind the tower 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.970
 remove superficial skin cells 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.959
 only the special in the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.730
 mikrodermabrasion is in contrast to 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.500
 normal scrubs peelings that you more 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.660
 Horn layers can remove 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.940
 as just this conventional penig after 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.380
 Microdermabrasion is the skin 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.660
 especially receptive 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.739
 both with superficial skin cells 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.930
 remove 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.010
 otherwise just the whole care 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.390
 soak up 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.840
 that's what the hammer is all about now 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.739
 Relieved and the skin is really extreme 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.989
 receptive fits schoenen swarm 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.030
 for all subsequent products therefore 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.410

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.330
 pick up with the higher dollar 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.810
 For me it's not only important that 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.300
 Patients go out here in the sense of 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.850
 a construction of the face but also 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.790
 that the skin again shines beautifully 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.530
 looks small pores has the skin 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.570
 Quality plays a very big role for me 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.760
 role in my work molecules 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.490
 cosmetics is the first care series 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.650

 i have my experience in the clinic everyday and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.479
 because I have a lot of patients 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.280
 I had a lot of skin problems 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.199
 the claim of an anti aging care 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.190
 to develop at the cell level 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.190
 is working
