00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and this is just an unboxing video after

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.589 
and this is just an unboxing video after
that<00:00:28.019> i<00:00:28.230> would<00:00:28.380> definitely<00:00:28.650> make<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.980> video

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
that i would definitely make a video

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
that i would definitely make a video
showing<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.960> complete<00:00:31.500> capabilities<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> the

showing the complete capabilities of the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.049 
showing the complete capabilities of the
system<00:00:33.230> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.350> actually<00:00:34.739> how<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.860> came<00:00:35.219> in

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
system this is actually how it came in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.560 
system this is actually how it came in
an<00:00:36.270> express<00:00:36.690> mail<00:00:37.309> bag<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:39.149> soon<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.450> I

I believe they released the colonel and
the<00:01:54.860> bootloader<00:01:55.310> around<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.820> week<00:01:56.030> ago<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.930> you

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the bootloader around a week ago so you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.070 
the bootloader around a week ago so you
can<00:01:57.290> go<00:01:57.410> and<00:01:57.590> download<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.040> from<00:01:58.250> there<00:01:58.460> and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
can go and download it from there and

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.639 
can go and download it from there and
just<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.229> barcode<00:02:00.649> on<00:02:02.740> opening<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.890> box<00:02:05.649> we

just the barcode on opening the box we

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.870 
just the barcode on opening the box we
have<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.520> standard<00:02:09.670> APC<00:02:12.310> charger<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.760> is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
have a standard APC charger this is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.690 
have a standard APC charger this is
different<00:02:16.120> there<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:18.110> point<00:02:18.470> 5<00:02:19.250> ampere

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700

between<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.430> PC<00:02:26.920> product<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.700> Raspberry

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
between a PC product and the Raspberry

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.720 
between a PC product and the Raspberry
Pi<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.250> raspberry<00:02:31.670> pi

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
Pi that I have is that the raspberry pi

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.060 
Pi that I have is that the raspberry pi
is<00:02:32.530> way<00:02:33.530> smaller<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:35.030> disadvantages<00:02:36.070> it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
is way smaller and the disadvantages it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.610 
is way smaller and the disadvantages it
does<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.549> come<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:37.970> power<00:02:38.180> supply<00:02:38.620> this

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
does not come with the power supply this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.360 
does not come with the power supply this
one<00:02:39.830> does<00:02:40.239> we<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.690> power<00:02:42.019> supply<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:45.370> USB

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
one does we have a power supply a USB

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 
one does we have a power supply a USB
cable<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:46.910> guess<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.870> loading<00:02:48.230> the

the board has up starting from the left
there's<00:03:49.909> a<00:03:50.409> port<00:03:51.409> for<00:03:51.560> power<00:03:51.799> supply<00:03:52.159> a<00:03:52.480> VGA

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
there's a port for power supply a VGA

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.780 
there's a port for power supply a VGA
port<00:03:54.430> one<00:03:55.430> HDMI<00:03:56.200> for<00:03:57.200> us<00:03:57.530> be<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.950> 1<00:03:58.370> gigabit

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
port one HDMI for us be a 1 gigabit

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.190 
port one HDMI for us be a 1 gigabit
ethernet<00:03:58.849> port<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:01.099> looks<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:02.139> audio<00:04:03.139> out

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
ethernet port this looks like audio out

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.479 
ethernet port this looks like audio out

SD slot right there and believe it or
not<00:04:15.889> unlike<00:04:16.310> Raspberry<00:04:17.180> Pi<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.780> does<00:04:18.019> have<00:04:18.259> a

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
not unlike Raspberry Pi this does have a

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.980 
not unlike Raspberry Pi this does have a
power<00:04:20.419> reset<00:04:20.720> button<00:04:22.120> besides<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.389> you<00:04:23.810> can

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
power reset button besides that you can

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.219 
power reset button besides that you can
give<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:25.520> has<00:04:25.699> another<00:04:26.030> input<00:04:26.509> for<00:04:27.020> power

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
give it that has another input for power

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.370 
give it that has another input for power
supply<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:29.180> can<00:04:29.360> see<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.570> right<00:04:29.720> here<00:04:29.960> DC
