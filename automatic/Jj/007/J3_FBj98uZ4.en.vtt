00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
 part right? 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.260
 when you are ready then we are 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 passing the toast in cinnamon with sugar 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 then only these ingredients will do 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.039
 You will put this box of cream 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.590
 milk will put the two eggs 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.120
 you will put the two tablespoons of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 sugar soup and you're going to hit the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.309
 blender for about two 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.170
 little brothers quick thing only power 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.670
 to form a homogeneous cream and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 then this cream is not true of the indicator 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350
 reported that the baby cream of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 eggs sugar 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.150
 You're going to wet the tone cut into slices. 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.100
 of toast and will wet this cream 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.740
 then you're going to take this place in 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.509
 micro waves but will have to put three 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 breads and french toast because you can not use 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.890
 put very sudden microwaves or I 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 I'm going to put 3 power assaults 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.200
 Then you 'll put it in the microwave for 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 approximately one minute is just 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 one minute is not more than one minute is not going 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.930
 going out will get dry it will be hard 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.049
 so if you put it down for a minute only 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.259
 It's good to be able to stay soft 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.349
 Then you'll just take it out too hot. 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.290
 her right hand then you burn the passes in 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.900
 cinnamon with sugar 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.379
 It's just to serve so there's this recipe 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.480
 fast simple and healthy very healthy 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.849
 Yeah, I'm sure you'll like it. 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980
 it is different in this call painting is 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.170
 That boring thing you 're going to do. 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.870
 difference and will get healthier 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.420
 because people who can not eat 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.140
 frying is then an option for the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.250
 person do not run out of your toast 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.930
 traditional christmas 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.659
 so now I want to leave one here 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.090
 small portion of the word of God that 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:49.909
 found in the gospel of Matthew chapter 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.849
 22 verse 11 that says so entering 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.439
 at home find the boy with maria his mother 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:00.829
 and prostrating themselves if they worshiped him and opened 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:02.599
 their treasures and offered gifts of gold 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.769
 incense and myrrh 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.560
 so here he is talking about the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.359
 birth of lord jesus christ 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.450
 when these men went there to 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.760
 to give Maria the birth of her 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.449
 son and we also have to give 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.590
 the Lord but as thanking God 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:23.989
 by his son by the Lord Jesus Christ 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.750
 right at his birth because he died 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.829
 on the cross for us and we are here today 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.419
 celebrating life is not the victory and it is very 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.150
 good to celebrate that it is time to 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.549
 family is a moment of fraternization 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.900
 and you enjoy this moment well but the 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.340
 christmas awareness knowing that you 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.340
 Jesus for us is our greatest 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:52.449
 gift God bless you greatly 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.449
