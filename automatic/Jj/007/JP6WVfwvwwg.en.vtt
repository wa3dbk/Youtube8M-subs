gunstreak<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.990> would<00:02:28.170> count<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.680> it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
gunstreak because that would count if it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.660 
gunstreak because that would count if it
was<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> towards<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> nuclear<00:02:29.970> or<00:02:30.150> something<00:02:31.670> now

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
was a towards a nuclear or something now

twenty one and two with the executioner
now<00:03:41.760> my<00:03:42.760> opinion<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.359> bad<00:03:43.540> tool<00:03:45.689> gonna

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
now my opinion that is in bad tool gonna

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.780 
now my opinion that is in bad tool gonna
chase<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.079> guy<00:03:47.169> down<00:03:50.189> lie<00:03:51.189> down<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.549> core

chase this guy down lie down in the core

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.809 
chase this guy down lie down in the core
and<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:51.970> guess<00:03:52.180> right<00:03:53.400> I'm<00:03:54.400> really<00:03:54.639> bad<00:03:54.790> with
