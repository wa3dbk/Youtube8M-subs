this<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.950> called<00:00:08.280> time<00:00:08.700> travel<00:00:09.440> so<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
this is called time travel so this is a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.690 
this is called time travel so this is a
consequence<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:13.139> particular<00:00:14.040> wormhole

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
consequence of this particular wormhole

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.500 
consequence of this particular wormhole
that<00:00:15.509> connects<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.310> tunnel<00:00:17.940> connects

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
that connects the as a tunnel connects

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.830 
that connects the as a tunnel connects
the<00:00:18.810> black<00:00:19.560> hole<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.490> sucks<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:21.090> space

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the black hole that sucks in space

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500 
the black hole that sucks in space
I<00:00:21.869> mean<00:00:22.769> matter<00:00:23.010> hardening<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.300> white

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
I mean matter hardening and the white

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.429 
I mean matter hardening and the white
hole<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.109> emits<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:26.000> energy<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> this

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
hole that emits out energy and so this

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
hole that emits out energy and so this
little<00:00:28.650> tunnel<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.730> exists<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.810> connects

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
little tunnel that exists that connects

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.520 
little tunnel that exists that connects
these<00:00:31.529> two<00:00:31.700> universes<00:00:33.290> QBit

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.670 
has but that you all have available to
you<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.360> what<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.840> allow<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> do

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you and what this will allow you to do

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.660 
you and what this will allow you to do
then<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.270> what<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.979> what<00:01:10.979> off<00:01:11.189> planet

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
then is what I do and what off planet

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.929 
then is what I do and what off planet
does<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.580> saw<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
does and what is that what you saw in

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.390 
does and what is that what you saw in
the<00:01:15.030> first<00:01:15.240> picture<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.770> time

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the first picture and what is that time

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
the first picture and what is that time
travel<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> how<00:01:18.390> does<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> happen<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.860> go

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
travel and how does that happen you go

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.520 
travel and how does that happen you go
between<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.640> dimensions<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> do

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
between the dimensions and how do you do

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.240 
between the dimensions and how do you do
that<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.750> einstein-rosen<00:01:25.680> bridge

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that you use the einstein-rosen bridge

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
that you use the einstein-rosen bridge
and<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.659> transmute<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:31.140> very

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and you transmute so it is very very

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.840 
and you transmute so it is very very
possible<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.229> warp<00:01:35.130> bubble<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.670> we

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
possible and this is a warp bubble as we

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.980 
possible and this is a warp bubble as we
said<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.479> carries<00:01:36.869> light<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:39.180> goes<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.780> light

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
said that carries light it goes at light

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.429 
said that carries light it goes at light
speed

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
speed

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.670 
speed
it<00:01:40.710> carries<00:01:41.490> objects<00:01:41.909> rather<00:01:42.530> 186,000<00:01:43.530> miles

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it carries objects rather 186,000 miles

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.270 
it carries objects rather 186,000 miles
per<00:01:43.860> second<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.810> frequency<00:01:46.710> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
per second so your frequency we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
per second so your frequency we
mentioned<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> by<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.390> we

mentioned the by and will be we

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560 
mentioned the by and will be we
mentioned<00:01:49.430> 1,000<00:01:50.430> Hertz<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.030> keep<00:01:51.240> cycling

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

you're<00:02:36.799> talking<00:02:37.069> about<00:02:37.459> missing<00:02:38.150> time<00:02:38.450> you're

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
you're talking about missing time you're

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.440 
you're talking about missing time you're
talking<00:02:39.680> about<00:02:39.799> time<00:02:40.220> travel<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:41.000> you're

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
talking about time travel and you're

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.649 
talking about time travel and you're
talking<00:02:41.720> about<00:02:42.159> invincibility<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:44.269> when<00:02:44.480> your

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
talking about invincibility so when your

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.129 
talking about invincibility so when your
frequency<00:02:45.349> hits<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:46.069> rate<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:47.510> when<00:02:47.989> you

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
frequency hits that rate that's when you

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.500 
frequency hits that rate that's when you
become<00:02:48.560> invisible<00:02:49.010> or<00:02:49.519> everyone<00:02:50.120> solve<00:02:50.359> I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
become invisible or everyone solve I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.530 
become invisible or everyone solve I
always<00:02:50.989> wanted<00:02:51.349> an<00:02:51.440> invisibility<00:02:51.920> cloak<00:02:52.540> they

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
always wanted an invisibility cloak they

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.330 
always wanted an invisibility cloak they
already<00:02:53.870> have<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.530> there's<00:02:54.889> some<00:02:55.069> beautiful

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
already have it there's some beautiful

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.360 
already have it there's some beautiful
scientific<00:02:56.209> studies<00:02:56.659> where<00:02:57.079> they<00:02:57.230> make<00:02:57.950> pins

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
scientific studies where they make pins

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.629 
scientific studies where they make pins
and<00:02:58.879> coke<00:02:59.120> cans<00:02:59.480> appear<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:00.290> disappear<00:03:00.639> so

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
and coke cans appear and disappear so

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.479 
and coke cans appear and disappear so
you<00:03:02.450> know<00:03:02.569> they're<00:03:02.810> already<00:03:02.959> doing<00:03:03.409> it<00:03:03.950> it's

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
you know they're already doing it it's

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.460 
you know they're already doing it it's
already<00:03:04.849> happened<00:03:05.450> here<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.900> your<00:03:06.049> science

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
already happened here in your science

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.979 
already happened here in your science
labs<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.400> if<00:03:07.609> it's<00:03:07.790> happened<00:03:08.239> here<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.540> earth

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
labs so if it's happened here on earth

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.220 
labs so if it's happened here on earth
what<00:03:09.769> do<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.069> think<00:03:10.459> has<00:03:10.760> happened<00:03:10.790> out<00:03:11.780> in

what do you think has happened out in

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.670 
what do you think has happened out in
the<00:03:12.620> thirteenth<00:03:13.129> dimension<00:03:13.849> beyond<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.079> how

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the thirteenth dimension beyond so how

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.550 
the thirteenth dimension beyond so how
are<00:03:15.859> off-planet<00:03:16.400> getting<00:03:16.819> here

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
are off-planet getting here

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.960 
are off-planet getting here
materializing<00:03:18.560> dematerializing<00:03:19.549> how<00:03:19.819> are

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
materializing dematerializing how are
