00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
and obviously there's always going to be

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.200 
and obviously there's always going to be
some<00:05:09.530> doubt<00:05:09.710> because<00:05:10.040> you<00:05:10.130> can't<00:05:10.370> decide<00:05:11.000> your

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
some doubt because you can't decide your
