00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
in the cell it's working well and I can

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.870 
in the cell it's working well and I can
tell<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.529> organelles<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> way<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.289> works<00:00:28.880> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

the wrappers Ohm's I'm making all the
proteins<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> cell<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.880> function<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
proteins so the cell can function like a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.289 
proteins so the cell can function like a
pro<00:01:07.020> team<00:01:07.290> once<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> proteins<00:01:08.790> ready<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> go

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299

pack that protein nice and tight so they

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
pack that protein nice and tight so they

have you ever wondered how the cell

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.280 
have you ever wondered how the cell

powers up energy from mitochondria is

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.290 
powers up energy from mitochondria is
what's<00:01:50.590> up<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.040> nuclear<00:01:51.370> envelope<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.090> where

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
what's up the nuclear envelope is where

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.090 
what's up the nuclear envelope is where
it<00:01:52.540> all<00:01:52.690> starts<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.200> nucleus<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.860> George

it all starts the nucleus the George

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.980 
it all starts the nucleus the George

to<00:02:11.080> what<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.500> learn<00:02:12.150> there's<00:02:13.150> only<00:02:13.330> one

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
to what I can learn there's only one

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.070 
to what I can learn there's only one
more<00:02:13.690> thing

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
more thing

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.290 
more thing
it's<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> nucleolus<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.430> too<00:02:15.640> makes<00:02:15.850> protein

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
it's the nucleolus it too makes protein

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.160 
it's the nucleolus it too makes protein
that's<00:02:16.570> what<00:02:16.780> student<00:02:17.200> told<00:02:17.500> us<00:02:18.570> yeah<00:02:19.570> yeah

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
that's what student told us yeah yeah

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.940 
that's what student told us yeah yeah
science<00:02:20.860> what's<00:02:21.160> in<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.730> cell<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:23.320> working

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
science what's in the cell it's working

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.850 
science what's in the cell it's working
well<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:26.110> tell<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.730> organelles<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
well and I can tell the organelles the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.860 
well and I can tell the organelles the
way<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.460> works<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:31.300> way<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.680> looks<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.300> here<00:02:34.600> it

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
way it works the way it looks so here it

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.970 
way it works the way it looks so here it
is<00:02:35.489> but<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> bell<00:02:37.330> come<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.110> what's<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
is but as a bell come on what's in the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.180 
is but as a bell come on what's in the
cell<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:40.750> working<00:02:41.440> well<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:43.330> can<00:02:43.600> tell

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
cell it's working well and I can tell

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.860 
cell it's working well and I can tell
the<00:02:45.190> organelles<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:47.350> way<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.920> works<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.870> way

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the organelles the way it works the way

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:04.510 
the organelles the way it works the way
it<00:02:50.140> looks<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> here<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.980> clear<00:02:53.980> as<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> bell

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520
