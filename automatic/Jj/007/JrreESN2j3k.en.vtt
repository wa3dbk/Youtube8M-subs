tap be a lot to pull it down it's
actually<00:01:57.700> going<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.090> create<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.330> dig<00:01:58.600> spot<00:01:58.869> in

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
actually going to create a dig spot in

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.300 
actually going to create a dig spot in
the<00:01:59.080> floor<00:01:59.410> so<00:01:59.860> you're<00:01:59.979> going<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.130> need<00:02:00.250> a

the floor so you're going to need a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.010 
the floor so you're going to need a
character<00:02:00.550> that<00:02:00.670> can<00:02:00.820> dig<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.450> that's<00:02:01.810> going

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
now this next one there's going to be

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.160 
now this next one there's going to be
five<00:02:59.080> sunflowers<00:02:59.830> in<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.010> background<00:03:00.490> and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
five sunflowers in the background and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.200 
five sunflowers in the background and
like<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.520> wolves<00:03:03.790> are<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.150> be

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
like the wolves are going to be

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.150 
like the wolves are going to be
attacking<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.080> will<00:03:05.710> most<00:03:05.890> likely

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
attacking you so you will most likely

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.430 
attacking you so you will most likely
die<00:03:06.430> while<00:03:06.670> trying<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.910> aim<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.090> these<00:03:07.450> but

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
die while trying to aim for these but

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.410 
die while trying to aim for these but
just<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:08.950> ranged<00:03:09.400> character<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.180> just

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
just get a ranged character and just

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.300 
just get a ranged character and just
lock<00:03:10.660> onto<00:03:10.870> them<00:03:11.080> like<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.350> am<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.980> once<00:03:12.190> you

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
lock onto them like I am and once you

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.830 
lock onto them like I am and once you
show<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.610> five<00:03:12.880> it'll<00:03:13.210> automatically<00:03:13.690> be

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
show you five it'll automatically be

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.190 
show you five it'll automatically be
collected<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.350> interior<00:03:14.710> inventory<00:03:16.200> the

collected and interior inventory the
next<00:03:17.500> one<00:03:17.650> though<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.950> you're<00:03:18.070> going<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.220> get<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
next one though is you're going to get a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.780 
next one though is you're going to get a
treasure<00:03:19.270> called<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.010> banana<00:03:21.010> boomerang<00:03:21.250> and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
ring you're actually going to interact

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.270 
ring you're actually going to interact
with<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.010> Wraith<00:03:36.160> objects<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:37.300> make<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.320> like

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
with the Wraith objects to make a like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.580 
with the Wraith objects to make a like
one<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.180> those<00:03:40.330> slammed<00:03:40.840> pads<00:03:41.140> where<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.470> have

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
one of those slammed pads where you have

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
one of those slammed pads where you have
to<00:03:41.680> be<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:41.800> dwarf<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.490> have<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.670> hit<00:03:42.790> X<00:03:42.970> on

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
to be a dwarf and you have to hit X on

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.200 
to be a dwarf and you have to hit X on
them<00:03:43.380> because<00:03:44.610> nobody<00:03:45.610> else<00:03:45.760> can<00:03:45.880> break<00:03:46.060> them

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
them because nobody else can break them

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.930 
them because nobody else can break them
other<00:03:46.360> than<00:03:46.420> doors<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:48.160> banana<00:03:48.340> which<00:03:48.820> is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
other than doors and the banana which is

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.790 
other than doors and the banana which is
actually<00:03:49.180> right<00:03:50.050> up<00:03:50.110> top<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.620> tree

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
actually right up top and that tree

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.100 
actually right up top and that tree
right<00:03:50.830> there<00:03:51.010> once<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.940> hit<00:03:52.090> X<00:03:52.330> will<00:03:52.720> fall

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
right there once you hit X will fall

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.230 
right there once you hit X will fall
down<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.680> that'll<00:03:54.310> be<00:03:54.400> your<00:03:54.550> third<00:03:54.910> treasure

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
down and that'll be your third treasure

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:20.199 
down and that'll be your third treasure
of<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.600> map<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:56.020> of<00:03:56.110> four

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.939 

these<00:04:21.209> next<00:04:21.600> two<00:04:21.720> mini<00:04:21.900> kits<00:04:22.169> are<00:04:22.350> very<00:04:22.560> linear

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
these next two mini kits are very linear

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.430 
these next two mini kits are very linear
there's<00:04:23.610> going<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.910> be<00:04:23.940> five<00:04:24.330> weapons<00:04:24.900> cachets

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
there's going to be five weapons cachets

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.840 
there's going to be five weapons cachets
as<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.889> run<00:04:26.070> around<00:04:26.280> this<00:04:26.340> track<00:04:26.610> right<00:04:26.789> here

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
as you run around this track right here

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.640 
as you run around this track right here
and<00:04:27.300> what<00:04:27.479> you're<00:04:27.570> just<00:04:27.780> going<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.139> do<00:04:28.199> is<00:04:28.289> line

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
and what you're just going to do is line

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.189 
and what you're just going to do is line
up<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.919> run<00:04:29.100> them<00:04:29.250> over<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.840> then<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.139> one

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
up and run them over and then this one

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.900 
up and run them over and then this one
clearly<00:04:31.560> just<00:04:31.919> out<00:04:32.039> in<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.190> open<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.699> you<00:04:32.789> just

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
clearly just out in the open so you just

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.249 
clearly just out in the open so you just
want<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.120> line<00:04:33.330> up<00:04:33.509> with<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.840> catch<00:04:34.229> it

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
want to line up with it and catch it

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.460 
want to line up with it and catch it
there<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:36.120> these<00:04:36.750> are<00:04:36.960> probably<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.350> two

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
there but these are probably the two

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.320 
there but these are probably the two

two slots that is jumped off of and then

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
treasure of the level which is a paint

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.070

like<00:04:59.099> bow<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.669> arrow<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.509> shoots<00:05:00.750> paint

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080

like bow and arrow and it shoots paint
barrels<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.930> then<00:05:03.979> simply<00:05:04.979> go<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.120> way<00:05:06.270> that

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
barrels and then simply go the way that

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.350 
barrels and then simply go the way that
you<00:05:06.539> would<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.639> extend<00:05:08.639> your<00:05:09.030> reach

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360

you would have to to extend your reach
into<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.690> level<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:11.490> will<00:05:11.610> actually

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
into the level and you will actually

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.600 
into the level and you will actually
break<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.419> wall<00:05:12.780> there<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.310> just<00:05:14.370> need<00:05:14.580> a
