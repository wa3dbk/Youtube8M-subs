I'd<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.009> about<00:01:32.159> how<00:01:32.429> probably<00:01:32.640> on

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
I'd have to think about how probably on

Pierpoint<00:01:33.539> I<00:01:33.719> would<00:01:33.899> say<00:01:34.109> I<00:01:34.140> mean<00:01:34.409> oh<00:01:34.530> I'm

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
Pierpoint I would say I mean oh I'm

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.959 
Pierpoint I would say I mean oh I'm
Pierre<00:01:34.829> pointing<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.820> were

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
Pierre pointing it's a they were

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.749 
Pierre pointing it's a they were
fantastic<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.929> full<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.009> fish<00:01:38.219> and<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> think

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
fantastic and full of fish and I think

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.399 
fantastic and full of fish and I think
you<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> success<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.049> had<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.469> as<00:01:40.710> well

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
you know the success I had there as well

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.919 
you know the success I had there as well
made<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.219> a<00:01:44.280> lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.759> sort<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.539> put<00:01:45.719> in<00:01:45.810> me

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
made up for a lot of sort of put in me

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.949 
made up for a lot of sort of put in me
England<00:01:46.439> team<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.799> think<00:01:49.939> my<00:01:50.939> strengths<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> an

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
England team I think my strengths of an

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.469 
England team I think my strengths of an
angle<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.530> an<00:01:52.709> angler<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.429> think<00:01:54.240> probably

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
angle as an angler I think probably

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.580 
angle as an angler I think probably
being<00:01:54.810> able<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.140> pick<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:56.959> things<00:01:57.959> that<00:01:58.200> make

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
being able to pick out things that make

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910 
being able to pick out things that make
a<00:01:58.619> difference<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.420> often<00:02:00.929> I<00:02:01.200> think

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
a difference and and often I think

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
a difference and and often I think
probably<00:02:02.280> through<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> World<00:02:02.970> Championships

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
probably through a World Championships

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.880 
probably through a World Championships
experience<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:05.099> I<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:06.329> probably<00:02:07.110> tiniest

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
experience just I think probably tiniest

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.319

stubborn and it takes a little bit to
convince<00:02:26.370> me<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.790> something's<00:02:27.510> right<00:02:28.400> but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
convince me that something's right but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.759

once I know something's right I can

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.430 
once I know something's right I can
focus<00:02:32.069> on<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.579> then<00:02:35.480> best<00:02:36.480> anglers<00:02:37.079> I've<00:02:37.290> ever

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
focus on it then best anglers I've ever

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.680 
focus on it then best anglers I've ever
fish<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.889> I<00:02:37.920> would<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.340> William<00:02:38.760> raising<00:02:39.389> for

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
fish we I would so William raising for

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.729 
fish we I would so William raising for
one<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> definite<00:02:41.160> factor<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.739> mean

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
one for a definite factor because I mean

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.500 
one for a definite factor because I mean
William<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.579> don't<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.599> he's<00:02:46.139> very<00:02:47.510> good

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
William I don't know he's very good

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.900 
William I don't know he's very good
always<00:02:48.959> been<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.769> right<00:02:50.160> method

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
always been on the right method

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.710 
always been on the right method
so<00:02:51.810> William<00:02:52.139> certainly<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.450> think

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so William certainly for one and I think

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.050 
so William certainly for one and I think
probably<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.980> angler<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.549> probably<00:02:56.880> has<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
probably one angler that probably has to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
probably one angler that probably has to
work<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.599> little<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:57.959> harder<00:02:58.170> at<00:02:58.590> his<00:02:58.739> fishing

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
work a little bit harder at his fishing

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.940 
work a little bit harder at his fishing
