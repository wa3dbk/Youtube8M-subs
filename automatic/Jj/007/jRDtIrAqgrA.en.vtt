hello<00:01:02.809> Clea<00:01:03.140> are<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.159> busy<00:01:04.390> please<00:01:05.390> come<00:01:05.659> in

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
hello Clea are you busy please come in

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.359 
hello Clea are you busy please come in
I'd<00:01:06.560> like<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.040> company<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:12.500> Tagore<00:01:12.800> said<00:01:13.040> your

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
I'd like the company in Tagore said your

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.040 
I'd like the company in Tagore said your
research<00:01:13.850> held<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.240> key<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.390> activating<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
research held the key to activating the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.490 
research held the key to activating the
machinery<00:01:15.500> how<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.610> my<00:01:17.420> research<00:01:17.960> explores

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
machinery how so my research explores

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.980 
machinery how so my research explores
the<00:01:18.860> relationship<00:01:18.979> between<00:01:19.700> people<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the relationship between people and the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.620 
the relationship between people and the
machinery<00:01:21.500> they<00:01:21.740> develop<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:23.210> ways<00:01:23.390> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
machinery they develop and the ways the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.590 
machinery they develop and the ways the
machinery<00:01:24.110> develops<00:01:24.560> people<00:01:24.979> in<00:01:25.100> turn<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.119> why

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
machinery develops people in turn so why

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.359 
machinery develops people in turn so why
did<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.780> need<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.110> manufacture<00:01:27.350> X<00:01:27.920> amorphs

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
did you need to manufacture X amorphs

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.980 
did you need to manufacture X amorphs
couldn't<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.270> prove<00:01:29.479> your<00:01:29.660> theory<00:01:29.869> without

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
couldn't you prove your theory without

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.560 
couldn't you prove your theory without
them<00:01:30.380> of<00:01:30.530> course<00:01:31.130> if<00:01:31.880> Quinto<00:01:32.300> hadn't

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
them of course if Quinto hadn't

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.749 
them of course if Quinto hadn't
activated<00:01:32.899> those<00:01:33.259> terrifying<00:01:33.860> creatures<00:01:34.399> we

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
activated those terrifying creatures we

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.460 
activated those terrifying creatures we
could<00:01:34.940> have<00:01:35.030> completed<00:01:35.420> our<00:01:35.570> research<00:01:36.020> by<00:01:36.229> now

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
could have completed our research by now

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.680 
could have completed our research by now
you<00:01:36.860> didn't<00:01:37.100> want<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.369> create<00:01:37.580> X<00:01:37.789> amorphs<00:01:38.179> it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
you didn't want to create X amorphs it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.719 
you didn't want to create X amorphs it
was<00:01:38.899> breathtaking<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.950> see<00:01:40.220> them<00:01:40.399> come<00:01:40.610> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
was breathtaking to see them come to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.919 
was breathtaking to see them come to
life<00:01:41.380> but<00:01:42.380> risky<00:01:42.890> when<00:01:43.880> they<00:01:44.060> turned<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:44.539> us<00:01:44.600> I

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
life but risky when they turned on us I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.740 
life but risky when they turned on us I
was<00:01:45.560> sure<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.070> were<00:01:46.100> dead<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.970> happened<00:01:47.330> they

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
was sure we were dead what happened they

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.490 
was sure we were dead what happened they
chased<00:01:48.140> us<00:01:48.410> from<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.770> lab<00:01:49.030> we<00:01:50.030> were<00:01:50.210> safe<00:01:50.539> but

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
chased us from the lab we were safe but

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.050 
chased us from the lab we were safe but
we<00:01:51.679> had<00:01:51.830> no<00:01:52.070> way<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.340> communicate<00:01:52.640> with

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
we had no way to communicate with

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.390 
we had no way to communicate with
crendor<00:01:53.660> or<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.929> scientists<00:01:54.650> on<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.920> surface

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
crendor or the scientists on the surface

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.520 
crendor or the scientists on the surface
I<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:56.840> terrified<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.939> then<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.960> were<00:02:00.170> there

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
I was terrified and then you were there

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.700 
I was terrified and then you were there
hmm<00:02:01.490> tell<00:02:02.119> me<00:02:02.240> clear<00:02:02.479> what<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:03.229> your<00:02:03.350> research

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
hmm tell me clear what if your research

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.410 
hmm tell me clear what if your research
shows<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.400> it'd<00:02:04.549> rule<00:02:04.759> did<00:02:04.939> not<00:02:05.150> make

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
shows that the it'd rule did not make

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420 
shows that the it'd rule did not make
the<00:02:05.540> ruins<00:02:05.840> then<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.619> will<00:02:06.740> publish<00:02:07.220> my

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430
