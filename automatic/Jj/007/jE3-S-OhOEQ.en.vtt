 A song that praises Jesus who saved me . 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:35.290
 Jesus, looking at the appearance of worship with me friends, I feel a song before 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.110

 Anise. It's been a while. How have you been? 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:01.490
 I did it again next time. I was on vacation. I came down to protect Ramadan with my family. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.880
 Yes, fasting is good. 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:10.120
 You are 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.120

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.849
 I decided to meet them at night with you, and you will come. 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 Oh , I will go to your house at night. 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:27.560
 Let's go out after a meal with the family all over the street colorful 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:34.060
 The lights illuminate the roads and people are bustling around the tea houses and streets. 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.060
 Numerous people ate and drank freely, celebrating daytime fasting 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:49.610
 Anise . You gotta get up. Mom. I fell asleep. It's only been two hours. 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.610
 Little fucker.Come'm better now, do not eat rice stick incumbent harder whip up eating rice 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:03.480
 During the Ramadan period , pray during the day and at night you can not eat food during the day 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 I was too tired and I had to suffer from indigestion as I was eating and meeting my friends . 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:12.969
 Eventually I abandoned forced up the cloth contains enough sleep between the temple 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.359
 Ah , already time has come this way. 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:19.530
 If I could not do it in the middle of the day, 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.530
 I get 2 in the evening . 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.889
 Look at that person and eat rice in Ramadan period. 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.130
 Those people will throw Allah into hell. 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.759
 I really like those people in my heart. 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:40.449
 Of course I will throw Allah into hell. 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.449
 Heaven can only go to people who are fasting like me . 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.210
 I will be able to enjoy freedom and joy through fasting in the short term. 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.710
 I thought 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:05:00.380
 The more I fasted, the more I would be pleased with Allah 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.550
 As it began to be questioned over time become more emptiness we can have joy 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.470
 In the middle 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.470
 I like things more confusing except 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:16.370
 Allah 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:21.110
 What is the problem? How can I worship you happily? 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:25.160
 Jesus forgave all my sins. 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.790
 So I'm happiest when I worship. 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.790
 Jesus 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.210
 Who 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.230
 Anise, what's going on? 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.230
 I did not have a cat. 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.060
 Just for you 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:49.280
 I am worshiping now . 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.280
 I 'll sing that song the other night . 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.920
 For example 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.069
 a lie 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:10.580
 Almost something that stuck in my heart when you worship Him with friends 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.580
 The inside was filled with a piercing, hot thing. 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:21.110
 I wish I could have a real joy through Jesus. 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.110
 Please read this book by all means 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:32.750
 After accepting Jesus, the emptiness that could not be filled in before was lost 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.750
 Full of freedom and glad 2 filled my life 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.030
 Jesus is the Son of God. 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:44.260
 He came to earth for our sins. 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:48.270
 How do you sound ridiculous that people think 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:51.500
 Jesus is the one who saved us. 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.500
 I am also a Christian.
