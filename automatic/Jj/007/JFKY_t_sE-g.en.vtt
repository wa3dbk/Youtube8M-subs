sledgehammer<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.079> next<00:03:36.290> thing<00:03:36.410> is

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
sledgehammer the next thing is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.740 
sledgehammer the next thing is
scorestreaks<00:03:37.430> what<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:38.150> already<00:03:38.329> have<00:03:38.600> you

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
scorestreaks what we already have you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.080 
scorestreaks what we already have you
know<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:38.959> look<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.260> like<00:03:39.440> killstreaks<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:41.060> I
