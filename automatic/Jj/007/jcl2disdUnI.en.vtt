00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the tippy top of my base now it's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.970 
the tippy top of my base now it's
thinking<00:03:11.840> about<00:03:11.989> putting<00:03:12.140> mortar<00:03:12.530> inside

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
thinking about putting mortar inside

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.220 
thinking about putting mortar inside
here<00:03:13.280> where<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.580> dark<00:03:14.120> elixir<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.630> but<00:03:15.170> I

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
here where this dark elixir is but I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.630 
here where this dark elixir is but I
kind<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.440> did<00:03:15.590> one<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.739> wanted<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.220> keep<00:03:16.340> my<00:03:16.400> dark

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
kind of did one I wanted to keep my dark

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.220 
kind of did one I wanted to keep my dark
elixir<00:03:16.820> on<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.209> inside<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.810> base<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.140> know

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
elixir on the inside of the base I know

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.479 
elixir on the inside of the base I know
that<00:03:18.380> there<00:03:18.470> are<00:03:18.590> three<00:03:18.830> storages<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
that there are three storages in the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.520 
that there are three storages in the
core<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.630> good<00:03:20.840> thing<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.500> I

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
core but the good thing is that so I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.170 
core but the good thing is that so I
move<00:03:21.799> these<00:03:22.040> storages<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.760> storage<00:03:22.970> from

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
move these storages this storage from

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.000 
move these storages this storage from
here<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.780> was<00:03:24.019> originally<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:24.830> moved

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
here it was originally here and I moved

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.610 
here it was originally here and I moved
it<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> core<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.110> it's<00:03:27.110> better<00:03:27.320> because

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
it to the core and it's better because

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.320 
it to the core and it's better because
people<00:03:27.650> can<00:03:28.130> attack<00:03:28.400> from<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.910> side<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
people can attack from this side of the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.539 
people can attack from this side of the
base<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.780> then<00:03:30.470> just<00:03:30.950> get<00:03:31.130> all<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.370> my

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
base and then just get all of my

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.090 
base and then just get all of my
storages<00:03:32.209> if<00:03:32.420> they<00:03:32.630> attack<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.410> then<00:03:33.530> go<00:03:33.709> left

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
storages if they attack and then go left

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.460 
storages if they attack and then go left
they'll<00:03:34.549> get<00:03:34.700> like<00:03:34.910> all<00:03:35.090> four<00:03:35.330> storages<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:35.930> at

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
they'll get like all four storages so at

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.750 
they'll get like all four storages so at
least<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.769> couple<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.160> my<00:03:37.280> storages<00:03:37.670> are

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
least a couple of my storages are

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.220 
least a couple of my storages are
protected<00:03:38.209> on<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.330> middle<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.720> base<00:03:38.900> and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
protected on the middle of the base and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.810

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
and I did kick out the archer tower so

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.229 
and I did kick out the archer tower so
the<00:04:00.890> archer<00:04:01.130> towers<00:04:01.370> on<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.579> edge<00:04:01.700> here<00:04:02.060> and

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239

so<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:35.990> kicked<00:04:36.530> them<00:04:36.620> out<00:04:36.770> on<00:04:37.009> on<00:04:37.310> both<00:04:37.580> sides<00:04:37.849> of

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
so I kicked them out on on both sides of

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.029 
so I kicked them out on on both sides of
the<00:04:38.030> space<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.539> I<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.080> like<00:04:39.319> them<00:04:39.500> over<00:04:39.680> here

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
the space and I do like them over here

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.550 
the space and I do like them over here
because<00:04:40.370> they<00:04:40.550> not<00:04:40.699> only<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:42.110> know<00:04:42.139> defend

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
because they not only you know defend

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.809 
because they not only you know defend
this<00:04:42.740> whole<00:04:42.919> side<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.310> base<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:43.639> they<00:04:43.729> do

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
this whole side of the base but they do

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.700 
this whole side of the base but they do
defend<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.300> core<00:04:44.509> each<00:04:44.720> each<00:04:45.110> one<00:04:45.289> defends

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
defend the core each each one defends

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.460 
defend the core each each one defends
like<00:04:45.889> like<00:04:46.729> I<00:04:46.910> would<00:04:47.330> say<00:04:47.419> 80%<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.169> core<00:04:48.380> on

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
like like I would say 80% of the core on

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.409 
like like I would say 80% of the core on
on<00:04:48.650> one<00:04:48.919> side<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:49.490> they'll<00:04:50.000> still<00:04:50.150> be<00:04:50.180> able<00:04:50.360> to

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
on one side so they'll still be able to

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.629 
on one side so they'll still be able to
protect<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.780> loot<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.139> there<00:04:52.009> are<00:04:52.160> Tesla's

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
protect the loot and there are Tesla's

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.920 
protect the loot and there are Tesla's
all<00:04:52.880> up<00:04:53.060> in<00:04:53.180> here<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.389> will<00:04:53.599> also<00:04:53.780> protect

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
all up in here that will also protect

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.420 
all up in here that will also protect
the<00:04:54.139> loot<00:04:54.259> king<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.620> queen

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
the loot king and queen

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.010 
the loot king and queen
right<00:04:56.030> up<00:04:56.180> in<00:04:56.240> here<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.539> probably<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.870> best

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
right up in here is probably the best

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.480 
right up in here is probably the best
spot<00:04:57.139> formed<00:04:57.650> just<00:04:57.710> because<00:04:58.069> they<00:04:58.280> can

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
spot formed just because they can

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.330 
spot formed just because they can
protect<00:04:59.380> just<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.530> right<00:05:00.680> side<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:01.009> your<00:05:01.039> base

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
protect just the right side of your base

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.310 
protect just the right side of your base
and<00:05:01.610> they<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.419> protect<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.750> loot<00:05:02.960> as<00:05:03.110> well

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
and they can protect your loot as well

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.480 
and they can protect your loot as well

so that's just another good spot for

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.270 
so that's just another good spot for
them<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.380> other<00:05:06.380> than<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.740> that's<00:05:06.889> really

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280

Hall<00:05:25.759> over<00:05:26.000> here<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.389> then<00:05:26.479> that's<00:05:26.630> kind<00:05:26.840> of

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
Hall over here and then that's kind of

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.070 
Hall over here and then that's kind of
how<00:05:26.960> you<00:05:27.020> push<00:05:27.440> with<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:27.830> base<00:05:28.069> but<00:05:28.310> if<00:05:29.270> you

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
how you push with this base but if you

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.659 
how you push with this base but if you
know<00:05:30.169> only<00:05:30.440> put<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.860> tunnel<00:05:31.099> inside<00:05:31.400> if

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
know only put the tunnel inside if

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.249 
know only put the tunnel inside if
you're<00:05:32.180> like<00:05:32.330> below<00:05:32.599> Master<00:05:32.990> League<00:05:33.139> if

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
you're like below Master League if

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.050 
you're like below Master League if
you're<00:05:33.409> in<00:05:33.500> Master<00:05:33.889> League<00:05:34.039> I<00:05:34.280> would<00:05:34.520> suggest

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
you're in Master League I would suggest

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.570 
you're in Master League I would suggest
just<00:05:35.599> kicking<00:05:36.199> it<00:05:36.289> outside<00:05:36.650> like<00:05:36.949> especially

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
just kicking it outside like especially

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
just kicking it outside like especially
it<00:05:37.849> like<00:05:38.060> when<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.270> hit<00:05:38.389> like<00:05:38.509> masters<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.050> a

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
it like when you hit like masters to a

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.080 
it like when you hit like masters to a
tunnel<00:05:39.380> nine<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.889> would<00:05:40.400> say<00:05:40.550> kick<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:40.849> tunnel

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
tunnel nine I would say kick the tunnel

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.200 
tunnel nine I would say kick the tunnel
outside<00:05:41.419> but<00:05:41.659> yeah<00:05:42.560> that's<00:05:42.710> probably<00:05:43.070> fort<00:05:44.060> if

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
outside but yeah that's probably fort if

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.520 
outside but yeah that's probably fort if
you<00:05:44.300> want<00:05:44.449> to<00:05:44.509> go<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.630> champion<00:05:45.050> league<00:05:45.349> or

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
you want to go to champion league or

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.990 
you want to go to champion league or
masters<00:05:46.070> League<00:05:46.310> or<00:05:46.460> whatever<00:05:46.729> you<00:05:46.789> want<00:05:46.940> to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
masters League or whatever you want to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.939 
masters League or whatever you want to
go<00:05:47.120> this<00:05:47.300> is<00:05:47.419> probably<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:47.990> best<00:05:48.169> base<00:05:48.560> still

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
go this is probably the best base still

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.209 
go this is probably the best base still
use<00:05:49.159> for<00:05:49.430> one<00:05:49.639> and<00:05:50.020> it's<00:05:51.020> probably<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.949> best

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
use for one and it's probably the best

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.649 
use for one and it's probably the best
strategy<00:05:52.699> to<00:05:52.759> use<00:05:52.880> just<00:05:53.030> keep<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.360> tunnel

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
strategy to use just keep the tunnel

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.779 
strategy to use just keep the tunnel
outside<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:54.320> hope<00:05:55.130> for<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.310> free<00:05:55.520> shield

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
outside and hope for the free shield
