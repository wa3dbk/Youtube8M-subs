 of life type starbucks are not 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.370
 exactly how they prepare it but 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:53.180
 they are almost alike and the taste I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 I dare to assure you that it's almost the same 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 with the difference that these drinks 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.469
 that I'm going to show you how to prepare it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.899
 yourself in the comfort of your home 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.290
 they go much cheaper and without more 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.540
 preambles let's see how they are made 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.970
 and the first drink that we are going to prepare 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 today is a step of l'ebre 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.670
 and this is the only thing we are going to need 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.880
 sachets of tea like this this I what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.100
 I bought in I loaded lemonade water ice and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.040
 some raspberries 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.460
 what we are going to do first is to grab 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.759
 a little bit of water about one 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.070
 house for this drink I do not have a few 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.500
 more or less accurate measurements you 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.530
 we calculate everything to the eye 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.380
 and we are going to put the tea bag and the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.800
 we let stand about 5 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.800
 minutes 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.930
 Today I also want to mention that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.470
 this green tea box of sachets and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.410
 it cost me like two 250 dollars out there and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 The ingredients of this test are 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.480
 orange cascaritas jamaica cinnamon and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.710
 fruit extract 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.440
 as you can see here I'm re 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.330
 using a glass of starbucks but you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.330
 you can use your favorite glass 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.430
 and we add the store 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.450
 and now we are ready to add you 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.730
 whole 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.640
 and finally we add the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.710
 raspberries 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.340
 If you like sweet things, you can 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:47.560
 add one or two teaspoons of sugar 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.560
 but for me that's perfect 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.780
 and while ensuring the taste is almost 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.180
 almost like you've been with the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.129
 difference that this metal is super 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 gratísimo because to be more gans or 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.459
 less is paying you five dollars for 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.459
 a drink like this 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.070
 this second drink is a mouth 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.800
 frappuccino with coffee for lovers 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.440
 of coffee and chocolate as I am 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.950
 drink is perfect is super easy to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.959
 do and let's see how it's done 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.410
 and these are the ingredients that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.780
 we need a cup of coffee to me 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.640
 I really like coffee but if you do not 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.129
 he wants is so strong he only puts half 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.849
 we also go sometimes need 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.880
 chocolate liquid whipped cream milk and 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.220
 ice 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.040
 to start preparing is delicious 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.620
 drink we will need 1/3 ticket or 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.670
 a blender and we're going to add a 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.670
 little bit of crime ' 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.400
 since we have two crimes in the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.000
 blender we are going to add our coffee 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.420
 As I already told you to taste, we added the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.420
 milk 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.380
 add a little chocolate 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.930
 also if you like you can add 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.630
 sugar but I'm trying to cut 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.690
 a little bit of sugar and I like it that way 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.560
 more sugar free and now we can not very 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 well in the blender 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.630
 and if you want to just add a little 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.630
 more chocolate around your base 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:47.880
 and almost to finish just add 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:52.220
 whipped cream 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.220
 and a little more chocolate 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.790
 ah 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.550
 that comes out super easy and super fast 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.340
 prepare these divisions of lives that 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.460
 they do not come out super cheap if we do them in 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.860
 house and now occasionally they are not 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.200
 just go out and give us 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.210
 our tastes but I wanted them 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.850
 share these two ideas for those days 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.220

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.950
 of something refreshing because here you have 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.900

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.970
