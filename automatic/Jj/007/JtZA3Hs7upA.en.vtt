00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
completely flattened it out and it looks

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.979 
completely flattened it out and it looks
semi<00:03:32.519> perfect<00:03:32.969> now<00:03:33.419> you're<00:03:33.569> going<00:03:33.719> to<00:03:33.780> stick

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
semi perfect now you're going to stick

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.509 
semi perfect now you're going to stick
it<00:03:34.109> in<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.200> fridge<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.530> three<00:03:35.010> hours<00:03:35.129> so<00:03:35.459> it

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
it in the fridge for three hours so it

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.970 
it in the fridge for three hours so it
can<00:03:35.669> solidify<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.599> become<00:03:37.079> more<00:03:37.769> pudding

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
can solidify and become more pudding

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.949 
can solidify and become more pudding
