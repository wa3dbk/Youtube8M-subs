00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
enemy ship with a shell you need to know

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.630 
enemy ship with a shell you need to know
how<00:01:53.969> far<00:01:54.299> away<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> aim<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.890> these<00:01:56.070> battleships

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
how far away to aim so these battleships

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
how far away to aim so these battleships
had<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> pair<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> periscopes<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:58.049> ten

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
had a pair of periscopes about ten

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.679 
had a pair of periscopes about ten
metres<00:01:58.680> apart<00:01:58.799> which<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.820> both<00:02:00.030> produce<00:02:00.329> an

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
metres apart which would both produce an

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.319 
metres apart which would both produce an
image<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> enemy<00:02:01.350> ship<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:03.000> ship<00:02:03.180> was

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
image of the enemy ship if the ship was

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.039 
image of the enemy ship if the ship was
far<00:02:03.570> away

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
far away

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
far away
both<00:02:04.350> periscopes<00:02:04.979> would<00:02:05.219> point<00:02:05.460> almost

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
both periscopes would point almost

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080 
both periscopes would point almost
directly<00:02:06.450> ahead<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.200> both<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.829> ship<00:02:08.160> but

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
directly ahead and both see the ship but

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.210 
directly ahead and both see the ship but
if<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.299> was<00:02:09.390> close<00:02:09.720> by<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.530> periscopes<00:02:11.039> would

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
if it was close by the periscopes would

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.280 
if it was close by the periscopes would
have<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> point<00:02:11.700> inwards<00:02:12.299> to<00:02:12.540> both<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.900> able<00:02:13.019> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
have to point inwards to both be able to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.009 
have to point inwards to both be able to
view<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.590> target<00:02:14.120> how<00:02:15.120> much<00:02:15.450> they<00:02:15.690> had<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
view the target how much they had to

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.050 
view the target how much they had to
point<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.470> told<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.250> distance<00:02:17.639> to<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> enemy

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
point in told the distance to the enemy

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.539 
point in told the distance to the enemy
ship<00:02:18.449> and<00:02:18.660> therefore<00:02:19.380> how<00:02:19.590> far<00:02:19.889> away<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.220> aim

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
ship and therefore how far away to aim

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.780 
ship and therefore how far away to aim
the<00:02:20.760> shell<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:22.320> how<00:02:22.470> does<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.769> work<00:02:22.949> in<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> cam

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the shell so how does this work in a cam

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.840 
the shell so how does this work in a cam
well<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.020> manual<00:02:25.410> SLR<00:02:26.010> camera<00:02:26.490> which<00:02:26.730> of

same setup inside the camera there are

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
same setup inside the camera there are
two<00:02:33.600> mirrors<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.500> change<00:02:34.800> the

most modern autofocusing SLR cameras use

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
most modern autofocusing SLR cameras use
this<00:02:47.520> principle<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.570> instead<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.930> moving<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
this principle but instead of moving the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.250 
this principle but instead of moving the
mirrors<00:02:49.950> manually<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:50.940> use<00:02:51.120> two<00:02:51.450> electronic

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
mirrors manually they use two electronic

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
mirrors manually they use two electronic
sensors<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.070> look<00:02:53.220> at<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.460> views<00:02:53.730> from<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
sensors to look at the views from the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.780 
sensors to look at the views from the
two<00:02:54.180> mirrors<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:55.100> computer<00:02:56.100> chip<00:02:56.250> inside<00:02:56.460> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
two mirrors a computer chip inside the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.670 
two mirrors a computer chip inside the
camera<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.330> takes<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.930> two<00:02:58.110> images<00:02:58.320> from

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
camera then takes the two images from

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.800 
camera then takes the two images from
the<00:02:58.770> sensors<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.370> compares<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.330> pattern<00:03:00.690> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the sensors and compares the pattern of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.840 
the sensors and compares the pattern of
light<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.020> dark<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.710> find<00:03:02.310> where<00:03:02.670> they

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
light and dark to find where they

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.760 
light and dark to find where they
overlap<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.510> therefore<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.200> distance<00:03:04.560> of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
overlap and therefore the distance of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.100 
overlap and therefore the distance of
the<00:03:04.860> object<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:06.060> computer<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:06.660> tells<00:03:06.990> the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the object the computer then tells the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.020 
the object the computer then tells the
focus<00:03:07.530> ring<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.920> turn<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:08.430> distance

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
