different kinds of supplies err so that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.760 
different kinds of supplies err so that
we<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.629> number<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
we have the number one we have just

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
we have the number one we have just
normal<00:00:59.129> supply<00:00:59.250> drops<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
normal supply drops and then we have the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
normal supply drops and then we have the
number<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> advanced<00:01:02.550> supply<00:01:02.940> drops<00:01:02.969> how

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

professional<00:01:15.840> item<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.920> usually<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
professional item but usually you get a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
lot better stuff than normal so they're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760 
lot better stuff than normal so they're
really<00:01:20.250> cool<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.140> most<00:01:22.140> people<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
really cool but most people think that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
really cool but most people think that
you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.040> only<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.640> by<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.570> buying

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you can only get them by actually buying

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.630 
you can only get them by actually buying
them<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.439> they're<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.280> cheap

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
them and they're not really that cheap

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
them and they're not really that cheap
either<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.270> they're<00:01:27.420> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> pricey<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.439> guess

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
either so they're kind of pricey I guess

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
either so they're kind of pricey I guess
it's<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.009> two<00:01:29.189> dollars<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.729> stuff<00:01:29.939> like
