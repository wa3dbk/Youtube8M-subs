00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good only everyone this time we have a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.420
 authentic war of titans war of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.730
 two incredible beasts but it's not about 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.130
 of this aberration but on the one hand 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 we have our brand pyra ming 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 sen show that was leading the market 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.609
 of the pyramids for a long time and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.890
 still going strong without doubt and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.710
 On the other hand our motion our 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 pira mix of the moya brand that looks like 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 they have proposed to unseat all 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.740
 other brands that were already consecrated 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 so let's see who wins this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.820
 magnificent showdown 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.650
 Well, we started this battle 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.750
 comparing the aesthetic part that is not 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.730
 the one that matters most to us but is always 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.560
 well be comfortable also with the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.620
 appearance of a cube to make it 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.810
 our ideal cube forever here 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.410
 we counted on that the sensor was the 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.270
 first to put these stickers like this 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.100
 phosphorites at the time there were not so many 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.760
 cubes with this sticker is one time then 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.440
 it came out moyo, as I did 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.290
 stickers practically the same style 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.720
 and many other brands targeted the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.270
 cart here we have some stickers 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.800
 quite striking for its time and that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.220
 they are still pretty nice 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.310
 although if we compare them with those of moyo 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.920
 the differences are tiny we can by 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.940
 example the green is a little bit more 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.430
 clarito the blue is also a bit in 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.500
 this case darker in the census and the 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.399
 orange here we have an orange and here 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.770
 Red 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.750
 In general, I like the colors of the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.550
 Dock are a few more colors 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.830
 soft are not as striking as the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.530
 census but 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.540
 and here the differences almost do not 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.010
 we can notice and we already go to the part 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.980
 more interesting what would be the turn 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.170
 first turn of the corner is this 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.700
 it's practically the same in both games 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 both have a click system to the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.910
 same as the large layers the turns 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.490
 larger has a click system in 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.040
 the corners of the tips these are not 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.350
 we noticed hardly difference and where if 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.880
 we noticed already more difference is in these 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.979
 turns that are the ones that we are going to go 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.980
 doing throughout the resolution of 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.110
 cube in this we find a turn 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.660
 the truth very hard 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.340
 that is an excellent turn it seems to me a 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.140
 incredible cube I was using during 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.110
 a lot of time because he was the only one 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.350
 there was and it's a very good turn but 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.240
 comparing it with the motiu we see 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.810
 this is a softer turn in fact 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.470
 even hearing what you already notice this as 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.020
 a much softer twist than that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.940
 we have a good point here in the census 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.850
 what it has is the show is that when 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.640
 we turn we usually face 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.520
 blocked in the full turn what 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 we will avoid blockages in leaving the 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.080
 cubas and he gave me a turn try to turn 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.300
 and that does not turn then this is a great 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.760
 point in this is also going to be 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.350
 stay in your position but it's more 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.480
 likely that if we go over strength it 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.400
 let's stay a little about the past though 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.250
 let's see below that this is not 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.250
 it's a big problem for a lot so 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.660
 the click system is much much much 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.270
 harder here we have to do more 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.390
 strength to start the turn instead in 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.450
 this the click system is very smooth 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.490
 and it will allow you to make very 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.930
 fluids without a doubt this is one of the 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.930
 cubes that impress me the most 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.640
 take out of the box because spin was 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.650
 extremely fluid 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.030
 I did not know it was going to be good but 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.220
 I knew it was going to be both the turn that 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.200
 I had a turn that I like very much and 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.810
 I wish I could be in many other 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.930
 cubes the reason why the turn of the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.450
 sensor is more abrupt I think it's 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.240
 click system that we have these 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.370
 balls both the two marks the ball 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.500
 on bread stand out the same from the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.170
 pieces but we found that in the census 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.890
 these little balls are smaller in the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.440
 in the moyo are larger balls 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.700
 So what are we going to have with this, 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.910
 that there is a jump that the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.190
 piece to get out of your position the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.560
 little ball the jump you have to do in 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.600
 that show is more abrupt than the one that has 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.910
 what to do in May what gives us a turn 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.370
 softer therefore another great success 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.799
 no doubt for the pyramids of the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.900
 very brand 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.879
 it is not with this we pass the final part 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.550
 what would be the cut corners cut 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:27.880
 corners we see that in the moll without getting 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.060
 already to which it would be half 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.120
 we find ourselves with a little less than 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.730
 if he is able to make a good cut of 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.340
 corners I find a cut corners 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.470
 excellent for being a pir amics besides 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.930
 It is quite soft and in small cuts 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.460
 like this that we are the ones who leave the most 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.350
 to find because with a system of 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.270
 click as we have we are not going to 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.670
 find with positions with these to 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.770
 unless we give him very loose cube and 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.270
 does not end up making the most normal turn 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.220
 It is that perhaps we meet 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.710
 This style positions where 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.060
 certainly operates perfectly well 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.070
 that here is everything an extreme champion 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.840
 in the sensor, we also have a 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.440
 good cut corners but does not reach 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.190
 be as good as the devil but 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.180
 not up close if it's good for your moment 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.160
 old was pretty amazing but not 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.380
 have innovated a lot has taken advantage of that 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.690
 situation and has brought out this incredible 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.360
 pira mix that as we have seen has a 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.600
 excellent cut a super smooth twist and 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.120
 more things that we're going to see next 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.230
 this corner cut is so good 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.330
 simply by these pieces we see that 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.550
 they are more rounded here we see that they are 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.430
 more pointed will be already a failure that 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.080
 would be in the design from the beginning of 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.810
 to get it out but how was the best 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.229
 option could not be put too many 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.150
 pegas 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.030
 we have seen that as they have progressed 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.580
 the years cubes fit have had the 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.419
 more rounded pieces because this makes 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.250
 a cut corners much better so in 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.100
 conclusion we have a great victory 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.510
 for the moyo without leaving behind by 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.580
 supposed ascent that remains a 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.620
 excellent option you can have very good 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.100
 times with him there are a lot of records 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.900
 with this cube records 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.660
 so it does not go as much in the cube as in 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.249
 the q but what we do find in 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.429
 montjuïc 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:22.429
 who have given their spectacular success 

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:25.729
 only competed at that time was the the 

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:27.889
 send show that has always played with a 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.839
 great smoothness of movements in their 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.179
 cubes and of course a very price 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.439
 economic whenever we found a 

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:35.359
 cube is that and he's going to have a relationship 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:37.189
 excellent quality-price allowed us 

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:39.649
 have cubes four times four or five 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:41.329
 by five even seven by seven with a 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.549
 more or less reduced price which does not 

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:45.709
 we usually find in the muu brand that 

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:46.909
 usually surpass I know a little in the 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.799
 Prices have excellent quality 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:52.129
 but this quality 

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:54.439
 we will have to pay without doubt 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.599
 change this time what he has done 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:59.119
 what he has chosen as yu is to take a 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.769
 cube of the same quality but to a 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.959
 really very economical price we 

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:05.449
 we found that it is even more economical 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.919
 that the brand's rise so in 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.229
 that has been a total success there is no 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.360
 no reason not to recommend this 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.329
 module you are going to buy a pyramid of 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.419
 first I definitely recommend this this 

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:20.179
 already if you have excellent but for the 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.350
 price that this mode has no doubt 

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:24.130
 included 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.210
 the die in this in this showdown 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.010
 because I still do not have it and in addition 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.310
 According to what I have seen, I do not think it exceeds 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.620
 al moi ni closely changes in sun is a 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.930
 cube we have many and I would be 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.670
 well compare it with this monstrosity 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.650
 that we have so nothing more to say 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.310
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.310
 in the next video
