00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.520

 they would serve no one and the most 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.280

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 he took his pc and inserted the first of the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.939
 games that had been found sonic the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.030
 hedgehog one began to play for a long time 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.600
 the game that did not notice the presence of a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 storm outside with a prolonged time 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.229
 in the PC he managed to finish the first game 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.049
 sonic as he still had battery left 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.929
 enough to your pc and tomorrow not 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.229
 I would work since I had been fired 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:02.520
 opted to play the next sonic game 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.920
 the hedgehog part 2 achieved a longer time 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 that he had done in the first game but 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 in the end the storm managed to finish it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 he went on and he still wanted to continue playing 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.000
 but his pc was almost dead so 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 he decided to load it and continue his game 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.530
 the next game was sonic the hedgehog 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.530
 part 3 but this record was a bit 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.040
 scratched and you could not play it without a the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.459
 that took you out of the game decided to save 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.209
 the game in your usb memory and so you can 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.700
 play it without errors started saving the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.120
 information and the game in his memory 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 while he got the next and last 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.750
 of the discs that had been found at 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.630
 look like this worked well started with 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.230
 the travelers tails logo and then the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.880
 sega icon at the end the title appears 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.739
 of the game that I was going to play are iker e 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.790
 started with a normal game in the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.370
 first track with all the characters 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.160
 unlocked decided to play with metal 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.950
 sonic which meant he was going to 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.730
 run against the best characters of the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:25.370
 game which were super sonic metal 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.159
 robotnik metal core and of course 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.010
 the storm outside was frightening with 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.769
 lightning that illuminated all the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.379
 dark room where he was 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.440
 the subject followed by thunder that 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.799
 it vibrated the windows and activated the 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.860
 car alarms at the end of the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.220
 career had defeated all since 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.280
 had started with a great advantage the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.980
 sonic game 3 was about to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.590
 be completely saved when a 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.590
 lightning lit up the corner more 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.170
 dark from his room and then he fell 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.959
 a terrible thunder that caused a 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.440
 electric shock in the neighborhood where 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.680
 I found how his computer was 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.250
 connected the download also affected it 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.190
 causing it to turn off unplugged 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.250
 and chose to turn it on again but not 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.120
 could apparently had burned the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.750
 annoying hard drive threw his pc to the ground 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.080
 causing it to shatter 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:37.580
 between the broken pieces he found his 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.580
 usb memory which was intact the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.480
 got into his pocket and went to sleep already 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.540
 that tomorrow I should look for a new job 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.420
 as if working was not enough in 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.480
 the morning he woke up and noticed that the day was 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.170
 very beautiful so he came out determined to 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.110
 looking for a new job was a long day 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.750
 search had found three 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.590
 proposals that in his opinion were the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.110
 better than there was for someone like 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.950
 tired looked in his pocket for a bit of 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.840
 money to buy something to eat 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.080
 but money was not the only thing 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.600
 found also found his sd that 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.660
 he had kept the night in his pocket 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.540
 previous there was a public internet 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.690
 so I was saving the desire to 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.350
 eat and like all good geek spent the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.470
 money renting a computer inserted 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.590
 the usb memory in the computer 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.290
 a little bit in detecting what caused the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.830
 man's anguish but in the end it was 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.740
 recognized opened it and found no 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.880
 file except for a folder the 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.460
 which he supposed had the sonic game 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.220
 he opened it and found a file which 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.070
 it was from the game but he also found 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.720
 broken and hybrid files of the games 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:08.780
 they are i3 and they are iker apparently downloading 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.050
 Electric had mixed them creating a 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.660
 just hybrid game but how could 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.890
 affect this the game 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.650
 ignoring this opened the application 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.570
 He spent a long time watching the PC with 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.200
 dark circles in the eyes and mouth 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.900
 half-open had beaten the rent of 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.600
 the computer was also the only 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.200
 client that there was as it was time for 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.810
 close the manager approached to warn 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.600
 that he had to pay and leave and if he wanted 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.390
 return the next day 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.180
 he did not pay attention just followed 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.610
 observing coldly the screen of 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.520
 start of the computer 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.830
 the manager continued to insist 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.880
 that he stopped in a pretty way 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.430
 sharp which scared the manager was 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.460
 he was shaking his head in a way 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.890
 terrifying and it went slowly crossing 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:10.390
 the street without worrying about being 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.430
 hit in the distance was heard as 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.050
 everyone stuttered the words 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.630
 You must see it 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.810
 the manager a little bewildered 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.960
 decided to turn off the computer but before 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.590
 should remove the usb memory that had 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:30.620
 forgotten that strange subject was 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.890
 empty only had one file on 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:37.130
 which had been uploaded to the network in a 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:39.500
 hacked page of games closed the 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.050
 website and it was only in the 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.760
 memory the folder with the name of 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.760
 sonic dot exe
