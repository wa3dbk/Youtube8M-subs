have<00:01:32.369> actually<00:01:32.610> lost<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.850> lot<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> early<00:01:33.299> games

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have actually lost a lot of early games

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
have actually lost a lot of early games
where<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.810> started<00:01:34.049> winning<00:01:34.200> mid<00:01:34.439> games<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
where we started winning mid games and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.230 
where we started winning mid games and
doing<00:01:35.070> dragons<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> stuff<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
doing dragons and stuff like that so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.609 
doing dragons and stuff like that so
you've<00:01:36.329> been<00:01:36.390> focusing<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> lot<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you've been focusing a lot of that and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.310 
you've been focusing a lot of that and
that<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.640> seems<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> work<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.170> you

so<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.259> feel<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.469> you're<00:02:07.890> just

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
so up and down I feel like you're just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.529 
so up and down I feel like you're just
inconsistent<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.789> playing<00:02:09.060> general<00:02:09.360> like

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
inconsistent on playing general like

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.089 
inconsistent on playing general like
sometimes<00:02:10.319> we're<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.560> our<00:02:10.590> game<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.039> should

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
sometimes we're on our game you should

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.559 
sometimes we're on our game you should
call<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> lot<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:11.879> sometimes<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
call a lot and then sometimes we kind of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.530 
call a lot and then sometimes we kind of
silence<00:02:13.020> so

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
silence so

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.850 
silence so
this<00:02:13.810> game<00:02:14.019> doesn't<00:02:14.200> really<00:02:14.409> prove<00:02:14.680> much

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
this game doesn't really prove much

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.140 
this game doesn't really prove much
because<00:02:15.189> it<00:02:15.280> was<00:02:15.370> probably<00:02:15.610> our<00:02:15.730> best<00:02:15.879> game

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
because it was probably our best game

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.539 
because it was probably our best game
and<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:17.170> were<00:02:17.290> fully<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:17.859> top<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.159> our<00:02:18.250> game<00:02:18.310> and

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
and we were fully on top of our game and

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.640 
and we were fully on top of our game and
I<00:02:18.609> don't<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:18.909> natick<00:02:19.209> why<00:02:19.329> not<00:02:19.599> but<00:02:20.290> we

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
I don't know if natick why not but we

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.080 
I don't know if natick why not but we
might<00:02:20.769> not<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.099> next<00:02:21.400> week<00:02:21.579> or<00:02:21.730> next<00:02:21.819> game

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
might not be that next week or next game

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.940 
might not be that next week or next game
so<00:02:22.390> we<00:02:22.689> just<00:02:22.810> need<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.049> get<00:02:23.140> more<00:02:23.260> consistent<00:02:23.769> I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
so we just need to get more consistent I

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.679 
so we just need to get more consistent I
agree<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.849> one<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> think<00:02:25.359> everyone
