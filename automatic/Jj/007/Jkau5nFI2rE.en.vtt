the<00:00:36.630> crib<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.230> navy<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> white<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.790> gray<00:00:38.820> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the crib is navy and white and gray I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
the crib is navy and white and gray I
love<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> scale<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.010> these<00:00:41.190> stripes<00:00:41.550> are

quite<00:00:42.000> thin<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:43.890> makes<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
quite thin and I think it just makes a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
quite thin and I think it just makes a
wonderful<00:00:44.789> statement<00:00:45.059> versus<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> know

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410

the<00:00:46.530> larger<00:00:46.950> stripes<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.309> would<00:00:47.489> typically

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the larger stripes that would typically

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.270
