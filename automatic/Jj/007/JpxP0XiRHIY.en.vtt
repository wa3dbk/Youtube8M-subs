one of the issues I had with the z10 i
still<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.349> here<00:04:19.620> that's<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:19.949> dialer

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
still have here that's with the dialer

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.949 
still have here that's with the dialer
two<00:04:20.880> strikes<00:04:21.120> me<00:04:21.239> as<00:04:21.329> strange<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.779> have<00:04:21.900> a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
two strikes me as strange to have a

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.260 
two strikes me as strange to have a
dialer<00:04:22.380> as<00:04:22.560> app<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:23.159> just

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
dialer as app I just

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.180 
dialer as app I just
it's<00:04:24.629> very<00:04:25.080> very<00:04:25.500> odd<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.770> me<00:04:25.949> to<00:04:26.069> have<00:04:26.160> a

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
it's very very odd to me to have a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.010 
it's very very odd to me to have a
dialer<00:04:26.490> as<00:04:26.610> an<00:04:26.699> application<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.270> wish<00:04:27.449> I<00:04:27.720> know

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
dialer as an application I wish I know

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.619 
dialer as an application I wish I know
inherently<00:04:28.440> it's<00:04:28.919> an<00:04:28.979> app<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.340> everything

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
inherently it's an app and everything

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.790 
inherently it's an app and everything
released<00:04:30.629> for<00:04:30.810> most<00:04:31.050> phones<00:04:31.349> it's<00:04:31.620> always

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
running the backgrounds there's that

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.550 
running the backgrounds there's that
instant<00:04:33.210> load<00:04:33.419> it<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.229> feels<00:04:34.319> like<00:04:34.470> it's

always when I want to run it that I

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.360 
always when I want to run it that I
