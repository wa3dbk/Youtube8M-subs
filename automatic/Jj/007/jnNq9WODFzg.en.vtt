so they have the same exact phones which
it<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.409> stinks<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it kind of stinks because you got the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.950 
it kind of stinks because you got the
waste<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> money<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> buy<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> same

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
waste all that money and buy the same

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480 
waste all that money and buy the same
phone<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> different<00:01:10.830> company<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.369> they

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
phone with a different company when they

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820 
phone with a different company when they
got<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> same<00:01:12.119> phones<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
got all the same phones I think it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
got all the same phones I think it's
kind<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> wrong<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:14.820> how<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
kind of wrong but that's how they do the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499 
kind of wrong but that's how they do the
rules<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.560> guess<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.880> four<00:01:18.240> that's

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
rules so I guess that's just four that's

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
rules so I guess that's just four that's
I<00:01:18.840> guess<00:01:19.080> that's<00:01:19.290> their<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> saying<00:01:19.950> well

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
I guess that's their way of saying well

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
I guess that's their way of saying well
we<00:01:20.310> can't<00:01:20.520> lose<00:01:20.670> money<00:01:20.909> by<00:01:21.210> having<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.049> same

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
we can't lose money by having the same

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
we can't lose money by having the same

with<00:01:47.700> AT&amp;T<00:01:48.439> coverage<00:01:49.439> map<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.759> an

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
with AT&amp;T coverage map if you have an

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.819 
with AT&amp;T coverage map if you have an
area<00:01:51.149> where<00:01:51.180> gsm<00:01:51.780> coverage<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.649> go

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
area where gsm coverage is not good go

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.630 
area where gsm coverage is not good go
with<00:01:52.979> CDMA<00:01:53.460> coverage<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:55.189> just<00:01:56.189> talks<00:01:56.430> with

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
