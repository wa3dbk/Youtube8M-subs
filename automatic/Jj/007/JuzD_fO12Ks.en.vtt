00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
these gargoyles are weak to magic so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
these gargoyles are weak to magic so
it's<00:00:48.239> important<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.899> magic<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.770> much<00:00:49.980> as

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's important to use magic as much as

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.939 
it's important to use magic as much as
you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.440> enter<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> fog

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you can but right when you enter the fog

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.020 
you can but right when you enter the fog
gate<00:00:53.190> turn<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.640> left

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
gate turn to your left

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
gate turn to your left
now<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> gargoyle<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:56.010> takes<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.399> few<00:00:56.579> seconds

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
now this gargoyle it takes a few seconds

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
now this gargoyle it takes a few seconds
for<00:00:57.059> him<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.570> loose<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.079> start<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.379> attack

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
for him to get loose and start to attack

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
for him to get loose and start to attack
you<00:00:58.890> which<00:00:59.460> means<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.270> able<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.600> get

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.390 
that's all of our gargoyles five
gargoyles<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.620> what<00:02:01.620> you<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.190> as

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
gargoyles so what you want to do as

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.540 
gargoyles so what you want to do as
these<00:02:02.850> gargoyles<00:02:04.070> activate<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
these gargoyles activate and it can be

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.250 
these gargoyles activate and it can be
difficult<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:06.090> tell<00:02:06.240> which<00:02:06.540> gargoyles<00:02:07.140> will

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
difficult to tell which gargoyles will

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.530 
difficult to tell which gargoyles will
activate<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.830> which<00:02:08.010> one<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:09.000> need<00:02:09.150> to<00:02:09.270> try<00:02:09.510> to

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
activate in which one you need to try to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.540 
activate in which one you need to try to
avoid<00:02:09.660> hitting<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.500> gargoyles<00:02:11.220> they're

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
avoid hitting the gargoyles they're

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.440 
avoid hitting the gargoyles they're
stationary<00:02:12.270> because<00:02:13.020> if<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:14.220> gargoyle<00:02:14.820> gets

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
stationary because if a gargoyle gets

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.860 
stationary because if a gargoyle gets
hit<00:02:15.750> before<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.040> its<00:02:17.720> prerequisites<00:02:18.720> are

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
hit before all of its prerequisites are

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.030 
hit before all of its prerequisites are
met<00:02:18.930> then<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.400> will<00:02:20.550> still<00:02:20.820> activate<00:02:22.040> anyway

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
met then it will still activate anyway

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.100 
met then it will still activate anyway
even<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.790> didn't<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.420> life<00:02:24.600> bar<00:02:24.900> down

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
even if you didn't get the life bar down

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.280 
even if you didn't get the life bar down
to<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.560> appropriate<00:02:26.250> spot<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.870> need<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
to the appropriate spot so you need to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.010 
to the appropriate spot so you need to
need<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.130> make<00:02:29.280> sure<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.870> other

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
need to make sure of that now the other

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.500 
need to make sure of that now the other
thing<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:31.710> these<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.060> may<00:02:33.270> be

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
thing is as these you it may be

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.360 
thing is as these you it may be
difficult<00:02:33.990> for<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.260> keep<00:02:34.500> track<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:35.010> when

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
difficult for you to keep track of when

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.490 
difficult for you to keep track of when
each<00:02:35.670> gargoyle<00:02:36.210> starts<00:02:36.570> activating<00:02:36.960> because

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
each gargoyle starts activating because

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 
each gargoyle starts activating because
there's<00:02:37.680> five<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.670> what<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.880> want<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.240> do<00:02:39.330> is

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
there's five so what you want to do is

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.670 
there's five so what you want to do is
you<00:02:39.630> need<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.810> pay<00:02:40.050> attention<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.530> your

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
you need to pay attention to your

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
you need to pay attention to your
surroundings<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.700> easy<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.330> get<00:02:42.450> into<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
surroundings it's easy to get into the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.810 
surroundings it's easy to get into the
habit<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.230> locking<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.190> staying<00:02:44.550> locked

habit of locking on and staying locked
onto<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.780> gargoyle<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.040> need<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
onto that one gargoyle but you need to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.050 
onto that one gargoyle but you need to
occasionally<00:02:49.200> deactivate<00:02:50.190> your<00:02:50.340> lock-on<00:02:50.820> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
occasionally deactivate your lock-on and

look around and make sure that all of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160 
look around and make sure that all of
the<00:02:53.010> gargoyles<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.850> front<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.630> you

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
special resistances imagine what you can

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.030 
special resistances imagine what you can
do<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:15.410> smell<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.440> has<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
to hit even more than one gargoyle so

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.619 
to hit even more than one gargoyle so
just<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:34.590> mindful<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.099> that<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:36.209> other<00:03:36.360> thing

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
you may need to do is bait the gargoyles

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.449

what<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.450> means<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.810> bait<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.290> gargoyle<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:41.190> to

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
what it means to bait the gargoyle is to

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.610 
what it means to bait the gargoyle is to
get<00:03:41.670> close<00:03:42.150> enough<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.260> start
