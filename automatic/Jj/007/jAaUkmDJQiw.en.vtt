00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 luke I am your father is well hi 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.719
 everyone knows how to treat today 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.889
 we find ourselves again the presentation 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.380
 of fashion and today I'm going to you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.450
 present the lightsaber mode or the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 find was fast so today 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.970
 I will introduce the mode to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 lightsaber that actually adds you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.430
 lightsabers and super 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.560
 powers 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.990
 so I'm going down right now 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.480
 besides, my pig died briefly 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.890
 go right away ash is fine 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 in my basement to show you a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 little bit of that and where the kraft then 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 how it looked good just 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 before he can make a lightsaber he 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.410
 you need crystals so crystals 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 of laser so no one could have you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.750
 can make a christ in blue green 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.100
 mauve or purple and red have for this 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 to do it's very simple just a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 diamond as well as god dyes sees the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 blue is lapis lazuli for glass 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.789
 it's the dye the end cactus does 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.270
 from glass cactus so there he 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.370
 takes the bad dye and there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 must god down the street of the ends and the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.430
 dye of rose then once you 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.049
 did all these crystals and well you 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.460
 will need to actually 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.930
 precisely the lightsaber by contract 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.130
 it's a little bit expensive because 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.770
 you as you can see it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.080
 you need obsidian so necessarily 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.369
 the crystal of the color that you 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.619
 want as well as 6 2 iron and a glass 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.450
 So here we are going to take the blue sword 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 to see me is very expensive 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.210
 after if they wanted to make a sword 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.100
 green it's the same except for the thousands 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.079
 you put a crystal glass 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 if you want to do a saab renault 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.130
 that's the same with a crystal 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 dead in the middle and for the red it's 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.549
 like it takes red and gold play b2 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.040
 takes sabers the jeanne 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.780
 that's when the lightsaber start to 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.030
 to present yourself well simply 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.780
 can see that there I go in the hand 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.759
 we do not see too much we do not see it too much 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.640
 but have to see I have a little trick in 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.530
 hands as soon as I do right click and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.320
 well you can see that the lightsaber 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.030
 opens good little flat is that there 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.619
 No noise this is a little bit 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.390
 pity I would have liked that is 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.619
 noise but good 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.180
 alico nothing is not serious it's the mode 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.170
 it's the developer who chooses who 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.440
 choose and its mode 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.700
 short so it does not add that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.959
 lightsabers as I told you that ai 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.760
 I also have super powers 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 sorry we can jump now from 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.540
 four cubes of water this point is done 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.580
 that when you have the lightsaber in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.260
 hand we will see if I do not have the sword 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.560
 laser it's nothing like it when it 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.840
 is off 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.209
 so if I would take me I can jump 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.739
 it's the same I jump and when I fall 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 you can see that it does not do any damage 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.269
 while if I jump and I 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.900
 take out hands that makes me fat 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:49.000
 damage I do not jump but he wants more 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.000
 high is great 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 Jesus of people in video 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.780
 maybe because we still need a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.660
 little game good life meanwhile i'm going 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.000
 show you a little bit the others 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.160
 so here you go 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.520
 ii be seen in 2.4 cubic it is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.290
 not bad when we jump from high 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.540
 here you see also a 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.860
 functionality also is to hover 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.690
 in the air like the real jedi 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.010
 here you see I can hover I can 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.010
 go directly harvested my wheat 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.380
 you see when comes out of the water it's 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.020
 magnificent 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.790
 there are fish there are also 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.760
 good the brutal fall if you find that 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.420
 we go down too slowly 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.410
 here after there is also a new 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.420
 functionality is that we can 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.970
 cling to any parent see 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.190
 keeping the shift key 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.650
 I passed you keys you see 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.640
 we press shift and we can 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:55.960
 to grab any parish on 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.700
 It's a little complicated here it is necessary 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.370
 not let go before it's actually 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.540
 on the la I saw we fall 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.580
 So here is the release of the advanced key 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.990
 and then we can move to the side 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.770
 etc. 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.260
 also I forgot to tell you for 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.360
 hovering cf you press f you hover 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.170
 for the brutal fall cr you press 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.980
 on rfi the brutal and that's so I'm going 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.840
 also a little bit of showing you that 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.350
 when you type a mob 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.020
 so I'm going to kill that pig waiting on 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.070
 will hover to build zombie we will 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.130
 kill we can see it's sabers are 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.070
 not super powerful like that that's it 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.840
 not super super shit is good even though 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.130
 it's expensive it's true that finally 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.810
 listened to resources 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.850
 it is true that the author could have 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.350
 make the most powerful and after that 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.510
 maybe it depends on the sword it seems to me 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.680
 that the red sand during you you go 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.610
 not come to bother us 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.590
 sorry 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.419
 i can not disabled super ccba that's it 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.919
 thrown over sorry it seems to me that the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.490
 red sword and the most powerful of 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.020
 swords from what I read and even this 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.120
 that I heard because I watched the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:10.180
 little videos before so we go 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.099
 see them then there they between them 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.719
 shots with red sand with saber 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:18.669
 Blues also cost the Sahb setback 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:21.430
 the cozy bah no actually it's just the 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.639
 zombie who is a young resistant I 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.169
 am level 40 loses so well ben lo 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.969
 that's pretty much all for this mode so 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.250
 we saw that the swords are a little are 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.529
 all equal to levels at the level of 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.789
 damage whose fight I was wrong 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:39.340
 I have seen bad brief anyway here you are 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.889
 could you have seen a little what 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.350
 how to make the mode a little bit in play 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.150
 these features that's how 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.800
 start did a little bit in game I 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.510
 always find the french fries 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000
 I find it always more friendly 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.440
 to see a video to see a little 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.430
 how the mode is presented 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.900
 how does it come into play 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.320
 I find it always more interesting 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.950
 and then and so here is not on his 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.390
 superpowers of the mentally ill 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.280
 here we go when I go to makro 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:14.150
 wall horses and I tell you bye all the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:17.790
 world carry you well and I will go 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:21.240
 here you go well and see you next time 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.640
 video lease and that force be with 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.970
 you were not good 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.970
 Hi
