00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.579
 mastered which one did a voice 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.929

 although you always have to know how it is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.660
 jose castro the voice of so much to capture microfonito 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 this superhero assuming that the spokesperson 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.450
 turnip the air 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.020
 it's sad that it's going to clarify when the recording is a good recording wolf 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.030
 the most important, so I follow and compress 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.210
 enough would be the word 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.560
 buy a pretty 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.530
 and in which they are simply to have a little 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.740
 the serious 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.060
 i and the rest this 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.220
 after exploding like this I will hararÃ© but always taking into account that after 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.590
 listen to him the English singer a little bit our ears 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.920
 in that scenario, sense is a somewhat subjective question to answer with 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.670
 words 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.740
 but now there is that the reaper the basics that he would have to exercise on occasions of 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.149
 they use says because many intel then a shock the xerez next to 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.460
 this 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850
 and many to likes with the coach we will be limiting the 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.530
 science percent and also counts the distance before the charm of 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.010
 the microphone singer 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.260

 I know 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.600
 two microphones 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.100
 the pts many tests like the microphones to know what is the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.400
 project will remain 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.170
