 between Russia and Kazakhstan and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.930
 Byelorussia 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.679
 if kazakhstan in this association will be 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.109
 get caught up then the country will come out immediately 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.310
 repeat during the vice premier briefing 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 bakhytzhan sagintayev moreover he

 denied rumors about creating a single currency 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.080
 between three countries 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.760
 I do not know where these conversations come back 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.059
 discussed and go to the mountain is not at all 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 there were no single currency tags 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.050
 we still have thank you many politicians 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.180
 our say yes what is eurasian it 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 union this purely economic union but 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.420
 this is purely pure livestock politics 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.640
 Rakhimzhanov sure Kazakhstan lost in 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.379
 this union without even joining it already on 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.600
 level of negotiation a single economic 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.220
 union is the last hope for something 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 Nazarbayev and his relatives 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.579
 save your wealth after leaving with 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.670
 presidency 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.580
 after retirement need 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.159
 which Nazarbayev need any guarantees 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.560
 further existence yes with such 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.710
 big huge material 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.119
 resources for him and his family 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.250
 if kazakhstan if it technically merges to 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.530
 Kazakhstan this Eurasian Union that we 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.420
 we are already seeing him Russia 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.020
 possible some guarantees provided 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.080
 on this account 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.360
 he and now the communist nurlan orabbayev 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.160
 who seems to be happy for 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.990
 new associations actually 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.910
 reconstruct and the Soviet Union 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.770
 on the contrary anxious bells 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.840
 says that kazakhstan with a tiny 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.880
 population and poor economy not 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.819
 competitor even Belarus not to mention 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.399
 Russia with mine so there are others 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.429
 contracts anus and we live very 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.659
 our friendly neighborly country but 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.520
 not necessary to give 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.530
 euro and already union why because although 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.939
 would be elementary 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.819
 17 million who are now 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.860

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:15.290
 the market is actually all the way around 17 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.890
 dissolve and i will most likely say 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.470
 short 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.780
 when hsom lose sovereignty between 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.799
 topics for legal registration 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.049
 economic union left a little 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.940
 more than a month at the end of April Lukashenko 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.900
 Putin and Nazarbayev will discuss the last 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.879
 nuances and in Minsk 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.010
