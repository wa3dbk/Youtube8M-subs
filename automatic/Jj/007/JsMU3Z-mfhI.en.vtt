00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.450
 what perks guys your maximum and good 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.450
 to that minus ruvd and we play 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.910
 hungry games and this is true 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.910
 this is cool comfortable games this is such 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.789
 online server where many centuries 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.730
 dock and the main task of the player 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.740
 become the last hero and we will try 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 get up by your hero and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 well it's not very easy and now through 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 few seconds we have to run to these 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.899
 the chests so we'll see and run 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.300
 that’s how my god lied 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.110
 I don't have time 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 what you specifically told me 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 she is in my opinion not very helpful to me 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.780
 so ok anyway we left without 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:02.100
 there is almost nothing to look for boxes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.350
 and in boxes there should be a lot of useful 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 things but not very useful 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.330
 therefore I look for their principle here like me and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.200
 spoke blocks 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.399
 it did not say that blogs 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.969
 I cannot therefore go where the eyes of the boat 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.450
 I hope I at least stretch 10 minutes and 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.549
 I will be all right 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.229
 because I already write down I do not know what 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:33.789
 then probably 10 11 just can not 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.360
 say look here can eat something that 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.530
 written so that's for sure language bowls 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.390
 I can even say watermelons 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:51.130
 To go nuts just than watermelons break what 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:57.700
 and it’s possible to have a cool watermelon and 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:02.530
 thank them yourself just a class and yes let's 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.979
 already the fact that tomorrow is the content so everything 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.429
 well although not yet let's install 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.430
 her 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:15.910
 everybody go on a journey so well I don’t 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.810
 would hurt know sword yes indeed 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 would not hurt a sword any sword at least 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.510
 wooden it was later even not bad 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 so now let's see what it is 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 see the air yes there are fish and arrows 1 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.969
 and die 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.950
 about zashib we found already 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:42.200
 iron sword and so we can go 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.909
 dock with others 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.939
 okay I will not run him to waste my 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:53.040
 hunger and maybe something else along the way 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:55.200
 well we found your iron sword 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.579
 it's cool in this game to find such 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.329
 this stuff has already been taken chest so here 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.870
 no, you can again go back to slept well and 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:10.340
 I think a lot of people though I know 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:21.650
 I did not interfere even armor yes thanks by the way 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:21.650
 so let's see no have already taken 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.970
 probably back to slept well and we will 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.040
 look further oh by the way that's interesting 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.010
 so wait now there is nothing there 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
 and here is an interesting building, let me im 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.919
 I will kill this eccentric 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.510

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.729

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:47.099
 and you know nothing about it to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.800

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:32.600

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.960
 Arbuzikov way saw a chest there

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.729

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.680
 Yes , few people left on this 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:55.669

 such a golden pants class I do n't know 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.910
 in my opinion better than skins so we 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:14.729
 make golden hands 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.240
 where do i have to go 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.240

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.289
