00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.720 

some<00:00:09.410> of<00:00:09.500> it<00:00:09.620> maybe<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:10.040> fact<00:00:10.219> that<00:00:10.340> they<00:00:10.549> are

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
some of it maybe the fact that they are

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.760 
some of it maybe the fact that they are
tend<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:11.389> be<00:00:11.450> non-traditional<00:00:11.809> students<00:00:12.530> and

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
tend to be non-traditional students and

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.650 
tend to be non-traditional students and
so<00:00:13.250> they're<00:00:13.520> a<00:00:13.549> little<00:00:13.790> bit<00:00:13.910> older<00:00:14.450> more

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
so they're a little bit older more

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.960 
so they're a little bit older more
mature<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:15.980> they're<00:00:16.520> a<00:00:16.550> little<00:00:16.820> bit

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
mature and so they're a little bit

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.420 
mature and so they're a little bit
hungrier<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:17.660> more<00:00:17.840> interested<00:00:18.470> in<00:00:18.590> learning

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
hungrier and more interested in learning

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.190 
hungrier and more interested in learning
and<00:00:19.700> getting<00:00:20.000> their<00:00:20.119> foot<00:00:20.300> in<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.509> door<00:00:20.630> and<00:00:20.930> I

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
and getting their foot in the door and I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.359 
and getting their foot in the door and I
think<00:00:21.380> that<00:00:21.470> really<00:00:21.650> helps<00:00:21.919> them<00:00:22.009> but<00:00:22.189> the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
think that really helps them but the

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.519 
think that really helps them but the
demand<00:00:22.640> for<00:00:22.730> IT<00:00:23.000> professionals<00:00:23.150> is<00:00:23.900> huge<00:00:24.320> you

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
demand for IT professionals is huge you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.679 
demand for IT professionals is huge you
know<00:00:24.560> over<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.430> over<00:00:25.609> again<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.300> one<00:00:26.570> of

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
know over and over again that is one of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.250 
know over and over again that is one of
the<00:00:26.779> most<00:00:26.990> sought<00:00:27.199> after<00:00:28.689> fields<00:00:29.689> one<00:00:30.140> of<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
the most sought after fields one of the

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.839 
the most sought after fields one of the
fields<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.650> we<00:00:30.980> have<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.400> least<00:00:31.580> amount<00:00:31.699> of

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
fields that we have the least amount of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:46.459 
fields that we have the least amount of
people<00:00:32.000> that<00:00:32.180> we<00:00:32.390> need<00:00:32.510> more<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.750> more<00:00:32.930> people

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.049 

going<00:00:47.469> to<00:00:47.559> Columbus<00:00:47.860> state<00:00:48.039> prepared<00:00:48.940> me<00:00:49.030> for

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
going to Columbus state prepared me for

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.590 
going to Columbus state prepared me for
that<00:00:49.329> experience<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.570> a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
that experience because it is a

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.060 
that experience because it is a
java-based<00:00:52.960> boot<00:00:53.290> camp<00:00:53.500> but<00:00:53.769> they<00:00:53.920> don't

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
java-based boot camp but they don't

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.630 
java-based boot camp but they don't
teach<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.320> Corrib<00:00:56.649> java<00:00:56.890> they<00:00:57.100> expect<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.550> to

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
teach the Corrib java they expect you to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.520 
teach the Corrib java they expect you to
know<00:00:57.789> that<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:58.660> I<00:00:58.690> couldn't<00:00:58.930> have<00:00:59.110> gotten<00:00:59.289> in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
know that so I couldn't have gotten in

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.600 
know that so I couldn't have gotten in
without<00:01:00.039> that<00:01:00.219> college<00:01:00.519> experience

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
without that college experience

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.490 
without that college experience
especially<00:01:01.149> with<00:01:01.420> Columbus<00:01:01.720> State<00:01:01.899> their

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
especially with Columbus State their

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.829 
especially with Columbus State their
emphasis<00:01:02.829> is<00:01:03.220> on<00:01:03.250> Java<00:01:03.579> well<00:01:04.089> especially<00:01:04.509> at

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
emphasis is on Java well especially at

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.770 
emphasis is on Java well especially at
Columbus<00:01:05.170> State<00:01:05.290> people<00:01:06.220> are<00:01:06.399> learning<00:01:06.729> very

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
Columbus State people are learning very

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.510 
Columbus State people are learning very
marketable<00:01:07.780> skills<00:01:08.320> they<00:01:09.040> learn<00:01:09.310> how<00:01:09.490> to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
marketable skills they learn how to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.830 
marketable skills they learn how to
program<00:01:09.820> in<00:01:10.119> Java<00:01:10.149> they<00:01:10.630> learn

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
program in Java they learn

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.990 
program in Java they learn
object-oriented<00:01:11.560> technology<00:01:12.280> there<00:01:12.549> they're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
object-oriented technology there they're

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.210 
object-oriented technology there they're
learning<00:01:13.210> those<00:01:13.570> things<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.350> employers<00:01:14.950> are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
learning those things that employers are

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.830 
learning those things that employers are
really<00:01:15.520> looking<00:01:15.640> for<00:01:16.180> for<00:01:16.420> them<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.690> actually

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
really looking for for them to actually

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.200 
really looking for for them to actually
hit<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> ground<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:18.009> do<00:01:18.520> work<00:01:18.700> for<00:01:18.910> a<00:01:18.970> client

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
hit the ground and do work for a client

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.499 
hit the ground and do work for a client
not<00:01:20.170> just<00:01:20.500> theoretical<00:01:20.920> knowledge<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:22.300> that's

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
not just theoretical knowledge so that's

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.060 
not just theoretical knowledge so that's
why<00:01:22.600> two<00:01:22.720> year<00:01:22.960> degree<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.320> really<00:01:23.679> important

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
why two year degree is really important

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190 
why two year degree is really important
so<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.789> table<00:01:25.090> states<00:01:25.390> are<00:01:25.690> they<00:01:25.869> have<00:01:26.050> to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
so the table states are they have to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.130 
so the table states are they have to
know<00:01:26.380> Java<00:01:26.890> or<00:01:27.720> auditorium<00:01:28.720> programming

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
know Java or auditorium programming

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.950 
know Java or auditorium programming
language<00:01:29.700> fundamentally<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.450> beyond

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
language fundamentally and then beyond

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.029 
language fundamentally and then beyond
that<00:01:32.110> we're<00:01:32.259> really<00:01:32.409> looking<00:01:32.740> for<00:01:32.890> what

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
that we're really looking for what

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.859 
that we're really looking for what
differentiates<00:01:33.610> them<00:01:33.789> whether<00:01:34.600> they<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.840> a

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869

differentiates them whether they have a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
passion in the field whether they really

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.070 
passion in the field whether they really
enjoy<00:01:38.530> programming<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.450> S<00:01:40.899> or

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
enjoy programming and the S or
