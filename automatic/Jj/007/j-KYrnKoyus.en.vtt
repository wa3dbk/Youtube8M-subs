play<00:04:00.659> simply<00:04:01.079> for<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.409> fact<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.799> I'm<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:02.310> at

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.219 
play simply for the fact that I'm not at
the<00:04:02.669> point<00:04:02.849> guard<00:04:03.000> spot<00:04:03.569> since<00:04:03.930> Russell

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
the point guard spot since Russell

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.719

Westbrook is back in the starting

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.969 
Westbrook is back in the starting
rotation<00:04:05.939> so<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.079> means<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.590> bit<00:04:07.769> more

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
rotation so that means a bit more
