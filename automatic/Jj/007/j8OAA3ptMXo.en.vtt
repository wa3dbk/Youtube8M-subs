00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.460
 improving what is already good is a challenge 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 to customize pain from what 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.330
 Do you think then of the whim given in this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.220
 300 I would make a difference in cars is a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.920
 millionaire business 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.250
 among the various adobe trends is a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.700
 The most expensive to get into this wave. 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:38.930
 the wheels should be large the heavy sound 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.930
 and the details of good taste 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.210
 games like this brings events and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.539
 all modified front edges 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.250
 look forward to the 24 vertical doors that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.000
 the engine vm 5.7 v8 and 350 horsepower 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 power 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.750
 now all this stopped a dream one 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.750
 a little 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840
 take advantage of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.600
 low presented as concept in the hall 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.290
 from new york 2003 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.410
 launched in 2004 the 300c of another action 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.380
 rear if engine hemi series is on 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.510
 actually an abbreviation of that right pmn 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.880
 is an engine technology the decade of 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.979
 50 is being taken over by industry 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.120
 hemispheric camera causes the burn 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.580
 of fuel 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.820
 she is more homogeneous taking advantage 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.030
 better the air-fuel mixture 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:48.880
 trading in kids much but much more 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:50.950
 I came back to a v8 engine has a technology 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.070
 especially when low 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.470
 speed and turns four of the eight 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.790
 cylinders to save fuel to 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.070
 from the moment I need more 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.110
 power that the ground floor in the accelerator 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.090
 it automatically connects others 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.520
 four cylinders and starts to run 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.520
 as a legitimate stop v8 in the difference 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.290
 the rate goes to give a fuck all 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.830
 in the second in addition to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.230
 spend 20% less gas and system 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.510
 turning off the cylinders reduces 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.430
 air pollution 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.940
 this citizen more than five meters 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.700
 also rescued a passion from the American 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.650
 the rear wheel drive a heavy car like 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.960
 it is imperative that he without the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.510
 rear wheel drive which will cause 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.420
 15 did better distributed among the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.150
 angels another vehicle with the past is the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.570
 the main source of inspiration 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.890
 is the famous 300 series made models 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.620
 between 1955 and 65 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.720
 the grid design reminds very original 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.450
 huh 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 but this 300 is customized in style 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.830
 since undergoing a transformation 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.560
 which lasted two months 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.900
 the style dame is a style that does not change 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.920
 the in-line features of the car 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.510
 huh 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.770
 but that add the wheels 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.410
 adding that the details of 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.019
 refinement in the vehicle for example this 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.459
 this front grille which is a grid in the 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.260
 style of nÃ© 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.930
 and also the front bumper that the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.320
 people changed to shopping openings 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.060
 more sports for him there is no drawing 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.000
 of the car you see that it accompanies the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.340
 car links completely 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.350
 original doors gave way to the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.350
 hours that open vertically 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.060
 on the inside few changes only one 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.700
 dvd screen found the body 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.110
 so it's just a peek at what happened 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.120
 with the trunk 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:09.040
 here we have three screens of 10 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:11.590
 inch widescreen 4 rose to 10 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.520
 inch and an amplifier of 1000 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.100
 two amplifiers watts and 600 watts 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.100
 every potential of that car in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.340
 around 1,400 places is in sounds that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.110
 respects the United States about 300 and is 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.930
 popular with staff who say that a 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.820
 car to customize scams that he is 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.670
 known as mini bentley by 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.860
 similar to the sedan in English around here 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.460
 and does not give a car difficult to see through 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.140
 streets 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.140
 even more so than once the damage
