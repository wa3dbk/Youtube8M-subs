00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.900
 efe moto my recipe 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.130
 The ingredients for this recipe are 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.050
 a cup of chocolate chips semi 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.230
 sweets 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.800
 two cups of thick cream to beat a 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.190
 quarter cup of icing sugar 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.110
 two teaspoons of vanilla extract 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.970
 and to serve I'm using raspberries 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.970
 fresh let's start 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.260
 in a pot boil over medium low heat 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.360
 cup of the whipping cream 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.430
 make sure the fire is very low 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680
 so that the cream does not stick or you get 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.090
 burn because if this happens it will give you a 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.090
 very bitter taste to your dessert 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.769
 as the cream starts to boil 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.030
 add the chocolate sparks 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.030
 Stirs a little and extinguishes the fire 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.980
 stir again the cream with the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.050
 chocolate sparks covers the pot with 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.850
 a cover and let stand for a couple 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.770
 of more minutes so that the sparks of 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.770
 chocolate melt completely 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.849
 since the chocolate sparks are 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.069
 completely melted the 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.579
 melted chocolate to a bowl size 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.430
 / medium and large lid it again and 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.409
 Allow to cool to room temperature in 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.239
 an electric mixer add the rest 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.920
 of the cream to beat and also add 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.920
 the icing sugar and the vanilla extract 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.420
 Beat at high speed for about 3 or 5 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.670
 minutes or until the cream is thick 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.920
 and fluffy you want me to get the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.070
 texture or cream consistency 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.070
 beaten 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.970
 since you have the desired consistency 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.890
 remove the bowl from the blender and now 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.260
 Take the melted chocolate and with a 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.020
 spatula adds on the chocolate a 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.240
 third of the whipped cream with 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.770
 gentle, circular movements try 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.069
 incorporate the whipped cream with the 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.349
 chocolate without over mixing 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.389
 since it is well incorporated again 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.879
 add a third more of the whipped cream 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.980
 about chocolate and again with 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.280
 smooth and circular movements mix 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.260
 the cream and the chocolate keeps repeating 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.689
 these steps until you have mixed 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.810
 all the whipped cream with the chocolate 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.810
 melted 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.549
 and that's all in these moments if I 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.040
 you want you can boil your dessert is already 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.530
 ready or if you like you can put it in a 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.540
 container or in a plastic bag and 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.980
 refrigerate it until you're ready to 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.569
 serve it 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.489
 I'm going to fill a pastry bag with 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.650
 the chocolate mousse and I'll serve it 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.239
 in a small bowl 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.040
 I'm going to decorate it with a little 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.860
 fresh raspberries and a little bit of 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.160
 grated chocolate and that's all good 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.160
 advantage 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.680
