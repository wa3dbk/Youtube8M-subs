 once again and tutorials is sport and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:35.970
 learn 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.970
 it's obvious this is going there 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.310
 but how do we do it more than 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.309
 To learn this maneuver made voices 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.130
 That you learn the eye I came to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:01:01.050
 I can hit this new one to catch my eye. 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:01:01.050
 purple roddick follows the team stage 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.410
 beauty how this help exchange is well 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.070
 simple remembers a little time of the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.350
 end 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.990
 only that the difference is that even in our 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.420
 walk from the front and stay here where people 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.300
 You can do behind a skit that 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.619
 so we will have to play 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.080
 front right 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.560
 Then you can bring him some eye. 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.430
 Sure, and we're going to hit the heel. 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.410
 forward 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.540
 so now because we raise the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.350
 Look, people look right up there, pulling 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.100
 the skate completing a lap around 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 himself 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.549
 This is here, and it 's not hitting our 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.190
 then the motion is instead of the flip 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.950
 We usually do it here, right? 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.590
 we will do as the defendant on this basis 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.840
 here knows the back foot it will stay 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.909
 at about the tip of the right to skate 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.619
 people will hit the eye and we will pull the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.970
 heel forward is not the fault of this 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.060
 shape beating it 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.710
 ok here again when we hit 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 Our time ahead, we'll go 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 have a glass ballerina little foot that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.170
 the ballet- foot of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.170
 dancers who will teach the rock 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 and go forward 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 Ok, that's it, we 'll show you around. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.310
 practice now how it is 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:03:08.200

00:02:42.930 --> 00:03:11.200
