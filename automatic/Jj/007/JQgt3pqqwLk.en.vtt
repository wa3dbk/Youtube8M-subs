whatever you want to do to reach those
goals<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.790> ok<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> reward<00:01:54.689> yourself<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
goals and it's ok to reward yourself I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.440 
goals and it's ok to reward yourself I
think<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> should<00:01:55.890> reward<00:01:56.460> yourself<00:01:56.700> um

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
think that you should reward yourself um

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.149 
think that you should reward yourself um
so<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.469> start<00:01:58.710> hitting<00:01:59.009> those

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so when you do start hitting those

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
so when you do start hitting those
little<00:01:59.520> goals<00:01:59.790> give<00:02:00.479> yourself<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> reward<00:02:01.290> for

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
little goals give yourself a reward for

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.859 
little goals give yourself a reward for
every<00:02:02.399> time<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.820> reach<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> those<00:02:03.630> goals

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
every time you reach one of those goals

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
every time you reach one of those goals
