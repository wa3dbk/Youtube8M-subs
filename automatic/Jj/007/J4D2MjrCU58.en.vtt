and the iphone it is plausible

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.740 
and the iphone it is plausible
considering<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.699> usually<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.390> ipod

event<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.289> September<00:01:01.920> however<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.730> probably

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
event in September however this probably

event in September however this probably
won't<00:01:03.539> happen<00:01:03.870> considering<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.860> fact<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
won't happen considering the fact that
