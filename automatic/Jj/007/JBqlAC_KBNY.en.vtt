00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.040
I don’t need a frail clone that won’t last through eternity

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.020
The justice I held may not exist anymore

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.380
Why did you cry for me?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.080
Why did you believe me… There was no hesitation in your eyes

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.340
I grabbed your cold hand

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.680
“Together” I promised you, white princess

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:00.580
Shine, True Administrator, you’ll be a fiction, sleeping Miko

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.600
You’ll live wearing thorns of fleeting sins

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.100
You’ll wake up again once the era you yearn for will come

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:26.760
Kill the roots of death, follow your path

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.380
In this play shaking desires soar in this miniature garden, too loud

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.300
This pitch black karma passed its judgment on me

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.860
The close death, blinded by this spell

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.480
Even breathing became painful… Your smiling hurts

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.080
I gently kissed the eyelids of the sleeping princess

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.740
“Farewell… See you”

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.960
Descend, True Administrator, open that ancient door

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.660
The childish person next to you won’t change

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.600
The cause of everything, my own thoughts, are all within my hand

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.660
From impending dreams, a voice awakens

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:19.300
The truth is, within my lonely journey, my own decisions scare me

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.040
You embraced my trembling body

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.040
Shine, True Administrator, shoot me and seek peace

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:47.120
The path of Miko, the one who became a living legend
