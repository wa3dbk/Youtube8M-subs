GS<00:00:30.090> very<00:00:30.359> complex<00:00:30.810> basically<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> situation

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
GS very complex basically the situation

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.910 
GS very complex basically the situation
is<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> rule<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> matter<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
is there is a rule and as a matter of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
is there is a rule and as a matter of
fact<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.460> must<00:00:35.850> say<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> rule<00:00:36.360> should<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.079> be

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
fact I must say the rule should not be

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470 
fact I must say the rule should not be
there<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.620> speed<00:00:38.340> should<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:38.940> consoled

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there because speed should be consoled

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.590 
there because speed should be consoled
by<00:00:39.600> track<00:00:40.050> design<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> entry<00:00:41.160> speed<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.940> then

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
by track design and entry speed but then

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.650 
by track design and entry speed but then
the<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.280> gets<00:00:44.520> tough<00:00:44.730> because

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the really the going gets tough because

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.619 
the really the going gets tough because
in<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> point<00:00:46.620> 1<00:00:46.860> he<00:00:47.250> only<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:48.059> trying<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
in the point 1 he only was trying to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
in the point 1 he only was trying to
find<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.379> fly<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.800> fast<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.250> possible<00:00:50.489> together

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
find to fly as fast as possible together

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.290 
find to fly as fast as possible together
one<00:00:51.210> point<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.079> he<00:00:52.620> made<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> mistake<00:00:53.039> no<00:00:53.940> point

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
one point but he made a mistake no point

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.439 
one point but he made a mistake no point
at<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.110> basically<00:00:55.890> meant<00:00:56.850> there's

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
at all and that basically meant there's

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
at all and that basically meant there's
no<00:00:57.750> chance<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> world<00:00:58.739> championship
