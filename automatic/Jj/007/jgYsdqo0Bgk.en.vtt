00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:13.339 

just<00:01:55.270> remember

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.740 

when<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.660> come<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.900> corner<00:04:07.650> make<00:04:07.860> sure

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:32.930 

you<00:04:12.290> can<00:04:12.500> also<00:04:12.680> use<00:04:13.870> smallest<00:04:15.700> stitch

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.140 

also<00:04:33.900> make<00:04:34.440> sure<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.740> seam<00:04:35.580> allowances

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
also make sure that seam allowances

00:04:36.150 --> 00:05:14.940 
also make sure that seam allowances
don't

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.220 

next<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.820> trim<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.390> seam<00:05:16.600> allowance<00:05:17.170> and

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:47.980 

the<00:05:21.680> fabric<00:05:22.070> is<00:05:22.220> gonna<00:05:22.430> be<00:05:22.610> turned

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:06:54.810 

then<00:05:48.560> we'll<00:05:48.800> stitch

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:13.110 

again<00:06:55.480> push<00:06:56.170> the<00:06:56.380> seam<00:06:56.620> allowance<00:06:57.160> towards

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:21.700 

just<00:07:13.750> something<00:07:14.080> you<00:07:14.110> probably<00:07:14.380> see

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:33.530 

waste

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.960 

now<00:07:33.750> go<00:07:34.050> an<00:07:34.170> iron<00:07:34.560> and<00:07:35.040> we're<00:07:35.340> ready<00:07:35.610> for<00:07:35.880> the
