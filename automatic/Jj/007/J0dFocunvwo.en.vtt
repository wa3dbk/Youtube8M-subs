00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
have a nice little video today it was

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.570 
have a nice little video today it was
really<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.500> talking<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.070> benefits

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
really just talking about the benefits

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.810 
really just talking about the benefits
of<00:00:14.730> having<00:00:15.240> an<00:00:15.599> EVF<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> camera<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.670> has<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
of having an EVF on a camera that has a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760 
of having an EVF on a camera that has a
long<00:00:18.119> zoom<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.109> what's<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.410> EVF

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
long zoom like this one what's an EVF

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.240 
long zoom like this one what's an EVF
Billy

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
Billy

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640 
Billy
it's<00:00:20.400> basically<00:00:20.760> an<00:00:21.330> LCD<00:00:21.689> screen<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.320> smaller

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it's basically an LCD screen but smaller

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
it's basically an LCD screen but smaller
for<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:23.039> eyes<00:00:23.189> or<00:00:23.699> an<00:00:23.880> electronic

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
for your eyes or an electronic

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.480 
for your eyes or an electronic
viewfinder<00:00:24.810> yeah<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.769> everyone<00:00:26.010> knows<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
viewfinder yeah so everyone knows that

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.480 
viewfinder yeah so everyone knows that
the<00:00:26.609> cameras<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.119> LCD<00:00:27.570> screens<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> back

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
the cameras have LCD screens on the back

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.710 
the cameras have LCD screens on the back
the<00:00:29.490> cameras<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> also<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.539> little

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the cameras that also have this little

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
the cameras that also have this little
eye<00:00:30.960> hole<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.560> typically<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.850> an

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
eye hole here typically I have an

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.930 
eye hole here typically I have an
electronic<00:00:33.630> viewfinder<00:00:34.430> really<00:00:35.430> there's<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
electronic viewfinder really there's a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.030 
electronic viewfinder really there's a
four<00:00:36.420> key<00:00:36.750> benefits<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.380> want<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> cover<00:00:37.800> off

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
four key benefits we want to cover off

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
four key benefits we want to cover off
here<00:00:38.370> Billy<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.969> each<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.270> them<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.809> really

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
here Billy and each of them are really

here Billy and each of them are really
really<00:00:41.160> true<00:00:41.489> benefits<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:42.540> you're

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
really true benefits so if you're

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
really true benefits so if you're
thinking<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> buying<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.800> camera<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> long

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
thinking of buying a camera with a long

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
thinking of buying a camera with a long
zoom<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.989> please<00:00:46.289> carefully<00:00:46.649> listen

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
zoom like this please carefully listen

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
zoom like this please carefully listen
to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> benefits<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.210> having<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.629> camera<00:00:49.020> with

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
to the benefits of having a camera with

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.459 
to the benefits of having a camera with
an<00:00:49.680> EVF<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> choose<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.360> EVF<00:00:51.780> okay

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
an EVF and choose one with an EVF okay

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
an EVF and choose one with an EVF okay
so<00:00:52.530> number<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.010> benefit<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.789> number<00:00:53.969> one

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so number one benefit my number one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.880 
so number one benefit my number one
benefit<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.539> actually<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> way<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.410> hold<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
benefit is actually the way you hold the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.979 
benefit is actually the way you hold the
camera<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> style<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> camera

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
camera now this style of camera

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.180 
camera now this style of camera
obviously<00:00:58.320> allows<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> better

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
obviously allows you to have a better

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
obviously allows you to have a better
grip<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.030> without<00:01:00.359> electronic<00:01:00.899> viewfinder

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
grip but without electronic viewfinder

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
grip but without electronic viewfinder
you<00:01:01.469> end<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.739> taking<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> picture<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.489> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you end up taking a picture like this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.450 
you end up taking a picture like this
well<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> electronic<00:01:04.470> viewfinder<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
well with the electronic viewfinder it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
well with the electronic viewfinder it's
up<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:05.970> eye<00:01:06.090> level<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.930> elbows<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.470> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
up to your eye level your elbows are in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.530 
up to your eye level your elbows are in
and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.280> end<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.549> becoming<00:01:08.700> sort<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.240> human

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and you end up becoming sort of a human

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.719 
and you end up becoming sort of a human
tripod<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:10.770> take<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> vase<00:01:11.400> steady

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
tripod you actually take a vase steady

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.850 
tripod you actually take a vase steady
shot<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:12.810> imperative<00:01:13.170> imperative

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
shot and it's very imperative imperative

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
shot and it's very imperative imperative
that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.430> these<00:01:14.939> camera<00:01:15.360> have

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that you do because these camera have

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
that you do because these camera have
has<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.380> long<00:01:16.590> zoom<00:01:16.860> range<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
has very long zoom range right and the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.660 
has very long zoom range right and the
longer<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.369> add

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
longer they are the more you can can add

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.490 
longer they are the more you can can add
shake<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.540> by<00:01:21.630> having<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> better

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
shake to it and by having that better

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.859 
shake to it and by having that better
stability<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:24.150> doubling<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
stability it's actually doubling up on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
stability it's actually doubling up on
even<00:01:25.710> cameras<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.310> built-in<00:01:26.729> image

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
even cameras that have built-in image

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
even cameras that have built-in image
stabilized<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.080> image<00:01:28.439> stabilization

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
stabilized right so image stabilization

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
stabilized right so image stabilization
whether<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.850> optical<00:01:30.600> digital<00:01:30.780> image

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
whether it's optical digital image

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
whether it's optical digital image
stabilization<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.100> human<00:01:33.060> image

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
stabilization is one human image

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
stabilization is one human image
stabilization<00:01:33.810> H<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.799> as

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
stabilization H is is really just as

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
stabilization H is is really just as
effective<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> difference<00:01:39.119> between<00:01:39.299> holding

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
effective the difference between holding

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
effective the difference between holding
a<00:01:39.689> camera<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.890> taking<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> picture

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a camera like this and taking a picture

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.389 
a camera like this and taking a picture
with<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> long<00:01:41.909> zoom<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
with a long zoom and like this is the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.990 
with a long zoom and like this is the
equivalent<00:01:45.920> techniques<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.130> leaning<00:01:47.460> onto

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.149 

what<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.210> while<00:01:51.659> using<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.530> why

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
what are you while using that so why

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
what are you while using that so why
fire<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.149> number<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.600> what's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
fire I think that's number one what's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.060 
fire I think that's number one what's
our<00:01:54.899> number<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.290> benefit<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.829> think<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
our number two benefit I think the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.469 
our number two benefit I think the
number<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.430> benefit<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> ability<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
number two benefit is the ability to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.139 
number two benefit is the ability to
actually<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.829> images<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.909> bright

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
actually see the images on a bright

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
actually see the images on a bright

you end up shooting outdoors a lot

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
you end up shooting outdoors a lot
especially<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.799> sports<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> whatnot<00:02:05.490> and

customers and having that EVF I think

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.170 
customers and having that EVF I think
it's<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.900> key<00:02:22.140> feature<00:02:22.409> yeah<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.610> know<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.939> a

it's a key feature yeah you know and a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.580 
it's a key feature yeah you know and a
must<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.689> this<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:25.079> you<00:02:25.230> yeah<00:02:25.379> depending

pictures the sun's reflecting off in

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
pictures the sun's reflecting off in
different<00:02:29.519> ways<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.000> always<00:02:30.299> different<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
different ways it's always different the

different ways it's always different the
technologies<00:02:31.470> improve<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.129> nothing<00:02:32.909> beats

trying<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.019> compose<00:02:34.349> your<00:02:34.379> picture<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.159> bright

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
trying to compose your picture in bright

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.920 
trying to compose your picture in bright
sunlight<00:02:36.060> by<00:02:36.420> looking<00:02:36.780> through<00:02:36.900> an<00:02:37.049> EVF<00:02:38.930> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
sunlight by looking through an EVF you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.050 
sunlight by looking through an EVF you
can<00:02:40.079> also<00:02:40.230> see<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> exposure<00:02:43.609> and<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.700> focus

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
can also see the exposure and the focus

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.690 
can also see the exposure and the focus
locking<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.629> so<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.739> good<00:02:47.040> taking<00:02:47.370> pictures

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
locking in so very good taking pictures

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.399 
locking in so very good taking pictures
in<00:02:47.849> bright<00:02:48.030> sunlight<00:02:48.359> gives<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.989> much<00:02:49.230> better

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
in bright sunlight gives you much better

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.500 
in bright sunlight gives you much better
now<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.010> third<00:02:50.489> ones<00:02:50.760> kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.269> same

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
now the third ones kind of the same

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.390 
now the third ones kind of the same
thing<00:02:51.840> but<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.139> Reverse<00:02:52.500> right<00:02:52.680> yes<00:02:53.069> because

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
thing but in Reverse right yes because

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.369 
thing but in Reverse right yes because
you<00:02:53.579> know<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.819> EVF<00:02:54.239> acts<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.810> an<00:02:54.930> LCD<00:02:55.260> screen

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
you know the EVF acts like an LCD screen

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.430 
you know the EVF acts like an LCD screen
anything<00:02:56.159> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.849> do<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.150> an<00:02:57.269> LCD<00:02:57.420> screen<00:02:57.690> you

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
anything you can do on an LCD screen you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.140 
anything you can do on an LCD screen you
can<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.889> EVF<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.519> well<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.909> all<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
can do on the EVF as well so all the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.089 
can do on the EVF as well so all the
shooting<00:03:00.450> information<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.709> course<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
shooting information and of course the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.949 
shooting information and of course the
playback<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.909> ability<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.269> actually<00:03:03.540> do

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
playback and the ability to actually do

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.839 
playback and the ability to actually do
the<00:03:04.109> images<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.709> lot<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.040> times<00:03:05.220> when<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.579> share

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
the images a lot of times when you share

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.430 
the images a lot of times when you share
the<00:03:05.970> image<00:03:06.180> outdoors<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.109> show<00:03:07.409> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the image outdoors and you show to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.289 
the image outdoors and you show to
someone<00:03:07.799> there's<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.129> lot<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.400> get<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.819> glare<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
someone there's a lot of get a glare and

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.910 
someone there's a lot of get a glare and
it's<00:03:09.690> really<00:03:09.930> difficult<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.470> actually<00:03:10.500> show

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
it's really difficult to actually show

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.589 
it's really difficult to actually show
your<00:03:11.099> buddies<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.670> shots<00:03:11.909> you've<00:03:12.120> taken<00:03:12.299> and

you know anything personally for you if
you<00:03:14.549> want<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> check<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.269> exposure<00:03:15.720> zoom<00:03:16.470> in

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
you want to check the exposure zoom in

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
you want to check the exposure zoom in
on<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:16.949> exposure<00:03:17.400> or<00:03:17.940> zoom<00:03:18.209> in<00:03:18.329> on<00:03:18.419> that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
on that exposure or zoom in on that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.939 
on that exposure or zoom in on that
subject<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.019> make<00:03:19.169> sure<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.470> doing<00:03:19.709> focus

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
subject to make sure that doing focus

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.129 
subject to make sure that doing focus
it's<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.669> lot<00:03:20.849> easier<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.389> do<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:21.810> with<00:03:22.019> the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
it's a lot easier to do that with the

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.250 
it's a lot easier to do that with the
EVF<00:03:22.669> absolutely<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.910> I'll<00:03:24.720> tell<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.079> one

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
EVF absolutely and I'll tell you one

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.599 
EVF absolutely and I'll tell you one
thing<00:03:25.290> for<00:03:25.769> people<00:03:26.069> who<00:03:26.129> wear<00:03:26.310> reading

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
thing for people who wear reading

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.330

this distance is sometimes very
difficult<00:03:33.959> when<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.470> look<00:03:34.650> at<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.859> EVF<00:03:35.340> it's

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
difficult when you look at the EVF it's

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.490 
difficult when you look at the EVF it's
much<00:03:35.760> easier<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.299> see<00:03:36.599> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> playback<00:03:37.230> mode

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
much easier to see in the playback mode

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.970 
much easier to see in the playback mode
I<00:03:38.209> can<00:03:39.209> speak<00:03:39.599> from<00:03:39.780> experience<00:03:39.900> there<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
I can speak from experience there and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.659 
I can speak from experience there and
number<00:03:41.579> four<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:41.879> as<00:03:42.359> basic<00:03:42.840> simple<00:03:43.620> fact<00:03:44.430> is

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
number four is as basic simple fact is

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.289 
number four is as basic simple fact is
that<00:03:44.940> when<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.329> use<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.750> EVF<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.940> compose<00:03:47.940> and

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
that when you use the EVF to compose and

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.150 
that when you use the EVF to compose and
shoot<00:03:48.540> your<00:03:48.660> pictures<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.379> also<00:03:49.560> use<00:03:49.949> it<00:03:49.980> for

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
shoot your pictures and also use it for

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.729 
shoot your pictures and also use it for
playback<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.419> virtually<00:03:51.750> extend<00:03:52.500> your

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
playback you virtually extend your

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.759 
playback you virtually extend your
battery<00:03:52.949> power<00:03:53.430> by<00:03:53.819> double<00:03:54.269> absolutely<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.500> I

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
battery power by double absolutely and I

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.830 
battery power by double absolutely and I
you<00:03:56.220> know<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:56.760> LCD<00:03:57.150> screens<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.659> lot

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
you know what the LCD screens a lot

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.509 
you know what the LCD screens a lot
brighter<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.889> I<00:03:58.919> should<00:03:59.220> have<00:03:59.340> more

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
brighter the that I should have more

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.339 
brighter the that I should have more
color<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.970> them<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.359> because<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:00.959> all<00:04:01.169> that

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
color in them and because of all that

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.680 
color in them and because of all that
that<00:04:01.379> that<00:04:02.010> special<00:04:02.459> add-on<00:04:02.909> you<00:04:03.329> end<00:04:03.540> up

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
that that special add-on you end up

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.020 
that that special add-on you end up
consuming<00:04:04.169> more<00:04:04.709> battery<00:04:05.099> life<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:05.699> using

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
consuming more battery life and so using

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.119 
consuming more battery life and so using
the<00:04:06.090> EVF<00:04:06.480> actually<00:04:06.870> reduces<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.739> battery

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
the EVF actually reduces the battery

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.550 
the EVF actually reduces the battery
life<00:04:08.310> by<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.849> almost<00:04:09.510> doubling<00:04:09.900> by<00:04:10.199> doubling

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
life by and almost doubling by doubling

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.159 
life by and almost doubling by doubling
