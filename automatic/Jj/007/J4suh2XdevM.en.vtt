00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hi, I'm Jorge MorÃ³n and well, I bring you 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.990
 here a call of duty ghosts kit 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.960
 multiplayer 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.599
 it means that I already have the expensive 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.760
 not the multiplayer and why are you 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.860
 watching this multiplayer video of 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.779
 critics because it's not mine is from another 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.910
 person but who brought it so that 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.710
 observe jce I already know that there are many channels 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.140
 that they have it in multiple and pop so that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.769
 Observe the differences with another game 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.960
 first the graphics have increased 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.910
 after the scores even though 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.089
 it seems more to the modes before the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.089
 skinny 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.820
 until there are multiple multiple 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.820
 Well I will not be able to play multiplayer 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.480
 and I had observed a few 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:58.129
 differences 1 in which I said I 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:02.440
 before and also the aiming is much 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.440
 easier moves less worth 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.460
 now to point us with the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.520
 Sniper now if you mean to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.240
 to track now or suffer the possible is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.369
 a little harder because you see less 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.340
 people in exchange there will be no costs 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.680
 as they were all as more enlightened then 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:28.550
 it looked better this one not this one sees the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.960
 people a little more darker 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.850
 so it's about this a similar 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.260
 to wolffer mode that did not distinguish very 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.220
 good to people 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.400
 Well, I leave you with this video that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.670
 was going to do a gameplay or the bluff but 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.070
 as I could not because I leave this and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.460
 until he has no cardio because he does not 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.680
 I could do more of these good he but 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.710
 I do not know, I think it's like a canine unit 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 or something similar but I do not know and something else 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.160
 is the headshot here can I shoot at the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.150
 head stays marked and indicates 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.150
 what did you do? 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.590
 and this was simply what I wanted 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.590
 tell 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.080
 a like help a favorite too 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.610
 comments about life also and about 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.770
 all a subscription more than anything 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.770
 it helped we're going to win a lot 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.900
 and everything was waiting for you 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.240
 I think I'm going to leave you with the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.580
 gameplay for you to see it you will have the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.680
 background as they speak in English ok but it's 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.109
 what is a 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:45.879
 Youtube in English is good as English or 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:45.879
 American I do not know if that's why I do not have 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.230
 and maps maps larger maps 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.000
 they are bigger every time I'm giving 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.140
 account that looks more like the batey 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.840
 filtres which was not much since 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.700
 it would be a kind of creation but good 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.260
 the blade here is much easier 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.260
 Too much faster 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.049
 in addition to the jumps observe pace 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.030
 you can do that in lhasa you sign up 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.129
 seriously what the goose is written 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.280
 you can make them to go announcing torrado 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.230
 behind English with signs to mind that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.530
 is what I like, it fills me with everything and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.360
 Well, I want to leave it 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.360
 I will leave watching this video 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.430
 that I really tell you that it helps me 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.010
 enough to help enough that you have 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.460
 a line up if you subscribe and comment 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.460
 especially 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.440
 and the death chamber here looks a lot 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.930
 better much better because it looks more 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.470
 broad 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.390
 and not like in the black ops 2 that looked 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.300
 hello for red all that takes away 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.170
 let's say that is better 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.170
 this 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.230
 Well, that's it, I think it's 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.459
 can also acquire camouflage we are going 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.870
 I do not know why I still do not have a 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.209
 multiplayer but I think so so 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.280
 good as we are finishing and I am going 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.260
 to say that light favorites again 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.880

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.570
 and I hope you liked it 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.810
 why 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.210
 it's an informative plus it's a gameplay 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.880
 Occasional an informative to indicate us 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.120
