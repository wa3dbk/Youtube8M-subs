00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello today breakfast again and 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 We try to make curd anything 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.789
 delicious, first you need to buy 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.830
 which one is desirable not bad 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 then tell you what it means well and 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.390
 do not interfere much do so much 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.860
 how much do we have curd 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 eat sour cream and eat milk this milk and 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.540
 a little sugar here despite the fact that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.200
 sour cream here it is upheld see 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.620
 Vodichkoy yes she in general the good 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.050
 sour cream but not homemade store and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.890
 Now I will say a few words 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.260
 dairy products including cottage cheese 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.180
 side of the problem guys are they him 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.659
 learned to make almost milk 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:15.210
 You know, that is, cottage cheese is essentially 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.920
 matter sour milk from which thrown back 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.350
 buttermilk 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:29.430
 or there and brother well, such serum is shorter 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 but they add more palm 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.409
 oil or something like that i'm here 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.509
 used to think that the fatter the curd 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.630
 better but it is digested better but then u 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.799
 familiar farmer visited he says 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.320
 something separator cream does not work well 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.380
 do not throw back and do not get cottage cheese 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 the whole passes through the gauze that is fat 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.759
 cottage cheese is impossible to get here 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.069
 artisanal conditions because when he 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:10.420
 fat he runs down 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:12.330
 along with this along with post-wait with 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.650
 reverse as it is called 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.069
 buttermilk is probably after butter here 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.890
 impudent brother serum and try what 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:27.040
 nothing happened but sugar then by 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.209
 whoever puts who does not put on 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.209
 it reminds the taste 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.590
 slightly reminiscent 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.640
 the so-called curd mass or 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.690
 curd mass 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.069
 These are sold if you add a raisin check 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.340
 who will be very similar at all 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.319
 reach a consistency like that but they are there 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.849
 add sugar syrup we it just 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:59.730
 sprinkling sugar and sometimes it happens 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:04.170
 very sweet and probably testicle but testicle 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.709
 they are likely to add concentrate to 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:13.060
 concentrate in the sense that it is not alive 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.819
 dried egg yes we still will not 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.989
 risk and beat ships raw eggs well 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.500
 by the way it is delicious it is delicious you can even 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.500
 say very 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.650
 You have not finished the year brother of the gate have learned 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.280
 do it with a little addition 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.280
 of milk 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.450
 Tallinn throws him whether that and to 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.500
 he was thick there adds this here 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.660
 palm oil and that's hard to buy 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.850
 low fat cottage cheese with 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.850
 low is like there 5-6 percent to 9 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.280
 checks show 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.420
 Well, there people wrote that they checked there 20 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.500
 percent twenty five percent 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400
 fat content 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.340
 curd but then add it 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.530
 why sour cream because cottage cheese like me and 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.680
 spoke bold in vivo 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.130
 therefore it is impossible to get 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.240
 cottage cheese should not be fatter if it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.340
 deliberately did not bold on nothing 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.940
 there was added the type of oil of some kind 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:34.650
 then he will be no more than nine percent 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.410
 But the problem is that even with 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.040
 good milk combine is not easy 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.250
 get good curd but what do we 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.790
 remains remains there is what is 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.930
 Well, by the way, and milk why milk if 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.230
 to someone 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.990
 Here is such a mass then just pour in there 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.300
 milk and all strictly speaking for this 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.770
 we have it 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.770
 I hope I did not spoil your appetite 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.100
 tale of cottage cheese 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:13.070
 but don't worry in the curd mixtures there 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:17.510
 there may even be more different ones 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:21.620
 eat so-called beneficial substances 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.290
 that's it that's basically enough to 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.220
 man, I think it is quite breakfast 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:32.290
 intuition pen 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.190
 there you have it but I am with you now 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.580
