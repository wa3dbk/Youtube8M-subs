okay so again ws 4945 comes out of the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.960 
okay so again ws 4945 comes out of the
box<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> magnet<00:00:17.550> inside<00:00:17.820> of

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
box like this with the magnet inside of

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880 
box like this with the magnet inside of
the<00:00:18.029> bag<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> screws<00:00:18.750> you'll<00:00:19.410> notice<00:00:19.740> on

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the bag with the screws you'll notice on

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
the bag with the screws you'll notice on
this<00:00:20.039> contact<00:00:20.460> there's<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.090> little<00:00:21.420> marker

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
this contact there's a little marker

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
this contact there's a little marker
which<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.949> magnet<00:00:23.340> wants<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> line

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
which is what the magnet wants to line

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.779 
which is what the magnet wants to line
up<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> center<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.740> okay<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.699> we're

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
up the center with okay so what we're

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.980 
up the center with okay so what we're
going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.269> we're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.660> go<00:00:27.810> into

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
going to do is we're going to go into

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
going to do is we're going to go into
programming<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.910> into

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
programming on this to get into

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
programming on this to get into
programming<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.750> mess<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.320> installer<00:00:31.710> code

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
programming the mess the installer code

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.490 
programming the mess the installer code
is<00:00:32.189> five<00:00:32.610> five<00:00:32.850> five<00:00:33.059> five<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.260> you're<00:00:34.350> going

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is five five five five so you're going

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.340 
is five five five five so you're going
to<00:00:34.559> press<00:00:34.710> star<00:00:35.010> eight<00:00:35.280> five<00:00:36.180> five<00:00:36.480> five<00:00:37.020> five

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to press star eight five five five five

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
to press star eight five five five five
now<00:00:38.250> these<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:38.910> nice<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
now these are really nice because it's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.920 
now these are really nice because it's
very<00:00:40.079> simple<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.739> learn<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.129> sensors<00:00:41.670> in

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
very simple to learn these sensors in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.209 
very simple to learn these sensors in
okay<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:42.989> you're<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.649> under<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
okay so you're going to go under it

tells you on the in the booklet with
which<00:00:45.780> field<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.739> eight

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
which field which is going to be eight

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.819 
which field which is going to be eight
nine<00:00:47.129> eight<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.410> it's<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> show<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
nine eight and it's going to show you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
nine eight and it's going to show you
wireless<00:00:50.340> enrollment<00:00:50.910> mode<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.840> you're

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
wireless enrollment mode so all you're

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
wireless enrollment mode so all you're
going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> place

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
going to do now is you're going to place

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.779 
going to do now is you're going to place
the<00:00:53.940> magnet<00:00:54.360> next<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.730> little<00:00:56.730> marker

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
the magnet next to that little marker

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.099 
the magnet next to that little marker
you're<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> hear<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> beep<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.899> going

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
to show you the ESN number took it in

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.160 
to show you the ESN number took it in
you<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.049> press<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> start<00:01:05.780> right<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:06.840> we're

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you just press the start right now we're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.260 
you just press the start right now we're
going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> program<00:01:07.590> zone<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.030> need<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
going to program zone one if you need it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.969 
going to program zone one if you need it
to<00:01:09.299> programs<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.229> zone<00:01:10.409> three<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.799> just

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to programs on to or zone three we just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
to programs on to or zone three we just
enter<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.970> we'll<00:01:12.180> leave<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.510> one

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
enter it here so we'll leave it at one

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
enter it here so we'll leave it at one
nothing<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.260> programmed<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> yet<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
next one is going to be the zone type

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.399 
next one is going to be the zone type
zero<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.119> entry<00:01:18.659> exit<00:01:18.810> meaning

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
zero one on these is entry exit meaning

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
zero one on these is entry exit meaning
that<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> delay<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.430> coming<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> or
