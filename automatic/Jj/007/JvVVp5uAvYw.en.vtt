00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 then are today a lot of ideas 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.979
 received on 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.370
 on cooking and on cooking at the 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.830
 steam 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 if we could say a little bit to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 internet users what are the advantages of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.560
 killer with steam and maybe their 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.270
 explain that it not last steam 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.270
 inevitably fan what types of foods 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.480
 so 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 cooking is not it's a problem 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
 because it will be good 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.780
 go up yourself 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 without pesticides 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.640
 6 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.210
 between powerful words clusters 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.489
 lawyer 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.350
 6 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:59.210
 the mode of cooking which respects better 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:01.500
 food is all because for all 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.190
 that it is a censorship 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 all these novices having closed so 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.560
 it is not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560
 not 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.020
 all are under pressure 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:30.880
 no you 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.880
 so cooking view is the basis 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:46.020
 so I thought not eating everything 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 believed but still there are some 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.160
 steps for example you soak 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 legumes down once soaked 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.090
 you still have 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.870
 soaking it's already something 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.500
 of soaking it's already a step that 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.000
 very well so all he has 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 people who can not rigged well 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.030
 easy to chew the legumes for 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.980
 the leathers we will soak them we will not 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.799
 the readings of a directly in the water 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.799
 without you the 30 the day before 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.530
 and you can either eat them all from 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.740
 next let germinate under others 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 days be the kitchens and the leathers and 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.240
 there you will love him for five minutes 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.360
 on the parquet for italy there 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.900
 report it's a great couscous and with 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.610
 a lot of gray water one floor with 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.270
 pretty big shots 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.530
 m and then a bombay lid that goes 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.780
 to permit 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.230
 is that the assembly propelled the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.640
 innovative steam that will flow 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.360
 around the food that will make 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.890
 sweat 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.890
 he will sweat 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:23.880
 and the dolo program is unique and it goes 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.910
 not be touched by our donations is not going 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.290
 lose those minerals and you have to measure 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.710
 that steam cooking and finally finds 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.140
 because it gives birth to a lot more 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.410
 quick 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.410
 if you refuse 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.110
 France 3 minutes you tap into the pan 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:01.110
 it shows well this penetration and a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.960
 part of the fats and then when he is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.700
 that in the pan I also imagine that it 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.600
 was going badly it's not good because 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.440
 that its periphery causes 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.440
 actions exceed saturated 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.210
 stage 2 transformations 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.330
 com 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.160
 easy to chew so we will not 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.250
 then in France 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.010
 that's sugar diabetes by 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.300
 power is quite there are some 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.040
 recipes and tips in all 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.080
 places the first the practical guide to 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.120
 gastronomy goes around the question of 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.780
 mutations of a website but we want 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.780
 touch at the health level with 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.720
 7 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.720
 100 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.789
 the book on the sweet steam and at the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:25.860
 swimming the one that also contains 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:25.860
 explanations and contains possible 7 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.440
 and then my house 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.930
 exit 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.930
 it's even race and education 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.340
 what the year 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.490
 put back all the parameters of common sense 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.490
 in place 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.570
 and suddenly one last question on 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.750
 the often received idea that steam 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:05.790
 sweet dirty job nice flavors not 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.090
 try because the opposite since 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.010
 steam cooking over line then 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.810
 obviously if you put salt during 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.240
 that his teeth over steam the salt he's going 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.740
 to leave you must not leave the food 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.479
 food he kept everything that he 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.910
 does it belong what is it that you 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:24.210
 does not belong but out of the crowd 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:27.750
 it's there at the moment the food gives off 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.530
 the steam that must be put thyme on 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.110
 knows the simple seasoning baumette 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.550
 fast cooking finally five minutes on 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.229
 not peel because we keep the skin 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.010
 which contains other vitamins and 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.520
 minerals 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.700
 so basically this good before the partials 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:47.280
 but it's very fast cooking 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.550
 pipes by five minutes five minutes on 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.150
 French seasonings 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.150
 a dish
