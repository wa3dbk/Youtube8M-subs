00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.500 

you

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.510 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.360 

this<00:00:08.510> is<00:00:08.690> an<00:00:08.809> explanation<00:00:09.139> a<00:00:09.590> description<00:00:10.070> of

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
this is an explanation a description of

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.150 
this is an explanation a description of
the<00:00:10.700> process<00:00:10.969> involved<00:00:11.900> in<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:12.680> setting<00:00:13.039> up

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
the process involved in the setting up

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:22.730 
the process involved in the setting up
of<00:00:13.340> a<00:00:13.459> 10-meter<00:00:13.969> mushing<00:00:14.480> yurt

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:46.750 

love

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.680 

so<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.879> point<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> doesn't<00:00:48.540> really

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so at this point it doesn't really

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
so at this point it doesn't really
matter<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.260> much<00:00:49.290> about<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.769> counting<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
matter so much about the counting and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
matter so much about the counting and
getting<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.269> in<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.600> exact<00:00:52.460> corresponding

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
getting them in the exact corresponding

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.130 
getting them in the exact corresponding
position<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.360> lattice<00:00:56.840> finally<00:00:57.840> because

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
position of the lattice finally because

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.479 
position of the lattice finally because
it's<00:01:01.140> important<00:01:01.650> at<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.799> stage<00:01:01.860> just<00:01:02.339> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it's important at this stage just to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
it's important at this stage just to
stabilize<00:01:02.790> it<00:01:03.330> and<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
stabilize it and then you can do the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:14.230 
stabilize it and then you can do the
counting<00:01:05.280> after<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.470> actually

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
counting after you know actually

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.750 
counting after you know actually
measuring<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.570> heart<00:01:19.220> making<00:01:20.220> sure<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
measuring the heart making sure that's

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.760 
measuring the heart making sure that's
all<00:01:22.580> correct<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> Jewish<00:01:25.170> River

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
all correct the Jewish River

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.510 
all correct the Jewish River
to<00:01:27.250> come

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.430 

so<00:01:36.520> at<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.729> point<00:01:37.060> they're<00:01:38.020> going<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.200> stop

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
so at this point they're going to stop

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.330 
so at this point they're going to stop
for<00:01:38.620> lunch<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.860> height<00:01:42.070> that

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
for lunch and but the height that

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.399 
for lunch and but the height that
they've<00:01:42.550> got<00:01:43.150> at<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.600> moment<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:44.110> from<00:01:44.290> the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
they've got at the moment is from the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.150 
they've got at the moment is from the
underside<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.550> hub<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.690> ground<00:01:47.160> three

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
underside of the hub to the ground three

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.780 
underside of the hub to the ground three
point<00:01:48.430> seven<00:01:48.640> meters<00:01:53.250> forms<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.340> beautiful

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
point seven meters forms a beautiful

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.770 
point seven meters forms a beautiful
pattern<00:01:55.000> on<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.330> ground<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.880> retention<00:01:58.659> in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
pattern on the ground now retention in

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.260 
pattern on the ground now retention in
the<00:01:58.990> girth<00:01:59.890> rope<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.610> as<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:02.500> get<00:02:02.710> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the girth rope so as we get the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.400 
the girth rope so as we get the
different<00:02:04.270> you're<00:02:04.600> pregnant<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:05.110> find<00:02:05.350> a

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
different you're pregnant you find a

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.490 
different you're pregnant you find a
shape<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.070> right<00:02:06.369> as<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.990> before<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
shape of it right as the just before the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.250 
shape of it right as the just before the
way<00:02:08.679> your<00:02:08.890> goes<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:10.209> hold<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.019> to<00:02:11.080> the

way your goes on to the I hold on to the

way your goes on to the I hold on to the
wall

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830
