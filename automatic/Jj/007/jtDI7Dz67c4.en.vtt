00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:10.420
 So let's put shading first One tone than model's skin 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:17.129
 It is dark brown 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.129
 In particular , I will choose your bra rather than reddish than reddish 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.670
 The place to put in is the hairline of the aircraft 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:36.520
 And the shadowed area under the cheekbones 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.520
 From over the face love we will put to the side part of the face 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.360
 You can not get too many points 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.360
 It is to put in nature 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 Under the bones 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.589
 I 'm on the face line from the side of the face 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.589
 9 u to be the side of the face 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.690
 The effect of the effect and the face that looks to small face looks three-dimensional 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.690
 There is both 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.219
 Another one place 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 It is a part that is a shadow under the wharf It is a part called nose shadow 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.640
 I will put out the three-dimensional sense of the female carp 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.750
 The point is not to put too long so that the child who speaks does not become unnatural 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.750
 It will be seen in the shadow of the inner end of eyebrow 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.090
 You seek If more 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.500
 I will continue to highlight and put 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.050
 It looks like this is the opposite time out now 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:10.040
 I will put in the part I want to show high 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.040
 The place to put in is from below the rib called the season first 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.100
 This lesson under twisting 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 And the eyes of the three-dimensional effect by putting in this c zone 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.340
 There is a section that the color of eye shadow looks beautiful 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:37.830
 Please sleep after another one is called the triangular zone 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 This triangle with shading now from the lower eyelid is this triangle that looks like the front of the face 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.950
 Is a zone 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:47.000
 Brightening here makes shards look more wide-angle and has teak color 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.000
 Come out clean 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.330
 Then the center of expectation and 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:01.780
 It is thin and put it point to t zone is Hanasuko of over the time to speak 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.780
 Please be careful not to get too thick 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.690
 last 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.690
 It is the tip of the jaw tip 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 That's where the highlight goes 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.099
 Yes, we will put the next teak 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:47.130
 I was laughing at model first as a point to put teak 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.940
 You will get a brush where the meat in the protection will be highest so that here the thickest 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.819
 Apply 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.510
 Its was the model's direction sound of the conscious over the cheekbones 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:01.989
 I'm going to put teak towards the temple 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.989
 I will put it so that the highest part of the cheek is the deepest 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.990
 We will put in naturally so that the shape of teak can not be seen clearly too much and it blurs on the skin 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.120
 The above is teak
