00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.730
 Welcome to a dreamland where strange voices have come out 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.019
 Hello this is only a penny 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:18.610
 Weapons that use this time somehow noise's in what 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.610
 Barrel spinner Gatling I think this is also a weapon added in a large update 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.099
 I feel reflected in this spinner charge 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.250
 The rate of fire is also fast and can hit a distance similar to the jet sweeper 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.610
 There seems to be some kind of charger-like thing 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.290
 Basically, it looks like you are taking a distance 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.290
 Is it 48? 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 Well I do not know the paint performance is good 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.130
 Sub is a splash shield special but a tornado 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.610
 I wanted the sub to be rubber 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:56.739
 It will be manageable if you earn the time of charge with the shield and hit it 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.739
 Guillotines can also be sober and addicted to things so let's go play Let's Goja 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:08.619
 Well, the first stage is the first time in hokking videos 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:12.330
 Isn't it blue? Allies have three shooters on my spinner 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:15.770
 The other party is attached to the roller and one person is a shooter. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.679
 By the way, let's make the way for the opening charge 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.640
 Hot pedigree is also easy to paint I Ah quite like this song by a spinner because there is a lot of narrow passage 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.480
 Wow 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.200
 Splatoon's song is pretty good 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.570
 There is an enemy-but because it is my brother, I will not easily get close 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.250
 I hate this moving automotive thing 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 O'o' There are your enemy but here in the far Sasenzo 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.780
 Special accumulated 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.860
 Yosshiku Runade boulder Taki Aoi Squid Komaki 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.860
 When did you come 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.540
 Tornado kiter 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.780
 Yes yes removal removal spawn point is unbeatable 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.100
 I like the flirting sound of this swimming 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.150
 You like whatever you like, huh ? 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.900
 Make sure you haven't come 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.900
 Not here 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.350
 I'm not even there 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.170
 You're hiding in the air, be cautious 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.040
 I wonder if somewhere in there are Pablo that the sprinkler is 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.670
 Pain 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.260
 I missed it just by hitting it once 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.160
 It's not an enemy. 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.220
 It was a pro modeler I used to say at that distance. 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.220
 And I think it was late to notice it because I applied it 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.860
 In suddenly strange voice Agen Do I Ah, it's this guy the way Maji 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.620
 Oh let's keep the sprinkler there 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.910
 It is a nice sensor 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.200
 Isn't it a bath ? 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.560
 Well tornado departs after the charge is over 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.099
 It is the weak point of this weapon 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.950
 Tornado feelings even when seen at the farming now 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:07.510
 It seems like you are buying now 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.319
 Well we were met also good condition soon manner without permission 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.319
 Ambush ambush 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.829
 Rate of fire I hope wanted roller 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.939
 Other enemies are painted something I wish or not 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.939
 But it looks like there are no enemies 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.020
 Not 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.400
 Only a little more after I wonder if even unabashedly attacked 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.800
 See how 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.120
 It hurts 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.530

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.530
 Son Well then let's at least look 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.040

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.640

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.310
 Bent 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.940
 Feces dog is struck tornado Do Oh was the droppings 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.940
 It is this dangerous 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.360
 It will be lost if it does not increase the point because it is good even for the remaining seven seconds 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.960
 Finally Do not at all or which way now Do not wet win 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.599
 Uo Abunae 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.199
 A difference of 0.7 points was dangerous 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.199
 Good 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.050
