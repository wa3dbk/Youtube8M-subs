every day because too much of a good
thing<00:00:16.440> could<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> bad<00:00:16.890> thing<00:00:17.449> what<00:00:18.449> I'm

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
going to discuss our papaya treatments

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.929 
going to discuss our papaya treatments
and<00:00:20.400> papaya<00:00:21.359> um<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.080> actually<00:00:22.710> helps<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.550> break

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and papaya um is actually helps to break

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.439 
and papaya um is actually helps to break
down<00:00:24.180> dead<00:00:24.480> skin<00:00:24.779> cells<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.160> age<00:00:26.400> our<00:00:26.730> cells

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
down dead skin cells as we age our cells

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
down dead skin cells as we age our cells
turn<00:00:27.720> over<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> slower<00:00:28.320> pace<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.550> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
turn over at a slower pace when we're in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.589 
turn over at a slower pace when we're in
our<00:00:29.699> early<00:00:30.000> 20s

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
our early 20s

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.680 
our early 20s
our<00:00:31.109> cells<00:00:31.610> turn<00:00:32.610> over<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.820> every<00:00:33.180> 28<00:00:33.540> days

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
our cells turn over like every 28 days

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
our cells turn over like every 28 days
they<00:00:34.320> come<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> surface<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.430> then

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
they come up to the surface and then

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
they come up to the surface and then
they<00:00:36.420> sloth<00:00:36.690> off<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.350> new<00:00:37.739> cells<00:00:38.010> are

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
they sloth off and then new cells are

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
they sloth off and then new cells are
regenerated<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> process<00:00:39.239> usually<00:00:39.660> 28

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
regenerated and that process usually 28

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.470 
regenerated and that process usually 28
days<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.579> older<00:00:41.820> those<00:00:42.000> days<00:00:42.239> turn

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
days as we get older those days turn

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
days as we get older those days turn
into<00:00:42.510> 30<00:00:42.930> 40<00:00:43.500> 50<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.190> age<00:00:44.399> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
into 30 40 50 that's why we age so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
into 30 40 50 that's why we age so
basically<00:00:45.870> papaya<00:00:46.289> treatments<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.010> help

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
basically papaya treatments will help

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560 
basically papaya treatments will help
break<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.789> build-up<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> those<00:00:48.360> dead

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
break down the build-up of those dead

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
break down the build-up of those dead
skin<00:00:48.719> cells<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.980> help<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> speed<00:00:50.399> up

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
skin cells and will help to speed up

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.959 
skin cells and will help to speed up
that<00:00:50.640> process<00:00:50.700> again<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.539> papaya

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
that process again with papaya

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.420 
that process again with papaya
treatments<00:00:53.969> actually<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.079> done<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:56.190> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
treatments actually it's done it's just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
treatments actually it's done it's just
a<00:00:56.550> product<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.149> looks<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> gel<00:00:58.320> again

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
a product that looks like a gel again

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.209 
a product that looks like a gel again
and<00:01:00.350> basically<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> massage<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and basically you want to massage it on

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.230 
and basically you want to massage it on
the<00:01:02.309> skin<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.920> after<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.909> applied<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the skin and then after it's applied to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
the skin and then after it's applied to
the<00:01:06.510> skin<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> remember<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.130> neck<00:01:08.340> as

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the skin and remember to do your neck as

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.710 
the skin and remember to do your neck as
well<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> keep<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:12.030> 15

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
well you want to keep it on for 15

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710 
well you want to keep it on for 15
minutes<00:01:13.640> because<00:01:14.640> obviously<00:01:15.330> most<00:01:15.600> people

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
minutes because obviously most people

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
minutes because obviously most people
don't<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.259> steamer<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.979> home<00:01:17.220> steam

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
don't have a steamer at home steam

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.840 
don't have a steamer at home steam
actually<00:01:18.360> helps<00:01:18.960> speed<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> process<00:01:19.950> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
actually helps speed up the process so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
actually helps speed up the process so
that<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.780> heat<00:01:22.049> heat<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.100> steam

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that would be heat heat and steam

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
that would be heat heat and steam
actually<00:01:23.520> help<00:01:23.880> speed<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> process<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
actually help speed up the process of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
actually help speed up the process of
the<00:01:25.020> enzymes<00:01:25.380> working<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> break<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.250> those

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the enzymes working to break down those

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
the enzymes working to break down those
dead<00:01:26.850> skin<00:01:27.000> cells<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.470> those<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.740> us<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
dead skin cells so for those of us that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
dead skin cells so for those of us that
don't<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.430> steamers<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:29.970> home<00:01:30.150> 15<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> 20

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
don't have steamers at home 15 to 20

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
don't have steamers at home 15 to 20
minutes<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:32.040> recommend<00:01:32.430> keeping<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.850> on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
minutes I would recommend keeping it on

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
minutes I would recommend keeping it on
with<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> steamer<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.439> keep<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.740> for

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
with a steamer you can keep it on for

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
with a steamer you can keep it on for
about<00:01:35.040> 10<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:36.210> basically<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> do

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
about 10 and then basically what you do

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.880 
about 10 and then basically what you do
is<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:39.509> doesn't<00:01:39.780> harden<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.409> doesn't<00:01:40.680> dry

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is just it doesn't harden it doesn't dry

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.859 
is just it doesn't harden it doesn't dry
like<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> mask<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.390> rinse<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> off

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
like a mask and you just rinse it off

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.710 
like a mask and you just rinse it off
with<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> cloth<00:01:44.070> water

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
with you know a cloth water

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
with you know a cloth water
and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.590> proceed<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.399> moisturizers

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and then proceed with your moisturizers

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
and then proceed with your moisturizers
and<00:01:48.210> other<00:01:48.450> treatments<00:01:48.810> thereafter<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.340> I
