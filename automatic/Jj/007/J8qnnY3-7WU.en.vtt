00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
big here it's easy to read it tells you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
big here it's easy to read it tells you
some<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.260> offer<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
can see we can reach them on Facebook

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
can see we can reach them on Facebook
YouTube<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.899> it<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.140> Gmail<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
YouTube and it was like Gmail so it

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.459 
YouTube and it was like Gmail so it
looks<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.510> nice<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:51.989> clean<00:00:52.440> very

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
looks really nice it's very clean very

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.040 
looks really nice it's very clean very
easy<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.129> read<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> transparent

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
easy to read and I think the transparent

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
easy to read and I think the transparent
thing<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> somewhat<00:00:55.710> original<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> haven't<00:00:56.610> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
thing is somewhat original I haven't on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.310 
thing is somewhat original I haven't on
behalf<00:00:57.239> everything<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.780> business<00:00:57.840> Carl's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
behalf everything in business Carl's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.760 
behalf everything in business Carl's
transparent<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.770> that's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
transparent I really like it so that's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
transparent I really like it so that's
great<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> cubicle<00:01:03.320> here<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> got<00:01:04.530> some

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
great for the cubicle here I got some

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.800 
great for the cubicle here I got some
torpedoes<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.790> got<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> prototype

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
torpedoes I have got in a prototype

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.429 
torpedoes I have got in a prototype
zhanchi<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.860> want<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.100> tensions<00:01:08.549> loose<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
zhanchi and I want my tensions loose and

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.590 
zhanchi and I want my tensions loose and
it<00:01:10.439> did<00:01:10.830> pop<00:01:11.189> once<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.240> worried

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it did pop once so I'm kind of worried

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260 
it did pop once so I'm kind of worried
that<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:14.070> might<00:01:14.280> explode<00:01:14.610> every<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> solve

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that it might explode every time I solve

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.450 
that it might explode every time I solve
so<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> bought<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.020> torpedoes<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:17.159> really

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so I bought some torpedoes I'm really

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
so I bought some torpedoes I'm really
hoping<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.909> don't<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
hoping that I don't have to use like a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
hoping that I don't have to use like a
Rubik's<00:01:19.350> file<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.310> find<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> edges<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
Rubik's file to find out the edges I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.760 
Rubik's file to find out the edges I
think<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> file<00:01:22.530> down<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
think if I do have to file down the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100 
think if I do have to file down the
edges<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.220> order<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.450> torps<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
edges in order to get these torps in I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.289 
edges in order to get these torps in I
probably<00:01:25.439> won't<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> off<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
probably won't do it off I just have to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.380 
probably won't do it off I just have to
tighten<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:29.240> don't<00:01:30.240> want

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
tighten it back up because I don't want

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
tighten it back up because I don't want
to<00:01:30.450> alter<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.049> prototype<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.799> any<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.340> shape

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
to alter this prototype in any way shape

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.730 
to alter this prototype in any way shape
or<00:01:32.759> form<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:34.320> pretty<00:01:34.619> sure

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

the only thing I see right now is that

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.039 
the only thing I see right now is that
the<00:02:16.980> stickers<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.209> Geelong<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.749> caught<00:02:18.930> on
