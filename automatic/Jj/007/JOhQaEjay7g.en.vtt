 he finally succeeded and he slowly 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.190
 went to the house 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.800

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.739

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.470
 so the prince announced that if there was 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.240

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.460

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.660
