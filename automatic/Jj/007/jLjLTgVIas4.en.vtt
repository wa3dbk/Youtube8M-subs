they play the best so we just do what

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.550 
they play the best so we just do what
they<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.060> hopefully<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
they do and hopefully I don't know the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
they do and hopefully I don't know the
hype<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.029> reason<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
hype is just there for some reason I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.730

don't<00:00:27.420> know<00:00:27.570> why<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:28.109> haven't<00:00:28.140> won<00:00:28.439> anything

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
don't know I have no idea hopefully we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
don't know I have no idea hopefully we
can<00:00:40.829> win<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.190> using<00:00:41.520> their<00:00:41.640> own<00:00:41.670> strategies

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149

pressure and they just had jungle

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.410 
pressure and they just had jungle
pressure<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> good<00:01:09.180> trade

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
pressure so it was kind of a good trade

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.310 
pressure so it was kind of a good trade
for<00:01:09.450> us<00:01:09.659> even<00:01:09.810> though<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> didn't<00:01:10.200> look<00:01:10.260> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
for us even though it didn't look like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289 
for us even though it didn't look like
it<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.159> nasus<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.030> need<00:01:12.119> items

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it but nasus doesn't really need items

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
it but nasus doesn't really need items
or<00:01:12.570> farm<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.900> anything<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> worked

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
or farm or anything so it kind of worked

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
or farm or anything so it kind of worked
out<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.850> how<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> adapt<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> situation<00:01:16.020> like

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
out so how do you adapt a situation like

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.330 
out so how do you adapt a situation like
that<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.259> can't<00:01:16.560> imagine<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.979> play<00:01:17.130> many

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

like<00:01:30.210> maybe<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.869> time<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.049> happens<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> me<00:01:31.530> then

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like maybe one time I happens to me then

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
like maybe one time I happens to me then
I<00:01:31.770> react<00:01:32.040> badly<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> next

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
I react badly to it and then the next

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.580 
I react badly to it and then the next
time<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.840> okay<00:01:34.020> I'll<00:01:34.110> try<00:01:34.200> something<00:01:34.530> else

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and eventually I just pick up like what

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.050 
and eventually I just pick up like what
works<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> best<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.060> okay

when<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.150> don't<00:02:30.240> really<00:02:30.390> argue

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
when you do that we don't really argue

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.940 
when you do that we don't really argue
anymore<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.290> actually<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.650> fun<00:02:31.830> with

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the game we have fun with screams so I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.000 
the game we have fun with screams so I
just<00:02:33.870> think<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> environment<00:02:34.590> around<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.890> is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
just think the environment around it is

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.380 
just think the environment around it is
better<00:02:35.190> like<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.700> fun<00:02:35.880> while<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.180> scream
