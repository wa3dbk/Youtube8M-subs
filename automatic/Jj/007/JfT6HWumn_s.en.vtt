the spirits were born sometimes we have
to<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.369> difficult<00:01:50.550> choices<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.450> change<00:01:51.659> to

to make difficult choices for change to
occur<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:53.159> spirits<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.729> proof<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.350> maybe

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
occur the spirits are proof that maybe

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.289 
occur the spirits are proof that maybe
their<00:01:55.590> current<00:01:55.920> form<00:01:55.979> shows<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.790> future<00:01:57.180> they

interlock a hope to create yes I think

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.670 
interlock a hope to create yes I think
you<00:02:00.659> might<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:02.149> one<00:02:03.149> day<00:02:03.360> ba<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.259> might

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
you might be right one day ba you might

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
you might be right one day ba you might
also<00:02:04.890> face<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> decision<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.060> becoming<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
also face the decision of becoming a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.560 
also face the decision of becoming a
spirit<00:02:07.250> if<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.489> spirits<00:02:08.970> represent

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
spirit if the spirits represent

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
so this is Ray Lewis wheeze yes bowel

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.979 
so this is Ray Lewis wheeze yes bowel
says<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.940> don't<00:03:07.390> see<00:03:07.599> any<00:03:07.750> air
