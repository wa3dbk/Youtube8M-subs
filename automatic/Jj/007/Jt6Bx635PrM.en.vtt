in<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.270> storm<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:24.200> way<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.440> could

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
in the storm that way you could

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.530 
in the storm that way you could
translate<00:02:24.950> everything<00:02:25.490> into<00:02:25.730> his<00:02:26.030> picture

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
like a method painter sugar has

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.270 
like a method painter sugar has
dissolved<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:32.440> once<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.620> comes<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> boil

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
dissolved and once it comes to the boil

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.340 
dissolved and once it comes to the boil
just<00:02:35.210> take<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.570> off<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> heat<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.230> want

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
just take it off the heat and you want

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.330 
just take it off the heat and you want
to<00:02:36.410> call<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.140> thin<00:02:39.650> bit<00:02:40.220> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
to call it it's just that thin bit of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.820 
to call it it's just that thin bit of
color<00:02:40.640> which<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.270> come<00:02:41.540> through

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
color which is going to come through

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.700 
color which is going to come through
and<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:44.400> my<00:02:44.760> sardines<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:46.110> might<00:02:46.320> just<00:02:46.470> want

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
and then my sardines you might just want

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.100 
and then my sardines you might just want
to<00:02:46.740> check<00:02:46.830> there<00:02:47.250> aren't<00:02:47.400> any<00:02:47.520> bones<00:02:47.700> left

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
