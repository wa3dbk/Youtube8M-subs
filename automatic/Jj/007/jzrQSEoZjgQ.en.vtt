00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.010
 in 1999 when there is the psg om where the om 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 must come to get the title at the park 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.840
 princes paris no longer beat marseille 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.349
 at the park for seven years that's a lot 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.820
 still 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.859
 in today's era when what 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.690
 would say it's over it could have even 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.300
 sharks before it's not possible we get them 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 beats more it's more possible at the beginning 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.390
 of the 2000s Paris had to go on 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.949
 eight wins in a row that's it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 believe that there was the big 8 against 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.400
 om it was more possible om om bat 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.779
 not what you almost all agree 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.450
 is staked life the holy paris 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 germain is there on the pretext that so the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 psg has a lot of means and not the om 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.579
 we must all buried 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 atletico madrid has not beaten 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.640
 calderon the real for 15 years to that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 reality disappears 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.719
 no liverpool has been in the bag but 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.879
 in the bag of bags at the end of the years 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.739
 90 while manchester shines is this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.870
 that it made disappear no rivalry 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.399
 the spurs of tottenham payfa by 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 normal hearing 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.949
 the juve and the torino the torino with nothing 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 win for 30 years no but in France 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.100
 apparently four minutes that tobacco 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 in France is not the story of his 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.129
 football and we do not know anything about 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.380
 the history of his football 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.490
 it does not interest us and ben if that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.290
 not interest us to tell 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.460
 stories but we are not interested anymore 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.960
 football continues to tell 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.150
 bullshit it's me I'm in love with 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.869
 this sport a passionate about its history and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.600
 I like what people say 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.420
 real deschamps who is a coach at 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 part who is a guy who still knows 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.090
 do it in terms of building a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 group and I believe he went back into 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 a logic of building a group and 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.009
 that all the debate around them he has to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.560
 take such a he must take so-and-so 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 all this for me no more sense 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.590
 deschamps lived it himself in blue at 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 the time of the construction of the group of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.100
 backgammon he did it also with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.400
 monaco where he realized that with a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.840
 group but a harmless group he goes in 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.390
 league final of champions by doing 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 a dingo course he is able to 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.700
 do this kind of feat deschamps here 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 this is it so I'm not telling you who is going 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.880
 super makes me big signs yes 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.409
 it's shock do not say they're going 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.240
 win they can win they are 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.469
 favorites or what I'm just saying that at my 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.990
 meaning they will still be difficult to 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.799
 go out at least at least we'll go to 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 the world cup with a team 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.140
 consistent 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 yes, it was too long ago 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.439
 was under construction in defense 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.179
 did not have a midfielder late 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.319
 but it was not that we had 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.430
 not that we do not know we did not know 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.599
 not at all where we were going 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.769
 11 there is one but why does that 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.359
 not him who plays why it's not a 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.189
 such absentees were always wrong 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.879
 how many times have we traded with roland 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.989
 on it we did with rolland the 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.760
 hand in hand every 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.290
 competitions in the after that cry 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.209
 on the shoulders to be him more and has 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.040
 good to remove a good cistella evening 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.209
 it's for me and every time the point 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.469
 common is started but still 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.209
 say it was the absentees who had 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.250
 reason he played to redo some 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.290
 during had for six years roland there this 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.659
 evening at least we can say the middle 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 will not settle for me that why locates 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:46.379
 to compliment the magician 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 these three there they will stay it's like 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.189
 that for the defense maybe one or two 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.989
 positions that can still evolve but one 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.489
 the men and must arrive 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.879
 benzema is probably the third 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.620
 man who should still so you 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.599
 leaving for the first time since 2006 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.849
 with a team that is built 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.049
 no more tual construction site is leader 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.060
 now we know who this is 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.680
 hierarchy earlier up if benzema 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.879
 continue like that we finally have benzema 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.840
 we have been waiting since 2008 because 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.030
 people have now we will be told you 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.469
 you had criticized him since 2008 he 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.049
 you say nothing you would not even say 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.530
 not you enjoy that makes you want to 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.370
 to follow her 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.959
 here is to be behind toyota group who 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 is easy you can hope for the eighth 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.099
 and after all depends on the draw of your 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.500
 adversary finally ended up sometimes 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.210
 to do because or eighth in the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.660
 lessons to be learned 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.000
 we never really know what to think 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.440
 but today what you see 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.910
 it is that actually as already well 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.370
 years have not seen anything 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.870
 thing of a spirit as positive and that 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.910
 just what is it that there are 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.500
 players who are positive that a guy 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.790
 like that became important in 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.560
 the group while it's a guy who has 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.190
 a mega positive state of mind it's a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.650
 nice bro 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.510
 mamadou sakho very well that 1 blaise 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.160
 matuidi became important while 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.230
 he's a guy, he's absolutely 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.220
 great that a supplement all we 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.490
 brings back to laurie pointed cabaye des 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.540
 tweets on their side of guys like three 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.160
 people like debuchy 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.650
 finally all these people drowned the 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.720
 old ones that we experienced the disillusions that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.239
 were extremely critical and jostled 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.040
 it even allowed them to redeem a 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.530
 kind of redo a health of himself 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.690
 redeem a virginity she and the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.460
 ribery who feel better benzema 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.100
 who seems to have forgotten how much they 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.630
 have been criticized evra seems almost 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.190
 appears almost like a person 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.810
 now in this team we forget 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.920
 almost he is one in the woods 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.750
 now he is there he is there what 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.980
 here is another positive thing about this 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.590
 level there that I will tell you continuous price 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.660
 banon but I was raised but I 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.090
 changed builds his group around that 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.340
 and actually I will not repeat the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.230
 list of guys helping guys there but 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.640
 these guys have brought a real wind of 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.200
 freshness in this team him ten 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.700
 millions more in the budget for 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.290
 recruit players is and the oriental 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.270
 and the third in this league 1 and 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.820
 the third most absolutely loved dishes 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.870
 3rd just eric with with half of that 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.870
 what did the om spend last summer
