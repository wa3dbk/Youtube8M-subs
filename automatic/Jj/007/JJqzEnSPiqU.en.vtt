00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.570 

you<00:02:03.439> can<00:02:03.590> see<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:03.860> went<00:02:04.009> ahead<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.220> broke<00:02:04.430> the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
you can see it went ahead and broke the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.190 
you can see it went ahead and broke the
bead<00:02:04.759> all<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.060> way<00:02:05.180> around<00:02:05.509> sometimes<00:02:06.020> it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
bead all the way around sometimes it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.169 
bead all the way around sometimes it
doesn't<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.649> that<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.759> want<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.000> make<00:02:08.149> sure

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
doesn't do that so you want to make sure

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.570 
doesn't do that so you want to make sure
that<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:09.350> do<00:02:09.530> get<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> bead<00:02:10.009> broke<00:02:10.280> all<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580

that you do get the bead broke all the
way<00:02:10.670> around<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.190> really<00:02:16.550> more<00:02:16.700> important

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
way around this is really more important

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.360 
way around this is really more important
for<00:02:19.090> getting<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> tire<00:02:20.450> back<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.140> rim<00:02:21.370> but

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
for getting the tire back on the rim but

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
for getting the tire back on the rim but
it's<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.180> good<00:02:23.360> habit<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:23.840> into<00:02:28.390> see

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
it's just a good habit to get into see

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.670 
it's just a good habit to get into see
it<00:02:29.510> didn't<00:02:29.750> break<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.019> on<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.260> side<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:32.680> I'm

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
it didn't break it on this side so I'm

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.199 
it didn't break it on this side so I'm
going<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.890> go<00:02:34.010> ahead<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.250> go<00:02:34.340> after<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:34.730> this

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
going to go ahead and go after it this

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.970
