00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.180
 hello good this time I bring you one 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:10.050
 tutorial to correct an error that 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.660
 often gives very often 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.190
 especially for when it was playing 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 in a game or an application that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.260
 they consume a lot of graphics that give a lot 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 work to the graphics card and about 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 all in powerful games games and we 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 this error message comes out the control the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.989
 ego screen driver 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.650
 respond and has recovered well the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.660
 world 7 windows vista 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.880
 to be the solution for windows 7 or 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.470
 windows even seen windows 8 I think that 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.970
 as well 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.690
 happens that that usually happens is that the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.360
 screen driver 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.880
 does not answer I know it paralyzes because 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.390
 the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.570
 the data is not able to process 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 so much and suffers a delay then what 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 does windows windows pause the program and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.900
 wait a couple of seconds to see if the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.390
 graphic controller 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.810
 he recovers and returns to 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 and you can continue with the process that 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.280
 I was executing I say that most of 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 if the time is not playing 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.119
 can continue playing then there is a 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.720
 solution that is to increase the time of 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:39.520
 wait for windows to give the graph to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.920
 which is restored is restored by 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.470
 defect comes with 2 seconds but a 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 sometimes this is little then if in that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.610
 period has not been restored gives us a 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.479
 serious mistake sometimes we have to 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.479
 even 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.820
 reset the computer restart the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.210
 then there is a solution 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 who has microsoft for this problem 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.629
 which is to give more time to the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.510
 graphic card so that it 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:14.690
 so that it is restored not so that it 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.150
 update in the process how it is done 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.930
 this can not be done manually by going 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.230
 to an editor that has windows that is 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.980
 better than if you do not know then why not 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.200
 get an annex hack and in microsoft 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.849
 offers us the possibility of doing so 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.269
 through a program that does not do it in 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.670
 a second and it's very simple I'll put 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.940
 below this video the link so that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.319
 go and you download the program to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.460
 program 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.490
 is on this web and this is 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.150
 This is a method to increase the time of 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.980
 processing process of gpu unit 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.590
 of graphic processes adjusting the value 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.630
 from the waiting time to detection and 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.660
 record recovery what I have 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.280
 explained more or less good you go to this 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.459
 page 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.330
 I have them left in line below 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.730
 you go down a little bit from the bar 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.190
 and here you have it you give here 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.739
 I already gave it before but I'm not going to 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.860
 finish the process but for you to see 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.860
 how's it going 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.599
 so if it was good or not 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.330
 I think it's good 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.940
 I will pass this the second well we 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.790
 open a window that asks us 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.710
 execute or save we will give to 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.710
 execute , we execute 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.790
 the little window opens 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.670
 we accept the contract we give them the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.950
 next and I will not give it anymore because 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.750
 do it I did it a while ago and I do not 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.330
 I think it's good to repeat several times 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.160
 the same operation because maybe not 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:10.680
 it's good it would be without selling the next 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.960
 this runs in a few seconds is a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.910
 very fast thing and then we go 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.790
 to ask to restart the computer 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.540
 we restart the computer 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.060
 we have solved the problem 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.830
 that the problem of the controlled the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.410
 screen is not solved at a hundred 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.500
 one hundred 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.950
 but if it has been solved in a 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.400
 very high percentage 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.330
 those for whom that problem was 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.510
 justito 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.760
 He finished hanging the computer as 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.320
 will be solved for those who have 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.930
 a serious problem because it has a 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.190
 very old graphics card and you are 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.340
 giving a lot of cane they are demanding 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.770
 much this will alleviate a little the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.100
 thing but it's not going to be the solution the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:02.490
 solution is to update the computer and 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.490
 point or update the graph but 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.309
 let's update the whole team 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.079
 well then the one that can clear but good 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.089
 this is a method to release a 

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:16.359
 little bit the program the problem and in 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:18.729
 many cases as it is in my case to me 

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:21.489
 he has solved I had that problem and 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.399
 with this after doing this I no longer 

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:27.099
 that problem has come back 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:27.939
 would go to the limit between power 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.169
 work well 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:36.399
 and wrong and with this then what what does 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.499
 the program is if it sometimes stops and goes out 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:40.629
 the problem the problem stops for a 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:43.089
 little the screen but as it has more 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.449
 time to wait for the response of the 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.449
 graph 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.280
 the graph is updated and solved 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.349
 the problem and I continue with a game without 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.710
 no problem well I hope that you 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:00.479
 serve and if you have served you liked 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.479
 the video as yes 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.210
 and thank you very much for 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.319
 then that attention 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.319
 OK, good bye
