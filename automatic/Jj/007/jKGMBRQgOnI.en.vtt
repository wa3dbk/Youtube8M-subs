Xbox<00:00:25.619> games<00:00:25.859> obviously<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

MotoGP<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.310> MotoGP<00:00:29.310> games<00:00:29.849> seem<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
MotoGP is but the MotoGP games seem to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.970 
MotoGP is but the MotoGP games seem to
be<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> lot<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:30.929> realistic<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.619> actually

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
be a lot more realistic this actually

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.049 
be a lot more realistic this actually
looks<00:00:32.189> pretty<00:00:32.250> piss-poor

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
looks pretty piss-poor

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and free plate but also you have

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500 
and free plate but also you have
challenges<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.030> they're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
challenges that you can do but they're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.690 
because I had no idea what I was doing
but<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> guys<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
but as you guys can see it it's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
but as you guys can see it it's
basically<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.210> any<00:01:33.420> other<00:01:33.659> MotoGP<00:01:34.350> game<00:01:34.560> but

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
basically like any other MotoGP game but

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.010 
basically like any other MotoGP game but
just<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.430> graphics<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.600> bad<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.960 
look a fair bit better I know that was a
shock

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
shock

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you guys can see this is pretty damn bad

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
you guys can see this is pretty damn bad
but<00:01:50.190> let's<00:01:50.370> just<00:01:50.550> do<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> lap<00:01:51.330> or<00:01:51.540> two<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:52.020> over

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
but let's just do a lap or two here over

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.930 
but let's just do a lap or two here over
in<00:01:52.530> Salt<00:01:53.100> Lake<00:01:53.130> City<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:55.280> fire<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.550> textures

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
in Salt Lake City the fire the textures

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.580 
in Salt Lake City the fire the textures
that<00:01:56.970> are<00:01:57.090> far<00:01:57.390> away<00:01:57.660> they<00:01:57.900> don't<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.560> don't

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that are far away they don't they don't

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.850 
that are far away they don't they don't
look<00:01:58.860> very<00:01:58.920> good<00:01:59.490> quality<00:02:00.300> at<00:02:00.720> all<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.590> sound

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
look very good quality at all the sound

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580 
look very good quality at all the sound
is<00:02:02.040> pretty<00:02:02.250> good<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.970> from<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.200> type<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
is pretty good but from this type of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.310 
is pretty good but from this type of
game<00:02:04.980> that's<00:02:05.250> coming<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.210> 2012<00:02:07.020> he

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
game that's coming out in 2012 he

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
game that's coming out in 2012 he
definitely<00:02:07.770> expects<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> heck<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.149> lot<00:02:09.240> more

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
definitely expects a heck of a lot more

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.510 
definitely expects a heck of a lot more
but<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:10.800> about<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> main

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
but when you think about it the main

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.740 
but when you think about it the main
people<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.820> are<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.300> buying<00:02:12.570> this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
people that are going to be buying this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.630 
people that are going to be buying this
game<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> ones<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.070> already<00:02:14.310> are

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
game are the ones that already are

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.720 
game are the ones that already are
massive<00:02:15.090> fans<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:16.260> SPK<00:02:16.770> series<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.520> guess

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
massive fans of the SPK series I guess

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.970 
massive fans of the SPK series I guess
because<00:02:17.940> he<00:02:18.690> seems<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.080> go<00:02:19.170> back<00:02:19.350> all<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.890> way

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
because he seems to go back all the way

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.760 
because he seems to go back all the way
till<00:02:20.310> 2009<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.720> rather<00:02:22.500> popular

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
till 2009 so it's a rather popular

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.910 
till 2009 so it's a rather popular
series<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.490> seems<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.560> yeah<00:02:25.560> they<00:02:25.709> just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
series it seems like and yeah they just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.850 
series it seems like and yeah they just
wanted<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.400> release<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.260> compilation<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.650> guess

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
wanted to release a compilation I guess

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.300 
wanted to release a compilation I guess
of<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.459> their<00:02:29.670> latest<00:02:30.000> games<00:02:30.270> into<00:02:31.170> one<00:02:31.590> game

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
of all their latest games into one game

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.699 
of all their latest games into one game
called<00:02:32.640> generations<00:02:33.300> which<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.780> some<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> that

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
called generations which is some of that

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.800 
called generations which is some of that
many<00:02:35.160> games<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.610> seems<00:02:35.940> who<00:02:36.150> started<00:02:36.630> doing

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
many games have seems who started doing

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.770 
many games have seems who started doing
like<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.050> think<00:02:37.230> Sonic<00:02:37.800> Generations<00:02:38.600> has<00:02:39.600> been

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
like I think Sonic Generations has been

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.380 
like I think Sonic Generations has been
doing<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.730> they<00:02:41.940> joined<00:02:42.240> up

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
doing that so I think they joined up

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.270 
doing that so I think they joined up
like<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> first<00:02:43.230> couple<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.620> Sonic<00:02:43.920> games<00:02:44.130> or

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
like the first couple of Sonic games or

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.060 
like the first couple of Sonic games or
something<00:02:44.670> into<00:02:45.390> some<00:02:45.630> new<00:02:45.870> 3ds<00:02:46.410> Shabangu

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
something into some new 3ds Shabangu

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.729 
something into some new 3ds Shabangu
sure<00:02:47.970> Mazal<00:02:48.300> thing<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:49.320> not<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.680> that

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
sure Mazal thing it's not really that

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.320 
sure Mazal thing it's not really that
exciting<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.519> guys<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.880> see<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
exciting but as you guys can see this

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.900 
exciting but as you guys can see this
game<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.870> rather<00:02:52.470> disappointing<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.220> suck<00:02:53.790> at

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
game is rather disappointing I suck at

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.210 
game is rather disappointing I suck at
earning<00:02:54.269> there's<00:02:54.510> only<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> couple<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
earning there's only really a couple of

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.740 
earning there's only really a couple of
options<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.820> have<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.540> can

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
options that you have in this you can

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.550 
options that you have in this you can
like<00:02:58.970> obviously<00:02:59.970> accelerate<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.690> brake<00:03:00.720> but

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
like obviously accelerate and brake but

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140 
like obviously accelerate and brake but
that's<00:03:01.709> about<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.370> change<00:03:02.640> gears<00:03:02.970> but

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that's about it you can change gears but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
that's about it you can change gears but
I'm<00:03:03.209> playing<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.630> manual<00:03:04.019> but<00:03:04.200> there's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
I'm playing on manual but there's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.930 
I'm playing on manual but there's
nothing<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.340> else<00:03:05.550> that's<00:03:05.790> so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
nothing really the else that's so

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.490 
nothing really the else that's so
exciting<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.540> can't<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.019> move<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
exciting you can't like move the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.890 
exciting you can't like move the
character<00:03:07.980> around<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.580> back<00:03:08.820> or<00:03:09.150> not

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
character around on the back or not

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.600 
character around on the back or not
nothing<00:03:10.260> groundbreaking<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.489> this

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
nothing groundbreaking at all in this

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.370 
nothing groundbreaking at all in this
which<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.060> very<00:03:12.480> disappointing<00:03:12.600> go

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
which is very disappointing go
