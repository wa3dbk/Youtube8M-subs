 idol in England as in Toulon jonny 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.330
 wilkinson is the captain of a team 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.730
 to the British accent with ancient sheridan 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.950
 pillar of sail the brothers armitage more 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.689
 hot on the bench it's 5 cogs 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.420
 English for Toulon mechanics 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.340
 well oiled still attention to the game 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.470
 legs of the opener opposite danny 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.140
 cipriani the otan presented as the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.490
 successor of jones a little spray on 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.439
 the hands the Toulonses need 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.119
 because the weather is also English 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.160
 sÃ©bastien bruno knows well 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 he played five years ac I knew that 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.730
 I would have peace at the last 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.380
 year with that every one matches we have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.810
 played under the support and so it did not 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.460
 Too much change this morning I was a bit of a 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.320
 little bit confused I saw the sun I 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.200
 been surprised but me that time is 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.910
 income as I was waiting for the balloon 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.460
 is slippery in these conditions it's 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.870
 normal scorers are in the spotlight 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.010
 wilkinson responds to cipriani 3 everywhere one 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.750
 works all week for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.700
 develop a little more our game and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 try to fetch a point of 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.000
 offensive bonus 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.830
 but the conditions were not there 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.960
 to be able to play away the balloons 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.000
 so we will try to tighten up a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.750
 little and then play a little more on 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.780
 our footwork 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.250
 this is offensive and this foot game 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.190
 offensive he is served by jonny 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.750
 wilkinson 30th minute candle fernandes 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.520
 dawn and deviates for miss windows 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.050
 the New Zealander winger puts the turbo 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.050
 direction in goal 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.540
 the smith test is validated after 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 video refereeing 8.3 for toulon danny 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 Cipriani brings his team back to 8 to 6 but 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.090
 not enough to ignite the audience of the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.460
 suburb of manchester though some 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.659
 have released the gala outfits 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.430
 wilkinson immediately restores five points 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.259
 in advance to Toulon on 6 at the half time 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.290
 under the eyes of a laporte bernard 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.090
 refrigerated thing too but more 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.619
 reheated john mitchell the old 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.690
 coach all blacks this is the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.700
 new solid sail manager in 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.740
 defense his team takes little risk 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.390
 in attack but it is countered in 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.369
 early second period by chris 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.649
 masoe the third New Zealand line 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.350
 does not have 50 m sprinting in the legs 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.880
 it is resumed near the 22 m 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.830
 English tacklers are at fault 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.830
 penalty whistled by mister hodges 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.720
 with three more points all have it 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.720
 distant defensive bonus thresholds 14 to 6 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.909
 but then the Toulons do not arrive 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.260
 to take off they wait for them 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.540
 last five minutes to ensure 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.090
 definitely the victory after this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.310
 melee winner 12 points total for 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.780
 wilkinson 17 assists for toulon 17 to 6 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 it will be the final score 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.659
 despite this last action Toulon 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.700
 after the Sebastian siren lined up 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.560
 entered in place of michalak pierces the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.329
 defense of sail let him tend the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.329
 arm but it will be denied to the video 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.560
 with a little bit of efficiency we have 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.240
 three test opportunities that we could have 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.250
 we could have put the bottom in particular 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.410
 last where sebastian ac gave a 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.240
 support for to ensure the test but good 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.230
 the important thing was to win it was 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.420
 not the perfect match 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.580
 all in all I found that little that 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.010
 my team has mastered his subject yes 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.510
 without shining toulon has mastered his subject 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.100
 third victory in three matches 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.110
 european cup where wilkinson him to 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.120
 master the elements a weather 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 typical English which, on the other hand, 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.930
 not convinced the French to consider 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.930
 a new career in England 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.069
 so I preferred trained to miami for 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.069
 tell you the truth
