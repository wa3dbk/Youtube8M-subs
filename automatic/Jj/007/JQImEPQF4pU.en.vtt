00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 the blackberry q5 is the youngest 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.440
 member of the blackberry ten families in the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 compared to the q10 also with 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.240
 a qwerty keyboard is equipped 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.250
 it is a lot cheaper in the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 test reveals inside-mobile where the strengths 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:32.340
 and weaken the q5 lie despite 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.489
 Plastic housing makes the workmanship 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.960
 the q5 gives an excellent impression 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.910
 that is also because I at least 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.710
 the black model with its subtle 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 textured surface almost like 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 Made of metal, it feels weight and size 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.399
 a handy device will do that well in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.410
 the hand is the only something loose 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.329
 attached cover of the cards slots 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.550
 and the loveless one 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.629
 micro-usb connection over the outside 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.629
 Appearance of the q5 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.430
 blackberry 10 is different in 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.530
 some details from other mobile 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.050
 operating systems, for example, is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.729
 no home button needed to get out of one 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.909
 app on the homescreen back to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.909
 reach 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.320
 instead, a swipe gesture is made 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.119
 Bottom of the picture is made out of the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.259
 previously opened app will then be in one 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.770
 Overview of all active programs 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.570
 displayed a central component of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.790
 blackberry pull is the blackberry has 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.590
 here are all notifications in 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.320
 a list or sorted by 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.570
 different channels are displayed 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.910
 Blackberry app is by the wipe of 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.410
 down to the top and then to the right 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.840
 to reach out every app 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.039
 it is also possible to have a quick look 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.229
 to throw in the 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.229
 without leaving the current web 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.080
 the keyboard of the q5 does not quite offer 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.000
 the comfort of the q10 keyboard the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.300
 However, individual keys have 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.319
 a pleasant pressure point 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.150
 who is already typing that on one 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.650
 Touchscreen is used to 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.110
 Such a keyboard again 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.880
 get used to people with especially big ones 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.100
 Fingers could also have problems 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.100
 always the right letters to step 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.989
 the display has a good one 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.739
 resolution and turns colors brilliant 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.170
 and of course because it's wide enough around 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.500
 web pages especially mobile pages in 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.209
 sufficient size to represent 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.370
 video player does that well 5, however 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.570
 not a good figure 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.269
 due to the square display 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.930
 formats will feature 16 new videos 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.940
 large black bars displayed 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.620
 even in games, the form proves 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.620
 the display is very impractical 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.570
 Another drawback is that the camera 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.260
 this resolves with 5 megapixels and 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.209
 fabricates even with good 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.230
 often with pictures 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.230
 strong color noise 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.409
 actually, the blackberry q5 is one 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.389
 solid smartphone for users who are on 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.189
 put a physical keyboard value 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.019
 but you have to be very 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.599
 limited media functions in purchase 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.209
 you can also take from the camera 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.159
 do not expect too much 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.859
 blackberry 10 offers an effective and 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.750
 Intuitive operation actually that would be 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.519
 book five invariably as a working or 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.200
 to recommend business smartphone 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.430
 However, the battery life was synonymous 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.430
 not convincing in the test
