00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
this tree I didn't even think about that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
hopefully grass will grow on us if not

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.590 
hopefully grass will grow on us if not
start<00:00:50.660> working<00:00:51.020> on<00:00:51.140> getting<00:00:51.290> grass<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.920> move

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
start working on getting grass to move

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.810 
start working on getting grass to move
