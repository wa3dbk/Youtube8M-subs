00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
on blob action where you're jumping up

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and slamming the blob into the ground

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
and slamming the blob into the ground
and<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.509> bigger<00:02:00.780> blob<00:02:01.049> always<00:02:01.380> wins<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and so the bigger blob always wins so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.920 
and so the bigger blob always wins so

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
playing it it's a lot of fun how has

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.460 
playing it it's a lot of fun how has
been<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.730> develop<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:30.900> from<00:02:31.380> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
been like to develop like from from a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
been like to develop like from from a
simple<00:02:31.770> demo<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.670> something<00:02:32.820> more

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
simple demo to to something more

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.030 
simple demo to to something more
advanced<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.380> process<00:02:34.560> been

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
advanced like how was that process been

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.229 
advanced like how was that process been
it's<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.520> good<00:02:35.670> question<00:02:35.880> actually

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
it's a really good question actually

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.990 
it's a really good question actually
because<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.410> way<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> licensing<00:02:38.850> deal

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
because the way the licensing deal

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.630 
because the way the licensing deal
worked<00:02:39.330> was<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.890> actually<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.250> took

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
worked was that we actually just took

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.310 
worked was that we actually just took
the<00:02:41.820> concept<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.420> idea<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.870> rolling<00:02:43.230> around

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
the concept the idea of rolling around

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.260 
the concept the idea of rolling around
and<00:02:43.650> painting<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.040> city<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.820> original

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
and painting a city the original

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.120 
and painting a city the original
character<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.050> original<00:02:46.290> sort<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.890> world

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
character and the original sort of world

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.949 
character and the original sort of world
that<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> blog<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.630> something<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that the blog was in was something that

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.990 
that the blog was in was something that
we<00:02:49.140> actually<00:02:49.290> couldn't<00:02:49.650> use<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.820> had<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
we actually couldn't use so we had to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.699 
we actually couldn't use so we had to
build<00:02:51.239> everything<00:02:51.600> from<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.050> ground<00:02:52.290> up<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
build everything from the ground up and

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.870 
build everything from the ground up and
that's<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.070> one<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.550> beauties<00:02:53.820> of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
that's I think one of the beauties of

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.880 
that's I think one of the beauties of
designing<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> way<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
designing for the way is that you you

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.070 
designing for the way is that you you
build<00:02:56.160> everything<00:02:56.510> specifically<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.870> work

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
build everything specifically to work

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.440 
build everything specifically to work
with<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.440> control<00:02:58.920> switch<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.760> first

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
with that control switch so we first

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.420 
with that control switch so we first
I've<00:03:00.630> started<00:03:00.900> playing<00:03:01.709> around<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:02.130> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
I've started playing around with the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.949 
I've started playing around with the
gameplay<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.090> getting<00:03:03.330> him<00:03:03.420> working<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
gameplay and getting him working in a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.110 
gameplay and getting him working in a
whole<00:03:04.110> bunch<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.470> tests<00:03:04.739> situations<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> then

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
whole bunch of tests situations and then

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.670 
whole bunch of tests situations and then
the<00:03:06.209> next<00:03:06.239> thing<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.750> actually<00:03:06.930> defining<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the next thing was actually defining the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.340 
the next thing was actually defining the
new<00:03:07.830> art<00:03:08.070> style<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.870> everything<00:03:09.870> sort<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.170> come

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
new art style so everything sort of come

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.199 
new art style so everything sort of come

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.380 
crouched my lead artist they've just
done<00:03:37.769> such<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> fantastic<00:03:38.310> job<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.120> bring<00:03:39.239> it

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
done such a fantastic job to bring it

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.020 
done such a fantastic job to bring it
all<00:03:39.510> together<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.670> we<00:03:41.670> went<00:03:41.850> through

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
all together and I think we went through

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.850 
all together and I think we went through
about<00:03:42.150> eight<00:03:42.480> or<00:03:42.510> nine<00:03:42.720> iterations<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.680> what

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
about eight or nine iterations of what

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.199 
about eight or nine iterations of what
the<00:03:43.980> blob<00:03:44.190> looked<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.820> then<00:03:44.940> when<00:03:45.120> you

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
the blob looked like and then when you

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.759 
the blob looked like and then when you
see<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> final<00:03:45.840> result<00:03:46.170> he's<00:03:46.380> kind<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
see the final result he's kind of a

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.620 
see the final result he's kind of a
curious<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.489> interesting<00:03:48.000> character<00:03:48.420> my

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
curious and interesting character my

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.750 
curious and interesting character my
favorite<00:03:49.019> part<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.380> look<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:49.980> love<00:03:50.340> rolling

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
favorite part I look I just love rolling

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.190 
favorite part I look I just love rolling
around<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.269> painting<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.780> really<00:03:52.019> like

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
around and painting but I really like

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.840 
around and painting but I really like
getting<00:03:52.350> airborne<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.370> feeling<00:03:53.579> of

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
getting airborne I like that feeling of

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.520 
getting airborne I like that feeling of
total<00:03:54.090> freedom<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.810> flying<00:03:55.110> around<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
total freedom and flying around the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.050 
total freedom and flying around the
environment<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.880> something

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
environment I think that's something

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.630 
environment I think that's something
that<00:03:57.209> really<00:03:57.510> are<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.709> really<00:03:58.920> suits<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.459> way

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
that really are it really suits the way

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.940 
that really are it really suits the way
because<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.120> has<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.480> feeling<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.500> you're

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
because it has this feeling of you're

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.949 
because it has this feeling of you're
playing<00:04:02.310> with<00:04:02.459> something<00:04:02.730> very<00:04:03.090> fluid<00:04:03.570> very

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
playing with something very fluid very

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.020 
playing with something very fluid very
rubbery<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.530> yet<00:04:05.220> you're<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.489> total<00:04:05.880> control

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
rubbery and yet you're in total control

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.390 
rubbery and yet you're in total control
of<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:06.840> yeah<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.500> kind<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.829> new<00:04:07.980> it's<00:04:08.160> kind

worked really closely with them to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.810 
worked really closely with them to
develop<00:04:36.509> part<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.110> art<00:04:37.289> style<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.919> what

develop part of the art style and what

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.219 
develop part of the art style and what
is<00:04:39.090> really<00:04:39.360> good<00:04:39.539> is<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.810> they're<00:04:40.050> taking

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
is really good is that they're taking

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.990 
is really good is that they're taking
advantage<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.100> unique<00:04:41.130> elements<00:04:41.880> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
advantage of the unique elements that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
advantage of the unique elements that
the<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.419> d/s<00:04:42.720> has<00:04:42.960> as<00:04:43.139> well<00:04:43.320> so<00:04:43.530> there's<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.740> lot

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the the d/s has as well so there's a lot

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.430 
the the d/s has as well so there's a lot
of<00:04:43.919> really<00:04:44.669> cool<00:04:44.910> flicking<00:04:45.600> gameplay<00:04:46.139> and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
of really cool flicking gameplay and

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.840 
of really cool flicking gameplay and
you're<00:04:46.919> doing<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.250> same<00:04:47.430> thing<00:04:47.639> you're

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
you're doing the same thing you're

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.070 
you're doing the same thing you're
painting<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.240> city<00:04:48.449> but<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.870> very

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
painting a city but it's a very

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.080 
painting a city but it's a very
different<00:04:49.320> take<00:04:49.650> on<00:04:49.800> what<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.100> blob<00:04:50.310> is<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:50.820> I

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
different take on what the blob is so I

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.760 
different take on what the blob is so I
think<00:04:51.389> if<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:51.900> one<00:04:52.110> game<00:04:52.320> you'll<00:04:52.560> like

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
think if you like one game you'll like

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.129 
think if you like one game you'll like
the<00:04:52.889> other<00:04:53.039> so<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.940> that's<00:04:54.449> not<00:04:54.630> some<00:04:54.870> cheesy

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
the other so and that's not some cheesy
