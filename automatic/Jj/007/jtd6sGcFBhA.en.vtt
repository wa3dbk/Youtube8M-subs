00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.570
 Yes It is 2100 in the same mode field this also will introduce is the founder Bae this time here. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.440
 It is e 235 series Yamanote line 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:24.820
 This Plarail is already the third introduction in this 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.820
 Oh, it has not changed with the battle car 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.140
 Well Aikawara not it's not too cool 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.140
 I think that was also familiar than before to 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.280
 Yamate line is the latest model e 235 series 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 In this still entire surface has been reproduced in a little seal 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:54.200
 In the side is also not only in other changed nothing again of that green paint 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200
 Before and 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:05.129
 But I really wanted it if there was an e 231 series of the top car too 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.909
 As it is not this time, this e 233 series 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.909
 Does the vehicle body 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:20.090
 Well then you 're both car and vehicle 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:23.179
 This was remodeled from Sound e 231 series Yamanote Line 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 This front was used before 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:29.220
 e 233 series 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.220
 Is a modification of the screen of 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:40.700
 After all this mold is more realistic I would reproduce this e 235 system 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:46.840
 It 's a bit of a five-year six-door car that's just for thanks 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 I still decided to not mind anymore already because line 8 everyone is driving this 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 It was remodeled by not being able to go for a while 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.150
 The door opens properly 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:10.869
 It's like this. 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:15.239
 I thought that I thought I would try to remodel a little 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.239
 The origin is a guy like this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.590
 This Plarail also great good in the things that was released before the day more than the old days of sound 10 years ago, 10 years 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.590
 I think it's done 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.349
 Of course sound moves 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.210
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.460
 Sounds like this sounds like real sounds 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.420
 Good side 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:17.959
 It is said that Kaasaen &amp; stupid 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:21.160
 Also someday the sound of the 232310 series Yamanote line of the Sound Plarail will be completely recorded someday 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.160
 I think I want to do 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.319
 It is like this 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:37.860
 I'm glad the can there is no discomfort than I thought When viewed from the Tomei of unexpectedly'm Tan cat 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.780
 Also remodeling cyano But this combat vehicles in e 231 system someday 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.370
 I think that I want to support 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:49.850
 Sounds like this remodeled plastic is good this time 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.850
 e We introduced the 235 series Yamanote line.
