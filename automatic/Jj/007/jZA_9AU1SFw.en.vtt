three<00:02:06.610> who<00:02:06.939> was<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.330> way<00:02:07.450> they<00:02:07.540> used<00:02:07.720> to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
three who was the way they used to

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.390 
three who was the way they used to
it's<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:09.960> of<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.230> business<00:02:10.440> turned

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's the way of the business turned

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.660 
it's the way of the business turned
slightly<00:02:11.820> this<00:02:12.180> way<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.950> back<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.580> of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
slightly this way it's back to kind of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.580 
slightly this way it's back to kind of
the<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.880> they<00:02:14.970> are<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.380> cars

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the way they are but I think this cars

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.690 
the way they are but I think this cars
popular<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.340> Europe

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.420 

yeah<00:02:23.240> they<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.410> bigger<00:02:25.040> vehicles<00:02:25.910> over<00:02:26.150> here

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.000 

but<00:02:28.939> I<00:02:29.030> don't<00:02:29.180> find<00:02:29.329> it<00:02:29.450> small<00:02:29.739> step<00:02:30.739> into<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
but I don't find it small step into the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.780 
but I don't find it small step into the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
Turkish model of everything that's why

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.309 
Turkish model of everything that's why
your

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:57.820 

put<00:02:46.830> forward<00:02:47.099> before<00:02:47.760> where<00:02:48.120> else<00:02:48.299> go<00:02:48.510> huh

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.920 

the<00:02:58.280> transmission<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:58.850> great<00:02:59.150> though<00:02:59.570> the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
the transmission is great though the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
the transmission is great though the
transmission<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.500> really<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.220> get<00:03:01.400> automatic

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
transmission is really you get automatic

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.700 
transmission is really you get automatic
if<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.690> want<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.020> you<00:03:03.110> get<00:03:03.230> Sport<00:03:03.560> Automatic

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
if you want you you can do manual which

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.950 
if you want you you can do manual which
look<00:03:07.940> feels<00:03:08.300> like<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> manual<00:03:08.720> transmission

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
look feels like a manual transmission

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.340 
look feels like a manual transmission
doesn't<00:03:09.740> it<00:03:10.360> might<00:03:11.360> not<00:03:11.570> as<00:03:11.750> harsh<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.170> that

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
doesn't it might not as harsh is that

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.800 
doesn't it might not as harsh is that
manual<00:03:12.800> yeah<00:03:13.280> there<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:13.910> no<00:03:14.090> torque<00:03:14.360> converter

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
manual yeah there is no torque converter

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.890 
manual yeah there is no torque converter
so<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:16.010> big<00:03:16.310> plus

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
so that is a big plus

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.260 
so that is a big plus
there<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:17.990> no<00:03:18.200> power<00:03:19.070> eaten<00:03:19.610> up<00:03:19.730> by<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.970> torque

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
there is no power eaten up by the torque

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.580 
there is no power eaten up by the torque
converter

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
converter

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.920 
converter
yeah<00:03:22.590> he<00:03:22.980> acts<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.810> manual<00:03:24.810> shifter<00:03:25.260> but

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
yeah he acts like a manual shifter but

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.370 
yeah he acts like a manual shifter but
automatic<00:03:28.190> which<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.340> got<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.610> yeah<00:03:30.270> do<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:30.990> do

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
automatic which I got it yeah do it do

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.690 
automatic which I got it yeah do it do
it<00:03:31.410> clutching<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.160> sitting<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.670> my

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
it clutching and sitting there with my
