00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
so we'll just go from the black jacket

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.490 
so we'll just go from the black jacket
and<00:01:17.570> trace<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.150> darkness<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and trace around to the darkness on this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.630 
and trace around to the darkness on this
chin<00:01:24.890> pretty<00:01:25.890> simple

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.200 

and<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:30.300> just<00:01:30.570> eliminates<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.970> white

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and this just eliminates the the white

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.740 
and this just eliminates the the white
line<00:01:36.480> between<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> white<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> background

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
we'll just go ahead and erase this at

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.110 
we'll just go ahead and erase this at
the<00:01:45.720> bottom<00:01:45.990> we'll<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> magic<00:01:47.580> wand<00:01:47.610> and
