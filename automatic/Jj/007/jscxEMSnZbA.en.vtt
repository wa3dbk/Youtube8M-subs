00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.819
 Christian is with me and has the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 next issue of assassin's creed 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.040
 Of course it's all about 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.090
 syndicate what did you show 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.440
 they have indeed shown not even so much 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.820
 I still play a lot through this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.070
 better i was with evi means i think so 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 on the way or eve and had one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.609
 Of course templin kill and had me 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 for sneaking into the tower of london 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.260
 And it was a very young team 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.520
 again that you could choose 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.500
 how to proceed church key 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 I can free one who can help me 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 this building to come or tricks 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 in turn, from what I then made 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 I have an allied one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.770
 the interior lining of the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.300
 Villains had then brought there 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.890
 Let's pretend he's got me 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 caught and i can do my son this 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.590
 camp be that i put these temples in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.220
 could turn it off, everything played 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.530
 very very typical is it in street with 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 but I like these new features 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.470
 do not know if that fits so well 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.290
 This one launcher lifted these ropes 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:24.229
 Shoot up, pull up 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:26.909
 Hold on to batman and you can go with it 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 also merge it with the environment 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.799
 as if she had such a camouflage cap and man 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.960
 sneaks and then just stops 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.479
 she takes the contours of this 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.880
 environment and the opponents see 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.950
 Actually, they are certainly nice 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 gameplay elements I'm not yet 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.869
 so sure if that really 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.920
 suits assassin's creed big points 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.210
 which the developers also addressed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.590
 is that the fighting is so 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.180
 to feel a little different 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.619
 that one is now closer to the opponents 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.200
 no longer with schwertern what you there 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.759
 an impression of course gets 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.450
 I was discovered right away because I was 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 made me stupid 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.540
 it did not feel very bulky 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.530
 as with unity I found but otherwise it was 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.200
 also very very typical 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.209
 you have to be careful with him 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.350
 because she has her cane with this ball 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.440
 however to now I have not 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.150
 big differences noticed some go 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890
 keep in such a phase that you always 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.080
 block you can not attack easily 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.660
 must somehow otherwise call out 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.000
 lead that you can beat it but 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.920
 otherwise wait and see and wait 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.850
 that you get the button in time 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.830
 really pushes it down to this new one 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.570
 features just with the robot and such is 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.959
 It is very very typical Assassin's creed 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.840
 but without glitches dear unity friends 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.100
 So at least the presentation 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.870
 click now as it will not be the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.220
 making huge leaps it was something for 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.870
 you still interesting what would be 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
 now so your conclusion then in the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 end effect only for people of the series 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.819
 very loyal for a very long time anyway 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.959
 stay or maybe something at times 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.750
 We have to look in again longer 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.269
 I did not think so as well 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.850
 including assassin's creed fans can 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.830
 to get anyway they are also the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.590
 our conclusion probably does not matter 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.640
 and even so it all worked very well 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.140
 Pretty good, I think so 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 not that he debeaks this unity 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.209
 anyway want to repeat from that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.750
 that will be a good one or even one 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.350
 very good game and assassin's creed 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.890
 friends are accessing so it is 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.450
 you probably can not do that much 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.829
 do wrong and hopefully like in 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.700
 the presentation also in the release 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.700
 version bug free
