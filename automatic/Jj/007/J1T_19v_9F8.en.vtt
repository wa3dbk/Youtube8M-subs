we're<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> change<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.290> I'll<00:01:20.100> store

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
we're going to change that I'll store

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.270 
we're going to change that I'll store
this<00:01:20.670> right<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.740> we're<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> change<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this right here we're going to change it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.150 
this right here we're going to change it
to<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.429> 2<00:01:23.729> degree<00:01:23.929> side<00:01:24.929> bevel<00:01:25.289> angle<00:01:25.440> by

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
to a 2 degree side bevel angle by

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.150 
to a 2 degree side bevel angle by
applying<00:01:26.640> three<00:01:27.330> strips<00:01:27.720> onto<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.920> brass

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
applying three strips onto the brass

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.969 
applying three strips onto the brass
strip<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.729> provide<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> kit<00:01:30.679> then<00:01:31.679> we<00:01:31.800> just

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
strip to provide with a kit then we just

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.279 
strip to provide with a kit then we just
bend<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> strip's<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:33.229> like<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:36.289> that

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
bend the strip's around like so and that

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.760 
bend the strip's around like so and that
way<00:01:37.409> we'll<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:38.270> 1<00:01:39.270> degree<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.470> 2<00:01:40.649> degree

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
way we'll have a 1 degree and a 2 degree

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.180 
way we'll have a 1 degree and a 2 degree
strip<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.000> future<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.390> grinds<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.979> make

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
strip for future of grinds you can make

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.180 
strip for future of grinds you can make
whatever<00:01:44.399> combinations<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.330> want<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.920> now

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
whatever combinations you want and now

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.500 
whatever combinations you want and now
we're<00:01:47.340> ready<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.759> grind<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.479> side<00:01:48.659> edge

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.570 

so<00:01:52.440> again<00:01:52.650> we've<00:01:52.800> got<00:01:52.830> a<00:01:52.950> two<00:01:53.130> degree<00:01:53.250> bevel

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
so again we've got a two degree bevel

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.800 
so again we've got a two degree bevel
angle<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:55.190> our<00:01:56.190> stone<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.610> been<00:01:56.760> dressed<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
angle and our stone has been dressed and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
angle and our stone has been dressed and
we're<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.080> turn<00:01:58.230> it<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.830> likes

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
we're going to turn it up and it likes

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.000 
we're going to turn it up and it likes
to<00:01:59.250> run<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.610> around<00:01:59.960> 35,000<00:02:00.960> rpm<00:02:03.950> now<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
to run at around 35,000 rpm now we

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.930 
to run at around 35,000 rpm now we
simply<00:02:05.630> hold<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> against<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.230> edge

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.350 

make<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> smooth<00:02:14.980> easy<00:02:15.980> Glide

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.839 

there<00:02:23.010> finally<00:02:24.010> we<00:02:24.099> just<00:02:24.129> give<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.670> quick

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
there finally we just give it a quick

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.869 
there finally we just give it a quick
polish<00:02:25.470> with<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.500> gummy<00:02:26.769> stone<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.730> have

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
polish with the gummy stone and you have

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.660 
polish with the gummy stone and you have
a<00:02:30.909> very<00:02:31.239> very<00:02:31.540> sharp<00:02:31.870> smooth<00:02:32.440> edge<00:02:32.680> with<00:02:33.400> very
