00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
wizards so that's going to be a little

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150 
wizards so that's going to be a little
bit<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.480> a<00:01:24.570> problem<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:24.990> rage<00:01:25.320> spell<00:01:25.650> goes<00:01:25.860> in

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
bit of a problem here rage spell goes in

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.850 
bit of a problem here rage spell goes in
maybe<00:01:26.910> I<00:01:27.030> should<00:01:27.300> have<00:01:27.450> put<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.990> 11<00:01:28.440> dragons

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
maybe I should have put in 11 dragons

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
maybe I should have put in 11 dragons
and<00:01:29.070> some<00:01:29.430> barbarians<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.540> can

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and some barbarians just so they can

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
and some barbarians just so they can
fight<00:01:30.900> off<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.260> CC<00:01:31.830> so<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.370> got<00:01:32.490> nineteen

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
fight off that CC so we got nineteen

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
fight off that CC so we got nineteen
percent<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.270> looks<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.540> most<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> our

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
percent it looks like most of our

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.720 
percent it looks like most of our
dragons<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.380> heading<00:01:34.740> towards<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.370> center

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
dragons are heading towards the center

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.240 
dragons are heading towards the center
of<00:01:35.760> that<00:01:35.940> base<00:01:36.480> just<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.620> core<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of that base just right in that core and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.610 
of that base just right in that core and
our<00:01:38.670> heroes<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.390> mop<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.020> well<00:01:40.260> our
