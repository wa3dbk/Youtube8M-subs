bother I mean isn't this obvious why do
you<00:00:12.379> have<00:00:12.500> to<00:00:12.590> go<00:00:12.709> through<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.010> process<00:00:13.430> of

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
you have to go through the process of

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.269 
you have to go through the process of
economic<00:00:14.180> evaluation<00:00:14.869> of<00:00:15.019> nature<00:00:15.410> well<00:00:16.189> let

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
economic evaluation of nature well let

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.679 
economic evaluation of nature well let
me<00:00:16.309> try<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.610> address<00:00:16.790> that<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.240> you<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:17.509> then

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
also try and explain how it is to be

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.670 
also try and explain how it is to be
done<00:00:20.330> because<00:00:20.660> nature<00:00:21.439> is<00:00:21.560> something

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
done because nature is something

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.260 
done because nature is something
wondrous<00:00:22.039> it<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.369> our<00:00:22.490> only<00:00:22.669> home<00:00:22.939> it's<00:00:23.119> worth

wondrous it is our only home it's worth

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.960 
wondrous it is our only home it's worth
infinity<00:00:23.779> we<00:00:23.900> just<00:00:24.109> establish<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:24.910> why<00:00:25.910> do

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
infinity we just establish that why do

infinity we just establish that why do
you<00:00:26.060> need<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.269> put<00:00:26.420> value<00:00:26.929> to<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.170> ecosystem

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
you need to put value to the ecosystem

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.830 
you need to put value to the ecosystem
services<00:00:27.890> that<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:28.400> get<00:00:28.580> from<00:00:28.789> it<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.090> how<00:00:29.779> do

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
services that you get from it and how do

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.929 
services that you get from it and how do
you<00:00:29.960> do<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:30.590> in<00:00:31.039> simple<00:00:31.340> terms

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
you do this so in simple terms

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.850 
you do this so in simple terms
yes<00:00:32.540> it's<00:00:32.780> wondrous<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.320> it's<00:00:33.440> if<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.710> like

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
yes it's wondrous and it's if you like

yes it's wondrous and it's if you like
envision<00:00:34.820> there's<00:00:35.150> a<00:00:35.210> three<00:00:35.420> dimensional

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
envision there's a three dimensional

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.140 
envision there's a three dimensional
colorful<00:00:36.290> ball<00:00:36.500> my<00:00:37.460> colleagues<00:00:37.820> called<00:00:38.030> is

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
colorful ball my colleagues called is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.149 
colorful ball my colleagues called is
the<00:00:38.269> disco<00:00:38.660> sphere<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.559> figure<00:00:39.799> out<00:00:39.830> why<00:00:40.100> this

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
the disco sphere and figure out why this

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.539 
the disco sphere and figure out why this
is<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.750> but<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.989> problem<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.159> this<00:00:43.309> that

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:43.549 
is that but the problem is this that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:44.979 
is that but the problem is this that
you're<00:00:43.909> trying<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.330> measure<00:00:44.510> something<00:00:44.870> that

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
you're trying to measure something that

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.039 
you're trying to measure something that
is<00:00:45.080> multi-dimensional<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:46.489> an<00:00:47.210> axis<00:00:47.750> which<00:00:47.930> is

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
is multi-dimensional in an axis which is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:49.689 
is multi-dimensional in an axis which is
a<00:00:48.080> single<00:00:48.409> dimensional<00:00:48.830> axis<00:00:48.979> is<00:00:49.280> essentially

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
a single dimensional axis is essentially

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.460 
a single dimensional axis is essentially
the<00:00:49.820> dollar<00:00:50.000> axis<00:00:50.360> if<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:50.570> like<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:51.080> economic

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
the dollar axis if you like the economic

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.340 
the dollar axis if you like the economic
value<00:00:51.619> and<00:00:52.360> if<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.449> don't<00:00:53.720> then<00:00:54.080> there<00:00:54.260> will

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
value and if you don't then there will

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.750 
value and if you don't then there will
be<00:00:54.379> other<00:00:54.650> things<00:00:54.769> there<00:00:55.159> will<00:00:55.250> be<00:00:55.280> other<00:00:55.489> uses

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
be other things there will be other uses

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.060 
be other things there will be other uses
of<00:00:56.089> land<00:00:56.330> which<00:00:56.839> are<00:00:57.019> measured<00:00:57.379> in<00:00:57.619> economic

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
of land which are measured in economic

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.520 
of land which are measured in economic
value<00:00:58.100> terms<00:00:58.549> and<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:59.600> will<00:00:59.780> result<00:01:00.080> in<00:01:00.260> trade

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
value terms and it will result in trade

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.130 
value terms and it will result in trade
off<00:01:00.680> choices<00:01:01.189> which<00:01:01.640> means<00:01:02.299> that<00:01:02.720> nature

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
off choices which means that nature

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.810 
off choices which means that nature
would<00:01:03.260> be<00:01:03.409> destroyed<00:01:03.799> while<00:01:04.250> nature<00:01:04.580> would<00:01:04.699> be

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
would be destroyed while nature would be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.120 
would be destroyed while nature would be
replaced<00:01:05.269> by<00:01:05.540> built<00:01:05.780> areas<00:01:06.200> by<00:01:06.470> by

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
this mystical stuff which you don't put

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.529 
this mystical stuff which you don't put
a<00:01:30.710> value<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.789> balance<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.299> need<00:01:32.420> to

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
a value to to balance that you need to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.779 
a value to to balance that you need to
measure<00:01:32.719> nature's<00:01:33.619> services<00:01:34.100> into<00:01:34.310> society

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
measure nature's services into society

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.730 
measure nature's services into society
and<00:01:34.999> then<00:01:35.719> when<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:35.990> do<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:36.560> actually

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
and then when you do that and actually

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.440 
and then when you do that and actually
present<00:01:37.189> two<00:01:37.490> sides<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.819> the<00:01:37.909> coin<00:01:37.939> your

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
present two sides of the coin your

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.469 
present two sides of the coin your
choice<00:01:38.689> can<00:01:38.869> be<00:01:38.990> quite<00:01:39.170> different<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:40.420> want<00:01:41.420> to

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
choice can be quite different I want to

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.910 
choice can be quite different I want to
give<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.780> small<00:01:42.020> example<00:01:42.289> of<00:01:42.499> this<00:01:42.679> small

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
give a small example of this small

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.889 
give a small example of this small
because<00:01:43.189> it<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> locational<00:01:44.030> very<00:01:44.420> specific

example<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.469> comes<00:01:45.710> from<00:01:45.890> South<00:01:46.249> Island

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
example this comes from South Island

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.700 
example this comes from South Island
this<00:01:47.569> is<00:01:47.780> about<00:01:48.109> a<00:01:48.380> shrimp<00:01:49.100> farm<00:01:49.429> which<00:01:50.710> arose

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
this is about a shrimp farm which arose

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.679 
this is about a shrimp farm which arose
from<00:01:51.889> a<00:01:52.009> mangrove<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.609> in<00:01:52.999> fact<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.359> applies

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
from a mangrove and in fact this applies

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.649 
from a mangrove and in fact this applies
to<00:01:53.719> a<00:01:54.020> particular<00:01:54.409> area<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.829> South<00:01:55.069> Island<00:01:55.460> so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
to a particular area in South Island so

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.879 
to a particular area in South Island so
economically<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.960> logic<00:01:57.259> was<00:01:57.439> very<00:01:57.649> clear

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
economically the logic was very clear

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.849 
economically the logic was very clear

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.680 
leave the forest as it is the mangrove

well that's eight thousand dollars so if

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.940 
well that's eight thousand dollars so if

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
basically destroyed that land so you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.540 
basically destroyed that land so you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.130 
need to redo the whole area that cost

much cyclonic damage they suffered

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.000 
much cyclonic damage they suffered
versus<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.540> others<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.590> works<00:03:21.800> out<00:03:21.950> to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
versus the others and that works out to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.080 
versus the others and that works out to
something<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.340> twelve<00:03:22.670> thousand<00:03:22.910> dollars

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
something like twelve thousand dollars

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.790 
something like twelve thousand dollars
now<00:03:23.540> look<00:03:23.810> at<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.990> trade-off<00:03:24.290> choice<00:03:24.530> and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
now look at the trade-off choice and

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.950 
now look at the trade-off choice and
this<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.460> the<00:03:25.550> whole<00:03:25.670> point<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:26.570> if<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.780> look

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
this is the whole point that if you look

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.140 
this is the whole point that if you look
at<00:03:27.020> public<00:03:27.500> wealth<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:28.070> include<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.910> in

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
at public wealth and include that in

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.970 
at public wealth and include that in
your<00:03:29.180> trade-off<00:03:29.660> decisions<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.950> a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
your trade-off decisions you get to a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980 
your trade-off decisions you get to a
completely<00:03:31.580> different<00:03:31.730> answer<00:03:32.090> then<00:03:32.780> if<00:03:32.900> you

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
completely different answer then if you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.960 
completely different answer then if you
simply<00:03:33.410> looked<00:03:33.950> at<00:03:34.040> private<00:03:34.400> profits<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
simply looked at private profits and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.360 
simply looked at private profits and
worked<00:03:35.600> your<00:03:35.720> your<00:03:36.440> trade<00:03:36.770> off<00:03:36.920> choice<00:03:37.160> on

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
worked your your trade off choice on

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.590 
worked your your trade off choice on
that<00:03:37.400> basis<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.030> fact<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.330> get<00:03:38.480> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
that basis you in fact you get the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.660 
that basis you in fact you get the
opposite<00:03:38.990> answer<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.740> get<00:03:39.890> conversion<00:03:40.520> as

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
opposite answer you get conversion as

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.790 
opposite answer you get conversion as
the<00:03:40.790> right<00:03:40.940> economic<00:03:41.150> choice<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.810> not<00:03:42.110> sorry

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
the right economic choice and not sorry

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.930 
the right economic choice and not sorry
you<00:03:42.890> get<00:03:43.040> conservation<00:03:43.640> as<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.820> right

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
you get conservation as the right

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.070 
you get conservation as the right
economic<00:03:44.090> choice<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.660> not<00:03:44.780> kind<00:03:44.900> of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
economic choice and not kind of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.940 
economic choice and not kind of
conversion<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.320> this<00:03:48.470> just<00:03:48.710> an<00:03:48.830> isolated

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
conversion so is this just an isolated

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.910 
conversion so is this just an isolated
example<00:03:49.820> from<00:03:49.970> some<00:03:50.240> small<00:03:50.690> community<00:03:51.410> area

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
example from some small community area

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.080 
example from some small community area
and<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.220> southern<00:03:52.640> coast<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:53.000> Thailand<00:03:53.180> no<00:03:53.600> a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
and the southern coast of Thailand no a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.580 
and the southern coast of Thailand no a
calculation<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.210> much<00:03:56.420> bigger<00:03:56.870> calculation

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
calculation a much bigger calculation

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.470 
calculation a much bigger calculation
like<00:03:57.770> this<00:03:57.950> has<00:03:58.220> been<00:03:58.250> done<00:03:58.460> by<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> group<00:03:59.240> in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
like this has been done by a group in

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.360 
like this has been done by a group in
the<00:03:59.750> UK<00:03:59.900> research<00:04:00.530> group<00:04:00.770> called<00:04:00.980> true<00:04:01.130> cost

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
the UK research group called true cost

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.950 
the UK research group called true cost
and<00:04:01.610> their<00:04:02.150> numbers<00:04:02.450> were<00:04:02.540> quite<00:04:02.720> staggering

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
and their numbers were quite staggering

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.950 
and their numbers were quite staggering
they<00:04:03.590> worked<00:04:03.800> out<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.670> so-called

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
they worked out that the so-called

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.240 
they worked out that the so-called
externalities<00:04:05.960> in<00:04:06.140> other<00:04:06.260> words<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.770> cost<00:04:07.040> to

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
externalities in other words the cost to

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.250 
externalities in other words the cost to
society<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.790> normal<00:04:08.480> business<00:04:08.600> by

freshwater<00:04:24.230> externality<00:04:24.800> all<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.250> these

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
freshwater externality all of these

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.580 
freshwater externality all of these
added<00:04:25.760> up<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.090> pollution<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.780> on<00:04:26.900> all<00:04:27.410> of

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
added up and pollution and so on all of

these added up according to them are

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.530 
these added up according to them are
something<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:30.400> 2.25<00:04:31.400> trillion<00:04:32.030> dollars

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
something like 2.25 trillion dollars

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.239 
something like 2.25 trillion dollars
that's

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:34.249 
that's

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.279 
that's
a<00:04:34.339> huge<00:04:34.759> number<00:04:34.909> fine<00:04:35.749> but<00:04:35.959> it's<00:04:36.109> also

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
a huge number fine but it's also

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.739 
a huge number fine but it's also
interestingly<00:04:37.039> enough<00:04:37.579> a<00:04:37.759> third<00:04:38.119> almost<00:04:38.629> a

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:38.749 
interestingly enough a third almost a

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:40.269 
interestingly enough a third almost a
third<00:04:39.019> of<00:04:39.049> the<00:04:39.379> profits<00:04:39.769> of<00:04:39.889> those<00:04:40.069> three

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:40.279 
third of the profits of those three

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.339 
third of the profits of those three
thousand<00:04:40.609> corporations<00:04:41.119> and<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:42.229> can

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
thousand corporations and you can

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.629 
thousand corporations and you can
imagine<00:04:42.499> that<00:04:42.829> this<00:04:42.979> is<00:04:43.039> three<00:04:43.309> thousand

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
imagine that this is three thousand

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.679 
imagine that this is three thousand
corporations<00:04:44.089> so<00:04:44.179> there<00:04:44.329> will<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.449> some

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
corporations so there will be some

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.809 
corporations so there will be some
corporations<00:04:45.229> where<00:04:45.499> their<00:04:46.039> externalities

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
corporations where their externalities

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.849 
corporations where their externalities
which<00:04:46.849> means<00:04:47.329> their<00:04:47.809> cost<00:04:48.049> to<00:04:48.199> society<00:04:48.349> of

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:48.859 
which means their cost to society of

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:50.769 
which means their cost to society of
doing<00:04:49.249> normal<00:04:49.669> business<00:04:49.969> are<00:04:50.179> actually

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:50.779 
doing normal business are actually

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.269 
doing normal business are actually
higher<00:04:51.049> than<00:04:51.349> the<00:04:51.679> profits<00:04:52.039> that<00:04:52.099> they

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:52.279 
higher than the profits that they

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.859 
higher than the profits that they
generate<00:04:52.609> now<00:04:53.059> is<00:04:53.209> that<00:04:53.359> a<00:04:53.389> good<00:04:53.599> business

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:53.869 
generate now is that a good business

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:57.069 
generate now is that a good business

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
a few years it's destroyed a lot more

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.769 
a few years it's destroyed a lot more
value<00:05:00.769> than<00:05:00.799> its<00:05:01.069> created<00:05:01.459> hmm<00:05:01.939> can<00:05:02.569> you<00:05:02.599> keep

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779 
value than its created hmm can you keep

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.539 
value than its created hmm can you keep
doing<00:05:02.839> that<00:05:03.139> No<00:05:03.499> and<00:05:03.679> that's<00:05:04.249> really<00:05:04.459> the

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:04.549 
doing that No and that's really the

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:05.799 
doing that No and that's really the
challenge<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:05.089> that's<00:05:05.299> the<00:05:05.449> challenge<00:05:05.779> that

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:05.809 
challenge and that's the challenge that

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.139 
challenge and that's the challenge that
corporations<00:05:06.469> have<00:05:06.649> to<00:05:06.799> address<00:05:06.949> and<00:05:07.279> we<00:05:07.879> as

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:08.149 
corporations have to address and we as
