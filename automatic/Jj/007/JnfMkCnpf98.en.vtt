 the members of the yakuza 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.140
 arena 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.849
 I 'd like to hear from you first. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.650
 how was the preparation routine for 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.180
 you get here yourself 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.730
 mentioned that he was one of the new members 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.610
 From the team to you was of videos introsar 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.670
 Or was it quiet, the crew stayed rather 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 It was quiet the people helped a lot and 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.430
 I got in easy and we trained three 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.959
 weeks only and for a short time the result 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.660
 it's huge 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.049
 I believed that our team was good. 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.940
 understood 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.370
 I knew I trusted that we would win. 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.560
 and gave no other 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.209
 and what is the feeling of playing against 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.799
 favoritism of the galera yourself 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.670
 mentioned that I think I was the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.260
 favorite 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.629
 You arrived and emailed me timidly. 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.430
 for some and they ended up leaving champions 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.760
 this gives you an extra strength to the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.640
 upcoming championships and how help is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.430
 an extra force that the crew will start 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.750
 to support the team more 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.120
 it's a normal tactic I in my old 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.889
 club and they were not always their clan 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.030
 I played against tim hill 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.940
 it's not a seven-headed creature 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.310
 It lacked the organization and friendship that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.590
 people have so this is it 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.000
 and finally with its next goals has 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.829
 more championships in view of the formation 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.790
 remains the same for the next 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.359
 disputes 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.269
 the training will be the same as the next 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.069
 goal without doubt is a world of bbc 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.470
 maybe from there maybe it should be the next 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.930
 event and large blanc will have the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 our goal is to have won the schalke 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.889
 people are staying and keep an eye on 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.889
