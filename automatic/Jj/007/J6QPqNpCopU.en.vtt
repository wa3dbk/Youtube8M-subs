00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:29.189
 the tensiometer we have in 3 power the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.119
 Metro the 10 km2 10k and where and two 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.200
 trucks 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.230
 my car here vote using one more one 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.940
 10k because I have not found a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.160
 22 pot potentiometer 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.020
 this thesis here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.130
 She has three legs so how's it going? 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.050
 We'll plug her into our circuit and 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.050
 Yes, I'm really going to zoom in here. 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.130
 this is the strongest p3 is the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.720
 potential the volume subway 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.550
 imagine that you will be with him here 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.100
 It is thus in the three legs that the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.970
 is 10k 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.780
 How are we going to call in there? 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:39.470
 board nÃ© tv got these three dots 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:42.710
 that three teams, right? 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.220
 the perforations here are these three 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.220
 here o 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:58.100
 I liked to see how it goes 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:03.130
 make the connection e63 drizzle here 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.130
 first this one we'll call the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 medium 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:17.660
 connected in the middle 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:22.040
 the second is to be connected in the first and 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.450
 last is to be connected here 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:31.969
 power pot here 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:36.109
 this one here and here 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:42.709
 This one here is not much 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:45.109
 problem will not give a cut of 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.670
 front right upper room that has more 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:52.819
 two tensions 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:58.450
 this is responsible for the volume 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.450
 and if from here the pulse calibration 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.790
 on here 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:19.860
 so now you will potentially come back 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:22.950
 so let's go there and they'll call you 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.270
 here is this one and this and that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:34.980
 here you only have three 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:49.730
 So it's going to be this and that 's the other one going. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:54.590
 to be here also hiding there to them 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.990
 the first one here will connect us 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.400
 first here at first with one here 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.010
 this one is 10 cars if you have 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.790
 112 you will be in this one and you think 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.040
 that I am near took the first 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:17.609
 so we call on the first leg 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.820
 here the potential the second wave 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.040
 potential leg 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.710
 now it's only a dot is how it is 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.700
 We'll do it and we'll call this one. 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.490
 O 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:38.040
 in this other potential and then this one here 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:41.360
 in this other here and then the latter 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.550
 here we read here 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.190
 right then that there is not much 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.200
 secret is not 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.050
 attention I 'll stay like this 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.440
 only on this premise here have the teams 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.630
 Come here and I'm yours. 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.630
 take a photo and power the subway 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.590
 ah
