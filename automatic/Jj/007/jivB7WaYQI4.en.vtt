00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.460
 it's something that nobody has done at least 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.619
 I do not have knowledge of a municipality 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.379
 has been launched to do this that goes what 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.970
 what are we going to do here in Providencia 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.610
 Thus 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.200
 and I think he always believes always believed 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.980
 of training do and always do better 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.230
 do what 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 and it seems very remarkable to me that from a 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.059
 municipality arise this concern and not 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.170
 just come up and say we already want 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.730
 do this but also say 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 we want to do this we do not know how to do 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.470
 then we call other organizations 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.900
 they do know how to do and we all get together 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.269
 and we do and we do it and for us 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.030
 It's a great opportunity to participate in a 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.650
 project as inclusive as this one 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.050
 aims to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.870
 and demonstrate in a practical way and 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.000
 simple the impact that the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.250
 urban agriculture in the common citizen 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 and current and also from the point of 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.700
 therapeutic view and development of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 social synergy 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.610
 city 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.010
 and I find that this project has a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.830
 great potential to do 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.080
 somehow a public use and 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.850
 positive of these sites that are of 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.230
 these aisles that are lost in the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.740
 city I think those are a little bit my 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.720
 expectations that we can measure what happens 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.750
 because it always remains as in fear 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.910
 of not that a site eriazo is not that it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.410
 are going to put the bums to bibi is not that 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.840
 new function always the negative is 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.200
 test ahead then power 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.180
 dare to try and do it and measure and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.730
 see if it works or does not work 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.640
 direct benefit is that they come to be 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.030
 green lungs or meeting lungs 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.950
 not only from the point of view 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.590
 environmental but also from the point of 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.860
 community view is a place of 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.790
 endless possibilities is a place that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.110
 let's say within the city with the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.690
 physiognomy of the city finds a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.300
 design finds an activity 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.640
 totally different that disconnects it from 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.220
 that crazy dynamism that has and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 also highlights a site that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.580
 Is abandoned 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.069
 and says we're not going to build a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.200
 building we are going to build green area 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.430
 the green area has a value and that value 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.430
 the green area nobody 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.209
 I'm going to her 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.560
 I'm going to the garden take me to the garden
