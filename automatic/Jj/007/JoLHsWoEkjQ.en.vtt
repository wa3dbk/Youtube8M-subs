00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
yeah 20 visitors Victor's a lot and I'm

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.650 
yeah 20 visitors Victor's a lot and I'm
forgetting<00:00:05.370> about<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.940> experiment<00:00:06.569> right

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
forgetting about this experiment right

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.520 
forgetting about this experiment right
here<00:00:06.919> so<00:00:07.919> as<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.610> experiment<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.599> from

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
here so as this experiment is from

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.100 
here so as this experiment is from
tornadoes<00:00:10.950> cloud<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.730> water<00:00:12.000> cycle<00:00:12.269> so

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
tornadoes cloud in the water cycle so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.129 
tornadoes cloud in the water cycle so
the<00:00:13.889> here<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> steps<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.969> create<00:00:15.360> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the here are the steps to create this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.590 
the here are the steps to create this
experiment<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.029> put<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.210> couple

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
experiment right here so put a couple

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
experiment right here so put a couple
drops<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.990> food<00:00:19.199> coloring<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.920> should<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
drops of food coloring it should be a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.980 
drops of food coloring it should be a
dark<00:00:21.210> color<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.439> glass<00:00:23.180> which<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.420> which

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
dark color into a glass which is which

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.910 
dark color into a glass which is which
is<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.439> right<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:28.590> after

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
is this one right here so and then after

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.209 
is this one right here so and then after
that<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.400> put<00:00:29.609> more<00:00:29.970> water<00:00:30.720> into<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.830> same

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that you put more water into that same

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.180 
that you put more water into that same
gas<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.160> take

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gas so there what you do is you take

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.490 
gas so there what you do is you take
another<00:00:35.579> glass<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.600> your<00:00:36.690> cold<00:00:36.899> water<00:00:37.170> oh

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
another glass for your cold water oh

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.770 
another glass for your cold water oh
yeah<00:00:38.040> I'd<00:00:38.219> both<00:00:38.489> hot<00:00:39.030> water<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> cold<00:00:39.660> water

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
yeah I'd both hot water and cold water

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.229 
yeah I'd both hot water and cold water
both<00:00:40.140> masses<00:00:40.559> missile<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> brim<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.059> put

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
both masses missile to the brim you put

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.049 
both masses missile to the brim you put
a<00:00:42.270> speaker<00:00:42.540> card<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> hot<00:00:43.379> water

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
a speaker card we're on the hot water

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.750 
a speaker card we're on the hot water
next<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.170> she<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:46.950> adult<00:00:47.190> ja<00:00:47.460> so

don't try this alone unless you're at
all<00:00:50.430> obviously<00:00:51.320> entered<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.070> hot<00:00:53.280> water

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
all obviously entered the hot water

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090 
all obviously entered the hot water
carefully<00:00:53.820> over<00:00:54.210> onto<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> cold<00:00:55.050> water<00:00:55.260> make

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
carefully over onto the cold water make

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.160 
carefully over onto the cold water make
sure<00:00:56.340> both<00:00:56.910> classes<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.660> fail<00:00:58.309> arrest<00:00:59.309> one

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
sure both classes are we fail arrest one

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.420 
sure both classes are we fail arrest one
they<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.379> when<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> fit<00:01:01.800> together<00:01:02.100> again

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
they want when you fit together again

moon DS benefit they have x2 equal
classes<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.220> ease<00:01:14.430> flip<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.330> over<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
classes at ease flip it over and then

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
classes at ease flip it over and then
then<00:01:18.150> carefully<00:01:18.740> pull<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> cord<00:01:20.220> cord<00:01:20.460> out

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
then carefully pull the cord cord out

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.420 
then carefully pull the cord cord out
without<00:01:21.570> having<00:01:21.780> any<00:01:22.020> water<00:01:22.259> follow<00:01:22.560> rubik<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
without having any water follow rubik of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.399 
without having any water follow rubik of
course<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:24.150> water<00:01:24.360> fall<00:01:24.689> over<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.200> see

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
course our water fall over like you see

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.280 
course our water fall over like you see
here<00:01:25.439> show<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> card<00:01:26.460> code<00:01:26.670> yeah<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
here show the card code yeah and this is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
here show the card code yeah and this is
a<00:01:28.320> power<00:01:28.590> board<00:01:28.829> asked<00:01:29.310> after<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a power board asked after you use it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
a power board asked after you use it
will<00:01:30.659> probably<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.290> short<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> glass

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
will probably be short on the glass

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
will probably be short on the glass
after<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.299> view<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> looks<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.630> now

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
after a view sure what it looks like now

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
after a view sure what it looks like now
flip<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> over<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.560> course<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> do

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
flip it over of course but when you do

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
flip it over of course but when you do
undertake<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.780> course<00:01:39.990> some<00:01:40.170> water

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
undertake it out of course some water

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
undertake it out of course some water
forget<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.990> well<00:01:44.030> next<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
forget about it and well next you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.790 
forget about it and well next you
observe<00:01:45.750> what's<00:01:45.990> happening<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.070> see

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
right here because the hot water

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.830 
right here because the hot water
represents<00:01:57.100> warming<00:01:57.850> they're<00:01:58.210> both<00:01:58.510> of<00:01:58.750> which

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
represents warming they're both of which

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
represents warming they're both of which
is<00:01:58.990> cool<00:01:59.140> water<00:01:59.440> isn't<00:01:59.680> calling<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:01.110> arrogance

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
is cool water isn't calling it arrogance

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.580 
is cool water isn't calling it arrogance
get<00:02:04.270> warmer<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.080> bottom<00:02:05.530> represents<00:02:05.890> goalie

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.490 

so<00:02:11.590> if<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.980> want<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.370> skip<00:02:12.520> khodam<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.780> and

then warrior rises until a corner next

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.270 
then warrior rises until a corner next
to<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.270> ba<00:02:19.420> cool<00:02:19.660> air<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.590> floor<00:02:20.920> there<00:02:21.130> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
to be ba cool air and the floor there is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.490 
to be ba cool air and the floor there is
not<00:02:21.760> above<00:02:22.330> from<00:02:22.660> there<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:25.209> queer<00:02:25.540> forces<00:02:26.410> it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
not above from there the queer forces it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.220 
not above from there the queer forces it
to<00:02:26.530> go<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.280> says<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:28.540> better<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:29.080> up

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
to go like it says you better go up

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.440 
to go like it says you better go up
there<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.430> isn't<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> thought

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
there but it isn't like to be a thought

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.370 
there but it isn't like to be a thought
for<00:02:32.260> example<00:02:33.270> well<00:02:34.270> glass<00:02:34.510> Iraq<00:02:34.900> talk<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.350> a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
for example well glass Iraq talk to a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.620 
for example well glass Iraq talk to a
person's<00:02:35.890> at<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> bottom<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.300> person

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
person's at the bottom and the person

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.320 
person's at the bottom and the person
another<00:02:37.930> person<00:02:38.200> was<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.500> at<00:02:38.620> all<00:02:39.330> so

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
another person was to get at all so

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.699 
another person was to get at all so
pretend<00:02:40.570> this<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.810> warm<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.440> cold

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
pretend this is warm and this is cold

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.699 
pretend this is warm and this is cold
air<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.420> then<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> war<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.350> at<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> bottom

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
air and then to the war is at the bottom

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.610 
air and then to the war is at the bottom
the<00:02:45.040> polio<00:02:45.310> as<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> talk<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.330> war<00:02:46.540> where<00:02:46.840> says<00:02:47.350> I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the polio as a talk the war where says I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.490 
the polio as a talk the war where says I
want<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> cap<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.840> coiler<00:02:50.200> says

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
want to be a cap so that the coiler says

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.370 
want to be a cap so that the coiler says
our<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.459> by<00:02:51.670> them<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.239> they<00:02:52.420> do<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.170> what<00:02:53.290> if

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
our get by them so they do so what if

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.920 
our get by them so they do so what if
force<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.100> down<00:02:54.400> or<00:02:54.730> pushes<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.450> hot<00:02:55.780> air

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
force is it down or pushes the hot air

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.270 
force is it down or pushes the hot air
on<00:02:56.110> oh<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.890> actually<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.790> also<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.769> opposed<00:03:03.100> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
on oh so actually it also so opposed the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.319 
on oh so actually it also so opposed the
war<00:03:03.310> realize<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:05.769> cause<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.549> aired<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:07.090> are

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
war realize this cause is aired we are

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.930 
war realize this cause is aired we are
stable<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:09.070> causes<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.430> air<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.730> be

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
stable this causes the air to be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.190 
stable this causes the air to be
completely<00:03:10.269> unstable<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:12.780> what

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
completely unstable like what

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.140 
completely unstable like what
which<00:03:15.200> results<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.890> understood<00:03:16.579> so<00:03:16.879> as<00:03:17.120> you

which results in understood so as you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.360 
which results in understood so as you
see<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.959> imagine<00:03:18.650> at<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:19.040> thunder

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
see you imagine at this is thunder

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.789 
see you imagine at this is thunder
storms<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.879> these<00:03:20.030> are<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.269> clouds<00:03:20.799> thank

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
storms and these are the clouds thank

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.949 
storms and these are the clouds thank
you<00:03:21.950> for<00:03:22.129> listening<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:23.420> my<00:03:23.569> science
