00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.420 
not a lot at all so the odds of you
actually<00:03:47.970> owning<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.600> computer<00:03:49.290> are<00:03:49.590> very<00:03:50.130> slim

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
actually owning a computer are very slim

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.390 
actually owning a computer are very slim
very<00:03:50.790> very<00:03:51.240> slim<00:03:51.620> however<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> other<00:03:53.100> hand

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
very very slim however on the other hand

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.300 
very very slim however on the other hand
your<00:03:54.000> access<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.170> computer<00:03:55.350> on<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.950> global

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
your access to a computer on the global

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.490 
your access to a computer on the global
chat<00:03:56.550> on<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.820> global<00:03:57.390> scale<00:03:57.600> is<00:03:57.960> about<00:03:58.170> three

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
chat on a global scale is about three

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.150 
chat on a global scale is about three
times<00:03:58.740> better<00:03:59.730> than<00:04:00.090> owning<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:01.050> computer<00:04:01.500> so

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
times better than owning a computer so

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.560 
times better than owning a computer so
it<00:04:02.310> goes<00:04:02.430> from<00:04:02.520> four<00:04:02.790> percent<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.270> twelve

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
it goes from four percent to twelve

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.090 
it goes from four percent to twelve
percent<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.110> twelve<00:04:04.590> percent<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.980> people

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
percent so twelve percent of people

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.270 
percent so twelve percent of people
around<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.270> world<00:04:06.500> have<00:04:07.500> access<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
