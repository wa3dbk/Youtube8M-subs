00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.010
 contraindications most of 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.930
 we have tried it once and 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.210
 today we will try to clarify one of the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.550
 most known myths related to the

 world of sports and health the sauna 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.920
 from gas to myth or reality the first thing that 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.260
 we must know is that there are different 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.960
 types of saunas and each one has its 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.329
 corresponding properties the most 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.780
 known is the Finnish or dry sauna 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 although there are also Turkish baths 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.039
 also called wet sauna or love 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.739
 differences between Finnish saunas and 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.080
 Turkish bath the Finnish sauna is a 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.119
 untreated wooden cabin so that 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.910
 the wood can absorb the moisture that 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.280
 there may be too many banks 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.110
 at different heights being in the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.550
 higher where it concentrates more 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.040
 temperature as 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.440
 and heat goes up a heater 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.930
 electric is responsible for providing the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.090
 temperature that ranges between 70 100 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.910
 degrees centigrade and also contains 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.370
 volcanic stones where when pouring water 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.740
 it causes a blow of steam the bathroom 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.620
 Turkish instead provides moist heat 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.900
 by water vapor the temperature 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.410
 it's lower than the dry sauna swinging 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.570
 between 25 to 50 degrees according to the height 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.000
 environment is saturated with water vapor 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.790
 which prevents sweating process 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.520
 so in the Turkish bath you sweat less 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.370
 that in the Finnish sauna the sauna of the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 gas in today's society obsession 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.110
 for an aesthetic canon comes to create 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.290
 myths like the one we treat today the sauna 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.270
 from gas to myth or reality the need 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.730
 of getting a nice body and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 lose weight makes the number of people 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.550
 who want to lose weight increase steps 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.040
 The main problem is that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.080
 many times the weight loss is 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.060
 want to perform without practicing just 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.950
 sport and without taking into account 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.319
 calories or saturated fats that we eat 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.720
 and yes it is true that in the sauna 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.670
 it produces a sweat and if we weigh ourselves 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.610
 after a session we will see that we have 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.800
 reduced weight but eye thin 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.590
 because our body is subdued 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.420
 at those temperatures you lose water so 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.940
 that the moment we start to 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.010
 hydrate we will recover the liquids 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.530
 lost and we will not have lost weight 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.080
 absolutely nothing to lose weight is 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.030
 necessary to burn fat and in the sauna is 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 impossible since we will only eliminate 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.150
 toxins through sweat benefits 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.160

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.799

 combat insomnia and stress though 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.000
