internet out of how to do a rubix cube
and<00:00:12.630> they<00:00:12.690> used<00:00:13.400> algorithms<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.700> seemed<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and they used algorithms and it seemed a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.060 
and they used algorithms and it seemed a
bit<00:00:15.030> confusing<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.900> me<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> want<00:00:17.039> to

do is I want to make a three-part video
on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> cube<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
on the way that I do the cube the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.740 
on the way that I do the cube the
hardest<00:00:23.490> part<00:00:23.609> about<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.029> cube<00:00:24.240> isn't<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
hardest part about the cube isn't so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
hardest part about the cube isn't so
much<00:00:24.830> getting<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.859> pieces<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.369> place<00:00:26.400> it's

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
much getting the pieces in place it's

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.359 
much getting the pieces in place it's
it's<00:00:27.390> getting<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> pieces<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> place<00:00:28.439> without

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
it's getting the pieces in place without

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.759 
it's getting the pieces in place without
messing<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> rest<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> puzzle<00:00:30.869> anyhow

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
messing up the rest of the puzzle anyhow

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
messing up the rest of the puzzle anyhow
the<00:00:32.460> way<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> throw<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.270> nothing<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.140> they

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the way I throw it is nothing like they

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.650 
the way I throw it is nothing like they
do<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.579> might<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.450> bit

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
do it and it might be a little bit

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.510 
do it and it might be a little bit
easier<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.739> there<00:00:37.890> I'm

easier for some of you out there I'm
going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> give<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.320> camera<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
going to give you a camera over the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740

side<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> turn<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.640> way

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
side so I'm going to turn it this way

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.370 
side so I'm going to turn it this way
this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.149> how<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.750> top<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.170> turn

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this is how you get it on top you turn

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
this is how you get it on top you turn
the<00:02:07.500> bottom<00:02:07.860> tuck<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> way<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the bottom tuck that out of the way so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.300

going<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.540> leave<00:03:57.720> one<00:03:58.020> go<00:03:58.530> because<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.850> going

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
going to leave one go because it's going

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.310 
going to leave one go because it's going
to<00:04:00.090> be<00:04:00.180> like<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.360> key<00:04:01.220> for<00:04:02.220> when<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:03.180> our

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
to be like a key for when we do our

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.810 
to be like a key for when we do our
bottoms<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:05.160> you're<00:04:05.310> going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.490> need<00:04:05.670> an

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
bottoms so you're going to need an

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.700 
bottoms so you're going to need an
outlet<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.990> them<00:04:07.170> all<00:04:07.290> now<00:04:07.500> you're

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
outlet so if you do them all now you're

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.990 
outlet so if you do them all now you're
going<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.890> end<00:04:08.010> up<00:04:08.070> messing<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.610> up<00:04:08.760> because

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
going to end up messing one up because

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.670 
going to end up messing one up because
we<00:04:09.150> need<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.480> outlet<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.960> work<00:04:10.170> with<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.530> get

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
we need that outlet to work with to get

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.290 
we need that outlet to work with to get
the<00:04:10.800> Middle's<00:04:11.070> on<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.280> bottom<00:04:11.580> later<00:04:11.820> but<00:04:12.120> so

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
the Middle's on the bottom later but so

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.240 
the Middle's on the bottom later but so
right<00:04:12.630> now<00:04:12.660> we'll<00:04:13.020> just<00:04:13.050> get<00:04:13.350> three<00:04:13.620> as<00:04:13.770> you

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
right now we'll just get three as you

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.150 
right now we'll just get three as you
notice<00:04:14.580> white<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.000> orange<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.720> already<00:04:15.960> done

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
notice white and orange is already done

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.789 
notice white and orange is already done
so<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.190> look<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.520> another<00:04:17.640> one<00:04:17.910> white<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.510> blue

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
so I look for another one white and blue

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.080 
so I look for another one white and blue
so<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:20.010> turn<00:04:20.250> over<00:04:20.280> till<00:04:20.700> I<00:04:20.760> get<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.000> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
so I just turn over till I get to the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.460 
so I just turn over till I get to the
blue<00:04:21.270> side<00:04:21.510> see<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.910> turn<00:04:23.910> it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
blue side see that turn it

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.430 
blue side see that turn it
notice<00:04:25.740> how<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.920> fits<00:04:26.160> right<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:27.080> okay<00:04:28.080> see

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
notice how it fits right in okay see

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.170 
notice how it fits right in okay see
that<00:04:29.360> now<00:04:30.360> if<00:04:30.920> this<00:04:31.920> white<00:04:32.430> was<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.850> bottom

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
that now if this white was on the bottom

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.170 
that now if this white was on the bottom
and<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:34.140> blue<00:04:34.320> was<00:04:34.500> here<00:04:34.880> instead<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:36.030> turning

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
and the blue was here instead of turning

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.580 
and the blue was here instead of turning
it<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.450> putting<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.290> would<00:04:37.500> be

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
it and putting it in it would be

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.800 
it and putting it in it would be
backwards<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.820> move<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.150> out<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.420> way<00:04:39.600> and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
backwards you move it out of the way and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.710 
backwards you move it out of the way and
then<00:04:40.140> flip<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> cube<00:04:40.800> twice<00:04:41.580> see<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.510> flip

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
then flip the cube twice see that flip

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240 
then flip the cube twice see that flip
the<00:04:42.840> face<00:04:43.050> twice<00:04:43.230> now<00:04:43.620> it'll<00:04:43.770> go<00:04:43.920> back<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
the face twice now it'll go back the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.650 
the face twice now it'll go back the
other<00:04:44.280> way<00:04:44.460> right<00:04:44.910> now<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.240> backwards

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
other way right now it's backwards

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.630 
other way right now it's backwards
because<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:46.020> right<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.320> other<00:04:46.440> way

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
because it was right the other way

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.710 
because it was right the other way
anyhow<00:04:48.920> got<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.040> blue<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.370> top<00:04:50.400> okay<00:04:51.180> our<00:04:51.660> next

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
anyhow got the blue on top okay our next

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.480 
anyhow got the blue on top okay our next
white<00:04:52.170> piece<00:04:52.410> will<00:04:52.590> be<00:04:52.710> here<00:04:52.980> we<00:04:53.070> go<00:04:53.160> green<00:04:53.460> and

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
white piece will be here we go green and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.080 
white piece will be here we go green and
white<00:04:54.560> which<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:56.090> on<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:57.450> side<00:04:57.900> right<00:04:58.320> here

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
white which is on this side right here

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.320 
white which is on this side right here
now<00:05:00.090> look<00:05:00.390> white<00:05:01.110> is<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:02.280> one<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.120> face

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
now look white is the one on the face

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.930 
now look white is the one on the face
here<00:05:03.660> where<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.560> want<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.770> put<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.070> see<00:05:05.730> that

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
here where you want to put it see that

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.940 
here where you want to put it see that
Sears<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.900> white<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.260> top<00:05:07.380> white<00:05:07.770> and

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
Sears the white on the top white and

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.800 
Sears the white on the top white and
green<00:05:08.100> goes<00:05:08.520> here<00:05:08.790> so<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.210> want<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.630> white

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
green goes here so you want the white

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.610 
green goes here so you want the white
out<00:05:10.380> on<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:11.550> side<00:05:11.760> of<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:11.970> cube<00:05:12.150> now<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.470> way

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
out on this side of the cube now the way

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.340 
out on this side of the cube now the way
you<00:05:13.680> do<00:05:13.920> that<00:05:14.130> now<00:05:15.030> watch<00:05:15.240> this<00:05:15.420> if<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.140> went

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
you do that now watch this if I went

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.500 
you do that now watch this if I went
this<00:05:16.530> way<00:05:16.740> with<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.130> center<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.730> then<00:05:18.270> came

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
this way with the center and then came

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.370 
this way with the center and then came
down<00:05:18.690> look<00:05:19.230> backwards<00:05:20.190> see<00:05:20.700> that<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:22.169> you<00:05:22.260> got

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
down look backwards see that so you got

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.710 
down look backwards see that so you got
to<00:05:22.470> pay<00:05:22.590> attention<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.390> what<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:24.540> want

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
to do is move it back and flip instead

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.260 
to do is move it back and flip instead
of<00:05:28.830> flipping<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.250> cube<00:05:29.460> this<00:05:29.580> way<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:30.000> flip<00:05:30.210> it

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
of flipping the cube this way to flip it

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.409 
of flipping the cube this way to flip it
that<00:05:30.480> way<00:05:30.600> now<00:05:31.380> move<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.850> I'll<00:05:33.030> go<00:05:33.270> in

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
that way now move to and I'll go in

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.170 
that way now move to and I'll go in
space<00:05:33.660> see<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.110> very<00:05:34.560> very<00:05:34.830> easy<00:05:35.280> there<00:05:36.030> we

space see that very very easy there we

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.950 
space see that very very easy there we
go<00:05:36.440> top<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.710> cube<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.100> done<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:39.630> got<00:05:39.810> the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
go top of the cube is done you got the

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.290 
go top of the cube is done you got the
one<00:05:40.380> left<00:05:40.650> out<00:05:40.860> for<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.220> key<00:05:41.460> we're<00:05:42.090> going<00:05:42.240> to

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
one left out for the key we're going to

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.409 
one left out for the key we're going to
be<00:05:42.390> using<00:05:42.419> that<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:44.060> manipulate<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.150> bottom

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
be using that to manipulate the bottom

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.080 
be using that to manipulate the bottom
okay<00:05:46.460> top<00:05:47.460> Thawne<00:05:48.000> part<00:05:48.660> 1<00:05:49.370> over<00:05:50.370> i'll<00:05:50.910> get

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
okay top Thawne part 1 over i'll get

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.930
