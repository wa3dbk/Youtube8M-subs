 the votes of pse will not be very good you

 they all voted yes and they in this 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.640
 instance represent 28% of the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.640
 votes 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
 many people 93% 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.230
 do not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.330
 and today everything as built-in extremes 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.550
 nacho del rosario to the people who are 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.430
 following that your fans are friends of 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.310
 secondary friends friends and family and 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.700
 family is there if there is so much with the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.700
 family 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.230
 be here and good that it happened to another 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.000
 stage of this program gave them nerves 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.050
 to parents that to see if the money 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.720
 it happens to me and we're very good we had that 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.720
 like this anxiety but not very good 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.660
 happy but very confident also in the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.280
 total of the practical very much is forced 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.280
 and trusting him 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.660
 the songwriter month I liked what you did 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.480
 but I liked it much more about those of the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.950
 little doors he made with me in that future 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.620
 because I think that is something that is 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.630
 original and that distinguishes you so I do not 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:22.549
 I congratulate you on the visit but let's go 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:22.549
 with the 16- hour singer - songwriter 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.120
 opinionel actions I in fact when 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.139
 start this sing with the teles 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.430
 we cross our fingers 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.120
 before it started that you sing 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.259
 song and I think we should bet a 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.759
 little more than when they appear 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.050
 singer-songwriters let us sing their 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.930
 songs is not that they do not leave them or that 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.810
 they do songs that I do not but I want 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.879
 say and I bet on that because today too 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.469
 quite fixed in the tuning by the 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.529
 monitoring not in the most comfortable for you 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.870
 but it was out of tune 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:03.620
 many times the notes 14 40 set out 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.620
 then 440 universal 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:14.039
 440 and it seems to me that he has also put 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.259
 who are artists, so I voted for you too 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.060
 blue and components plays the guitar and 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.909
 sing very well and you have a height of 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.289
 voice that I like clear I like the 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.870
 falsetto when you used it on the doors 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.759
 we also bet on that now guys from 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.009
 Miranda is not too risky to sing a 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.009
 own theme well first 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.310
 and he valued that they do especially 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.190
 interpretation that he did that was very 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.880
 free and I saw him playing with the song 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.010
 let's say shortened to meet a 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.510
 invitation but I saw him have fun and 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.750
 the same thing he did with his own song 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.000
 he did it with this song that was playing and 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.680
 I enjoyed it a lot in one I did not hear you from 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.400
 verbose listen to you relaxed relaxed 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.260
 very loose an open professional 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.260
 agreement in this case we congratulate you
