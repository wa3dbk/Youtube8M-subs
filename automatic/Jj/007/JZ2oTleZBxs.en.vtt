00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
and this is the P part which is very

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.300 
and this is the P part which is very
energy-efficient<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.770> this<00:00:28.950> really

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
energy-efficient in this really

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.800 
energy-efficient in this really
extraordinary<00:00:29.610> car<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.360> want<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.600> thank

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the carp here and we saw this car just

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
the carp here and we saw this car just
by<00:00:39.420> total<00:00:39.720> coincidence<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.560> fell<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.890> love

by total coincidence and I fell in love

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
by total coincidence and I fell in love
with<00:00:41.220> it<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.880> it's<00:00:42.060> not<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:42.780> car<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
with it because it's not like a car you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560 
with it because it's not like a car you
can<00:00:43.470> drive<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.310> a<00:00:44.399> freeway<00:00:44.790> yourself<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.420> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
can drive on a freeway yourself but in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
can drive on a freeway yourself but in
the<00:00:45.690> neighborhood<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> very

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the neighborhood it's very good and very

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
the neighborhood it's very good and very
energy<00:00:48.120> efficient<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> fits<00:00:49.470> for<00:00:49.800> people

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
energy efficient and it fits for people

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
energy efficient and it fits for people
Indian<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.730> could<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.739> easily<00:00:52.739> fit<00:00:52.950> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Indian as you could see I easily fit in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160 
Indian as you could see I easily fit in
there<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.430> effect<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> tried<00:00:54.300> people

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
there some effect they have tried people

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.620 
there some effect they have tried people
that<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.530> 6<00:00:55.829> feet<00:00:56.010> 8<00:00:56.250> tall<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:56.880> fit<00:00:57.390> also

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
that are 6 feet 8 tall and fit also

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.080 
that are 6 feet 8 tall and fit also
easily<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.380> there<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.040> but<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.760> bottom<00:00:59.910> line

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
easily in there so but the bottom line

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060 
easily in there so but the bottom line
is<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> direction<00:01:01.200> that<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.860> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is this is the direction that we have to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.430 
is this is the direction that we have to
go<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.430> order<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> not<00:01:03.450> only<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.960> energy

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
go in order to not only be energy

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.139 
go in order to not only be energy
efficient<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.190> since<00:01:05.550> we<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.910> an

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
efficient but also since we have an

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.240 
efficient but also since we have an
economic<00:01:06.720> crisis<00:01:07.289> people<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.740> less<00:01:07.920> money

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
economic crisis people have less money

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.999 
economic crisis people have less money
that<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:09.360> makes<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:09.960> less<00:01:10.020> expensive

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
that really makes it much less expensive

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.399 
that really makes it much less expensive
to<00:01:11.039> own<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.550> car<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.330> car<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.229> take

neighborhood electric vehicle category

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
neighborhood electric vehicle category
is<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.939> very<00:01:36.180> new<00:01:36.659> category<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.680> of

be able to be recyclable the interesting

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.520 
be able to be recyclable the interesting
thing<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.669> runs<00:02:17.790> off<00:02:18.060> an<00:02:18.239> iPod<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.380> if
