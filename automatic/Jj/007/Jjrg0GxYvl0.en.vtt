you need to store vertically like
cooking<00:01:20.100> sheets<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.760> trays<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.810> even<00:01:22.050> in<00:01:22.140> an

cooking sheets or trays or even in an
office<00:01:22.590> environment<00:01:22.710> maybe<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.820> have

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
office environment maybe you have

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
office environment maybe you have
envelopes<00:01:24.660> that<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> separate<00:01:26.100> out

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
envelopes that you want to separate out

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.960 
envelopes that you want to separate out
so<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.480> are<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> great<00:01:28.140> solution<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.860 

next<00:01:31.660> we<00:01:31.840> have<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.800> magnetic<00:01:33.610> knife<00:01:34.300> holder

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
next we have the magnetic knife holder

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.500 
next we have the magnetic knife holder
now<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:35.710> says<00:01:35.980> knife<00:01:36.340> holder<00:01:36.850> but<00:01:37.240> you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
now it says knife holder but you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.180 
now it says knife holder but you
actually<00:01:38.080> can<00:01:38.380> use<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.010> lot<00:01:39.160> of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
actually can use this in a lot of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.040 
actually can use this in a lot of
different<00:01:39.520> places<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.450> mount<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:40.930> the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
different places so you mount it on the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.530 
different places so you mount it on the
wall<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.680> then<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.370> can<00:01:42.820> use<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
wall and then you can use it in the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.840 
wall and then you can use it in the
workbench<00:01:43.990> area<00:01:44.290> in<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.740> garage<00:01:44.980> or<00:01:45.520> tools

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
workbench area in the garage or tools

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.500 
workbench area in the garage or tools
you<00:01:46.450> can<00:01:46.600> also<00:01:46.750> use<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.290> craft<00:01:47.590> room<00:01:47.830> for

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
you can also use it in a craft room for

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.660 
you can also use it in a craft room for
craft<00:01:49.510> supplies<00:01:49.900> metal<00:01:50.740> cutting<00:01:51.220> tools<00:01:51.520> and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
scissors and things like that but it's a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.760 
scissors and things like that but it's a
very<00:01:54.760> utilitarian<00:01:55.180> thing<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.260> just<00:01:56.470> put<00:01:56.680> it

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
very utilitarian thing you just put it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.290
