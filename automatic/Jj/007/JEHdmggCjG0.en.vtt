00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.929
 loud and welcome to one 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.820
 new video has just been the ios 7 beta 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.369
 3 released by apple for everyone 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.990
 Developer among you and have it now 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.570
 already installed here and I want 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.070
 now just a few short ones 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.840
 but show fine innovations 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.910
 I noticed that up here now 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.380
 the status bar a little bit down 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 this has been offset a bit 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.940
 got thicker or bigger 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.430
 now also on the homescreen 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.640
 little notice so easy a 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.289
 he is a bit more legible and he is 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.489
 another innovation in the status at 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.559
 this is also the route here 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.629
 is displayed when you play music 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.910
 the previous version was so here 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.520
 here the fast access for the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.859
 Music had it here you can do that 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.980
 Continue to turn the song on and on 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.870
 ceiling hung the picture but the eu has 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.120
 so you had to always on the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.390
 go homescreen and look aha us 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.550
 now have 21 clock 38 yes that is 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.570
 now also added that 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.550
 I have always missed so much 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 that was a bit awkward yes 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.000
 otherwise I noticed that each 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.409
 menu of the music also a bit 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.259
 it has been changed that now more 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.939
 so not integrated into the lockscreen 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.799
 more so simply put over it 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.840
 been improved a bit 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.700
 even if he now has his music app 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.909
 it all goes a bit 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.460
 to come out not as I say yes 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.490
 otherwise there was always something about it 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.920
 or one over laid anyway 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.710
 has also been changed a bit 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.100
 otherwise I have to say that in the control 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.259
 center yes the clock was changed 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.780
 because the background is so dark now 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.390
 control center otherwise I have to say 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.430
 that the writing is something like that to me too 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.890
 noticed here is in the lockscreen the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:01.070
 writing is a bit round bit 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.570
 Even if you are here now 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.909
 so goes through the homescreen that is one 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.939
 little little bit changed 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.170
 from the font he just one 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.950
 another font prove one 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.980
 improved font and folders 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.040
 are here now 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.830
 more bluish transparent as before 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.810
 Also if you download an app 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.110
 I 'll just go to the app store 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 on 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.180
 yes you may also be sitting here now 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.590
 already if you have an updated or a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.890
 download new app here is the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.940
 animation added so you see how 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.410
 such a continuous watch as much as 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.489
 far the download is complete 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.620
 is also very cool 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.060
 Do you always know exactly how far that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.049
 download threw that are now mine 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.840
 Renewals that I noticed now 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.180
 are also read that siri one 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.170
 is to sound a bit more natural 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.390
 but now really 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.859
 noticed if I continue like that 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.090
 should also be I will also times 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:06.180
 write something else on the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.739

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 I have in German and there is now 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.290
 Unmark 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.260
 so now has been changed here too 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.660
 that you should just paint here 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.450
 a little change but good I use 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.799
