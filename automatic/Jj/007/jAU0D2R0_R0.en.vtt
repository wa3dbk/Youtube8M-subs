00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello people my name is martin in the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.640
 Today's www.news is about the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.589
 constant fear of paying more 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.719
 dismissal and the rise of stefanie 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.950
 Devil and no fear there is none 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.950
 money in the bank spoiler 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 at the moment there are big uncertainties 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 at the wwe worker because nobody knows that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 right as it is with the pay now 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.039
 not only does the wwe moment go on 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.050
 but makes financial savings 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 also because of the conversion to paper 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 Nobody knows the www network like that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.399
 just how much the superstars are left 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.380
 sometimes get paid extra 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.670
 no one really express themselves 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.739
 but in the coming weeks will be 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 the whole change because the superstars 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.270
 are still out of wrestlemania 30 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 additional payments to whom 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.070
 getting car sales and that's too 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.890
 for the first time since this conversion 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.809
 that the super-stars know how 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 a lot of money now from the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.190
 gets different pay per views 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.230
 of course , rossi mania 30 is the biggest 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.449
 paper jews bad scale 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.670
 Nevertheless, the superstars are already counting 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.130
 so that's definitely going to be less 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 is going on as the last few years over par 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.450
 And that was one of the reasons 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 why it has gone now because no 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 People just know how much 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.650
 money there is in what then then the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.970
 superstars satisfied or not quite so 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 are satisfied and what that for 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 we will then have an impact 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.060
 I'll see you in the next few weeks 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.799
 reports get many of you have 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.689
 certainly seen the last issue 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.180
 and of course the farewell of 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.490
 because that was the last issue 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.530
 her last match is more or less her 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.710
 yes has a small dispute 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 with sammy mad men and is there too 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.210
 the old music of ennio came out 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 Extremely many people celebrated that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.500
 and that was also wiki's own idea 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 of course he still has extremely good pops 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.310
 pulled and how it looks at the moment 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.509
 A comeback is almost complete 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.640
 locked out 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 Everyone knows it for a couple of years 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 segments could happen that time though 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 on the whole, develop with it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.060
 completed and now wants to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.560
 own projects 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.929
 then there was a layoff again and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 though this time josh mathews 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.050
 I do not believe it either 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.940
 win the last dismissal now 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.620
 I think there will still be 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.690
 what followed and josh matthews was 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.290
 actually relatively active before the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.209
 cameras 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.730
 we actually have kickoff at all 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.530
 panels for the preview is always 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.440
 seen and he was just around 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.720
 the wwe network extremely active and all the more 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.239
 It was also surprising that we 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.690
 now quit them also replaced 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.970
 will likely ri jang him although 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.130
 but also has a high view 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.360
 always a bit negative 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.610
 there is, for example, a story 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.230
 in the chapel age you too 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.299
 said she did not backstage 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.799
 always walking around barefoot and that 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.959
 whole was also at the last main 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.209
 event issue of rome in wales with 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.730
 picked up a number too small to wave 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.190
 fence post sent in this direction 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660
 but if only in the young sure 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.970
 a little bit , I think 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.790
 she will probably always be now 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.310
 again the post by josh mathews with 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.459
 take over and then stop with the kickoff 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.900
 I sit panel personal likes place 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.940
 but still sad that you look 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.239
 now from the longtime employee 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.940
 separated josh mathews stefanie maeck 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.980
 was more or less promoted 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.040
 because she has been in the last shows yes 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.350
 always as one of the owners of the wwe 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.950
 announced and now they should 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.349
 soon to be the complete owner of wwe 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.880
 the whole thing should be announced for 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.859
 Of course they prestige a lot more 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.620
 get out and also your character a lot 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.720
 more power to speak is also the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.510
 a sign that I'm in the match and almost 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.489
 completely out of the shows and takes out 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.069
 so self- defined the part of the wwe 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.870
 leadership stops in front of the wwe cameras 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.829
 take over 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.090
 then there was a funny story 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.639
 everywhere in bonn 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.819
 because this was also known 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:00.730
 terminated and also in his contract 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.230
 these 90 days no presence clausen 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.169
 that means that she is with no other 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.930
 promotion after your termination within 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.020
 of 90 days may not occur 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.360
 and thought well 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.430
 just let's go'll go to the ring of 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.440
 honor pay per view and say that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.000
 organizer simply times so that with 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.040
 the wwe everything is clear and that 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.370
 yours can occur and when demand 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.440
 from ring of honor to the wwe is it? 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.970
 He has the same 90 days as everyone else 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.740
 others too and of course that too 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.330
 a bad contract if that was 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.620
 whole same with a lie begins 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.670
 Nevertheless , during the last interview 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.130
 have been backstage and also with 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.870
 Many people are very well informed 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.850
 there are also many old wwe 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.380
 superstars at ring of honor anyway 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.890
 in my opinion a funny one 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.560
 history 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.790
 and it's almost 10 cara like so 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.130
 rather symbolically do not believe that 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.710
 is so good at the new promotion 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.050
 but for all fans we already know 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.930
 that evan bourne will soon join the ring of 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.910
 honor will be so before you do that 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.000
 Video away I will always be from now on 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.980
 at the end of the and car team of the week 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.610
 So show it to everyone 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.840
 still on 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.790
 and then I hope that you have the video 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.320
 if it gives it all 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.300
 but just a thumbs up 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.160
 you can over here my channel yet 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.200
