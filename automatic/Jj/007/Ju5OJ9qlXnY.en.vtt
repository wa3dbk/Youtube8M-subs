guys in position to be successful the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
guys in position to be successful the
one<00:00:56.879> thing<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:57.840> always<00:00:58.140> know

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
one thing I think people always know

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.080 
one thing I think people always know
about<00:00:58.590> Jason<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> he<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.670> somebody<00:01:00.000> had

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
about Jason is he was somebody had

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.479 
about Jason is he was somebody had
always<00:01:00.210> worked<00:01:00.449> hard<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.160> that's<00:01:02.160> something

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
always worked hard and that's something

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.750 
always worked hard and that's something
I<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.910> translate<00:01:03.359> into<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.960> coaching

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
I think will translate into the coaching

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.190 
I think will translate into the coaching
does<00:01:05.760> he<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> learning<00:01:06.330> curve<00:01:06.510> yes<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.170> i

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
does he have a learning curve yes but i

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.500 
does he have a learning curve yes but i
think<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.920> Jason<00:01:08.430> he<00:01:08.970> doesn't<00:01:09.270> take

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
think if you know Jason he doesn't take

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.880 
think if you know Jason he doesn't take
something<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.200> said<00:01:10.409> want<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.740> good

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
something and just said want to be good

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
something and just said want to be good
at<00:01:11.040> he<00:01:11.159> wants<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.490> great<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.090> Billy<00:01:12.330> says

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
at he wants to be great like Billy says

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.899

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
but when I played the game I felt like I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.560 
but when I played the game I felt like I
was<00:01:17.790> extension<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> coach<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:20.540> now<00:01:21.540> i

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
was extension of the coach and now i

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.499
