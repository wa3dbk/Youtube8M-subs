 maybe men convinced and i also want 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.430
 show you my training they think 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.969
 will be similar because basically we 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.820
 we will sew dms 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:49.350
 that in general, nothing much 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 different from each other and shemku 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 little house now I will show you everything in more detail 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:06.380
 and so in this file I have 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 the picture itself is scanned 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:18.960
 set option die menschen this 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.720
 Christmas toys I have long wanted 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.060
 start embroidering already said even in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 some videos about my plans 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.880
 but still no thanks for that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.960
 joint projects like you can not do yourself 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.890
 something to force 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.890
 and finally set up embroidery 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.439
 something not planned to sew me 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.119
 I will be happy to embroider I will 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.119
 completely all 6 houses is unique 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.850
 we will just begin our meaning 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.040
 joint project table 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 we want not just to embroider these houses yes 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.430
 but also 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.430
 give these houses to each other 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.140
 that is, I will embroider for lole she 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.590
 will embroider for me and then we are with her 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.880
 let's exchange the promise of embroidered glasses and already 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.760
 ready toys in a dream dedicated 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.330
 thought and decided to embroider only one 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.490
 the house is the same to us not me why she 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.470
 because I plan later 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.390
 embroider all the houses and so I donâ€™t 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.700
 sews twice the same house 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.660
 case become if you are looking for another cape not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.300
 agreed on one must and came to 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.690
 the conclusion that we will embroider this one 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.690
 the house is this house 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.070
 last sixth 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.010
 and schemes for this idea 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.420
 shooting itself is quite a big way but 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 so how are the big icons here 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:20.849
 wrong and did not think that they can for a long time and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.590
 hard here it is this shemk and here i am 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.300
 For comparison, I'll show you already prepared 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.870
 outline 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:33.739
 marked up did markup 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:39.480
 just follow the contour, see the drawing and 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:44.519
 congar much less embroider miss not 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.580
 will be on 18 counterter equally so they 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.170
 we succeeded 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:55.170
 yes this way I will embroider 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.989
 hoops on the round well maybe take 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.940
 a little more 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.400
 because these are so very small 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.400
 I thought that they probably will take more 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.880
 Further strings at home with I bought by 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:20.120
 the key 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:23.540
 I translated demedzha in dms and I bought already 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.130
 but most of all I will 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.750
 gradually buy as the thread 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.370
 after all, expensive pleasure 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.610
 we are now they cost 33 rubles shook 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.200
 so I already bought twenty 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:41.440
 then there will still be a little 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.440
 Less than half buy this 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.500
 pleasure strings at home and writing 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.830
 days tender black threads of something 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.570
 there was no store 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.830
 are over and when they will not yet know 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:01.160
 but is it that the model is replaced such strings 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.450
 and since I don't like rewinding at home and 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.050
 sleep bobbins me and maggie embroider mini on 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.860
 commemoration 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.620
 she's a bone I like to embroider 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.720
 on the bone next to so i have 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.790
 different from if for example being 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.919
 I will be this collection is not so let 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.400
 some lady with me they will 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:25.790
 be different right away 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 by way of storage I bought two 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:34.450
 Packing bobbins while under this 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.450
 the quantity will then still be purchased and 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.840
 all my preparation I will take a bit later 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.980
 embroidery will wear all the threads on 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.560
 reels 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.860
 here and then somehow their file or 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:56.160
 somewhere I will organize everything together 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.910

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.720
