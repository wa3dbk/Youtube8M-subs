00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
are you you suppose I don't much come on

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
are you you suppose I don't much come on
no<00:02:04.350> matter<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:05.909> my<00:02:06.090> idea

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.099 

all<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.670> was<00:02:32.209> designed<00:02:32.629> to<00:02:32.780> collect

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
all of it was designed to collect

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.300 
all of it was designed to collect
starlight<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.010> then<00:02:34.640> I'm<00:02:35.390> not<00:02:35.659> sure<00:02:36.129> split<00:02:37.129> it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
starlight and then I'm not sure split it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.690 
starlight and then I'm not sure split it
somehow<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:38.930> my<00:02:39.409> idea<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.859> replace<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.579> of

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
somehow it was my idea to replace one of

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.460 
somehow it was my idea to replace one of
the<00:02:40.790> key<00:02:41.000> elements<00:02:41.239> with<00:02:41.689> our<00:02:41.870> focusing

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
the key elements with our focusing

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.080 
the key elements with our focusing
crystal<00:02:42.939> months<00:02:43.939> of<00:02:44.090> enchantments<00:02:44.840> winning

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
crystal months of enchantments winning

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.300 
crystal months of enchantments winning
it<00:02:47.170> let's<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.469> hope<00:02:48.650> they<00:02:48.799> got<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.069> right

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it let's just hope they got it right

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.550 
it let's just hope they got it right
this<00:02:49.519> time

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
this time

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.640 
this time
here<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:52.840> magnificent<00:02:53.840> isn't<00:02:54.079> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
here it is magnificent isn't it

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
took an incredible amount of work to get

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:57.879 
took an incredible amount of work to get
it<00:02:57.290> running<00:02:57.590> again

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
it running again

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:06.449 
it running again
I<00:03:03.970> am<00:03:04.970> hoping<00:03:05.269> it'll<00:03:05.450> all<00:03:05.629> be<00:03:05.780> worth<00:03:05.810> it

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
I am hoping it'll all be worth it

I am hoping it'll all be worth it
place<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.639> crystal<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.299> central

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
place the crystal in the central

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.750 
place the crystal in the central
apparatus<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:09.919> can<00:03:10.069> start<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.519> process

apparatus and we can start the process
for<00:03:11.030> focusing

what's this these results they're not at
all<00:05:05.520> what<00:05:05.580> they<00:05:05.909> should<00:05:06.210> be<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:07.740> projection

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
all what they should be this projection

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.420 
all what they should be this projection
should<00:05:08.669> be<00:05:08.789> lit<00:05:08.999> up<00:05:09.029> like<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.479> night<00:05:09.629> sky
