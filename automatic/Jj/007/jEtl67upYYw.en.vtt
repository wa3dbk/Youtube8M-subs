00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:10.030
 good afternoon as we can see then 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.110
 we removed the stock due to the problem of 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.890
 a spill of piston oil 3 where 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:24.890
 where we make sure 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.890
 on the blog beach 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.930
 Seneca that I am a star had 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.070
 changed but how can you 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.020
 look after 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.020
 of it is low 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.840
 there you can have 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.790
 you can see then that the shirt works 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.790
 and the oil spill 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.310
 at 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.200
 pistons 3 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.270
 this means that 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.290
 how likely has the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.410
 ring of 20 and worked perfect condition 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 and we see that it goes for the road because they are 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.100
 I arrived 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.360
 it's so normal it 's the same as this one is not 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.680
 solid 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 the 4 nothing 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.440
 just the number 3 shirt where we can 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 see here 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.049
 the tier 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.049
 in the shirt 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.040
 this can mean the spill of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.240
 oil 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.690
 of shirt number 3 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.810
 then heard that we have see 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.159
 in packaging 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.159
 all full of oils 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.340
 that was the cause of the smoke he made 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 when he was armed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 to notify then that the shirts 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.170
 multiply if we can lower the engine or 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.170
 do not 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.860
 let's wait leave the answer of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 rectify 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 Amen 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.090
 and from download it 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.090
 the engine or it can be fed 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.040
 well I share with you later and 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.040
 I hope that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.430
 that we keep sharing 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.540
 good luck can follow 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.490
 and a pleasure to share it in the army 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.870
 we will share step by step as well 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.400
 how's it going 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.400
 the engine already armed 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.750
 and how can they in time despite 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.920
 this engine can be very difficult because 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.220
 maintains 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.130
 how to say does not have pointers anything 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.990
 the deadlock 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.810
 he does not have any fight but that 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.920
 let's do let's see what happened 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.330
 step to be happy and evenings 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.330
 the broad lion roberto 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.190
 I feel proud of my work
