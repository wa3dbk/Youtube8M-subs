00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.130
 and today I would like to do with you 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.970
 impossible cube asher that is illusion 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.429
 third part 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.730
 and letâ€™s get started with you 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:24.359
 make for like this square 14 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:28.080
 by 14 14 by 14 and this will be our first 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.510
 layer first stage of the second stage us 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.649
 enjoy three columns by 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:44.059
 on 9 we are doing such two for two 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:50.719
 enemy from three four five six seven 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:54.289
 eight and nine here we already have 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:00.449
 preparation do such 3 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:06.000
 put here right here right here and here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.700
 here the next step will be like 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.860
 do the same thing below 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 above that is here so here you put 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.350
 how are we going to look 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 scream whether to go to just I don't know 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.380
 which is not easy for me to do it for 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:31.380
 skate and put here it will be 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 stand that is firmly and securely not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.900
 fear yes so i'm a little dumb 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 the other should be excuse me this here 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.909
 and for this column is also being filled 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.570
 99 by 2 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.380
 height only with such an unusual 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.369
 cut here in this cut insert here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.790
 such a thing here is 322 that is six 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:08.509
 close down 6 and up 6 like this 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:12.810
 here we insert here 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.180
 so quiet carefully so here it will be 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.909
 look then I'll tell you what's funny 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:27.480
 and paste in here and here almost 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:32.220
 our cube is missing only one 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.329
 Linna's garbage we need 10 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.290
 onion plate is like this 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:45.989
 100 8 yes here it's so necessary 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.810
 here so put here put well 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.569
 short like this sludge 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:57.480
 so not the other way around 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:03:02.549
 so all lie down all right so well 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.419
 here we put the six like this 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:14.579
 six here four well shorter 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:21.209
 Four, and here we fix the three axis 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:24.120
 will give our tactics such and almost ours 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:30.180
 cube and ball ready to put here a 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.629
 by the way yes put on 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 8 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.859
 blocks 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:38.400
 that is, see how it looks like 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:43.819
 one on the sixth blocks we leave this 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:50.190
 here and dvoechku and here four on one 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:54.269
 fix here 2 so here and set 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.579
 here and here is our cube and Escher is ready 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.489
 and what's his joke and what is this 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.209
 the illusion is like that, but how it is now 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.709
 nearly 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.389
 from again from the right angle 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:10.590
 sit down like this he like this illusion 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.290
 transformed here need more 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.130
