00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.360
 we are the trio broz a string trio 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.430
 in fact we dream of violin viola e 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.449
 cello or two violins e 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.820
 cello 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.280
 I'm a barbarian, the violinist then there is 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.280
 my sister jade and my brother klaus 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.580
 we are in fact three brothers and true that there 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.560
 we have known for a lifetime but it is also already 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.060
 so long we play together indeed 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.550
 last year we celebrated the 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.070
 our twentieth anniversary twenty years 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.350
 which started by studying logically 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.630
 but we have had the honor of just 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.070
 work with great musicians 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.770
 at major academies and how 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.290
 the academy of santa cecilia in rome 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.610
 the mozarteum university of salzburg the la 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.400
 chigiana of siena 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.440
 the European academy of the quartet and then 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.680
 we started doing concerts e 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.170
 we did various tours around the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.399
 world from the united states to china from 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 South Africa carrying England with us 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.210
 also of the compositions we have 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.680
 really very much at heart that there are 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.110
 In fact, they have been entered by important 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.060
 composers like luis bacalov or azio 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.009
 corghi and that we also had the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 ability to affect for important 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.070
 record companies like the universal la 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.070
 his classic 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.180
 Hi everyone 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.830
 the audio fia I am paolo hello I am 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.340
 as you will have understood from the first part of the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.540
 video 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 we want to present ours today 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.950
 the most ambitious project is the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.300
 sampling of a string trio are 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.890
 among exceptional musicians we have 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.320
 recorded a unique context like that 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.450
 of the theater of the voices of Treviso that 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.550
 combines the unique features of a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.150
 recording room to those of a hall 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.150
 from concert 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.390
 but the reason we are here today is 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.280
 to present you some aspects 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.680
 innovations introduced at the time of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.170
 scripting we have developed software 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.840
 external analyzing and volumes of all 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.150
 sample el imports in a format 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.240
 compatible with contact this technique 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.740
 called dynamic control engine ci 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.360
 allows us to make sure that 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.870
 transitions between the samples are the most 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.580
 natural as possible because the software 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.290
 reshapes the volumes of the incoming samples 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.320
 based on sample volumes 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.120
 previous this also allows us to 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.820
 avoid normalizing compress 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.260
 always keeping unchanged the 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.410
 musical qualities of the material 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.410
 registered 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.060
 as you heard from this brief 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.680
 example elm was using pc uil 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.040
 to meet is quite little used in the 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.740
 crossbars libraries internet box only go 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
 the ing u piece allows to obtain 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.060
 an incisive attack 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.390
 or an expressive crescendo 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.390
 at the beginning of the phase 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.090
 it also allows you to perform a glide 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.090
 instead of the traditional legato 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.270
 also at the end of the sentence is 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.220
 can get a decrescendo al 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.220
 place of the traditional relay sample 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.009
 how did you hear the dynamic control 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.479
 engine allows us to connect all of them 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.960
 these techniques absolutely 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.580
 uniform to create fragile realistic 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.550
 there are three micro fa nations present 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.310
 different joints as strong 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.889
 detached and pinched and all the parameters 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.159
 Engine interiors are configurable a 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.159
 will 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.110
 no 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.710
 only various trio broz will be issued to 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.210
 May later we will be 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.530
 viola and cello 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.570
 having said that we thank you have 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.570
 goodbye hello from fa florio hello
