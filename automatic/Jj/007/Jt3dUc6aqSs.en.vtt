00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
a particularly fast computer and this is

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.180 
a particularly fast computer and this is
something<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.170> not<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.470> lot<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.710> people<00:01:20.920> be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
interesting here and already I'm

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.289 
interesting here and already I'm
clicking<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.470> button<00:01:26.710> 24<00:01:27.340> done<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.820> it's

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
clicking the button 24 done and it's

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.690 
clicking the button 24 done and it's
taking<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.780> little<00:01:28.900> bit<00:01:29.050> so<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.310> load<00:01:30.550> up

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
taking a little bit so this this load up

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.889 
taking a little bit so this this load up
is<00:01:30.759> going<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.970> take<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.450> little<00:01:31.479> bit

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
is going to take just a little bit

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.389 
is going to take just a little bit
longer<00:01:32.530> than<00:01:32.830> expected<00:01:32.860> here<00:01:35.100> already<00:01:36.100> there

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
longer than expected here already there

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.830 
longer than expected here already there
you<00:01:36.460> can<00:01:36.610> see<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.090> background<00:01:37.300> as<00:01:37.630> its

you can see in the background as its

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.210 
you can see in the background as its
building<00:01:38.170> terrain<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.920> dirt

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
building terrain that that dirt

building terrain that that dirt
background<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:39.940> already<00:01:40.119> see<00:01:40.360> it's

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
background you can already see it's

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.380

again looks just a little bit weird but

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.259 
again looks just a little bit weird but
it<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.200> don't<00:02:59.859> really<00:03:00.010> think<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.850> as<00:03:00.910> kind

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269

let me just fly over here and show you
guys<00:03:27.880> an<00:03:28.210> example<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> looks<00:03:29.740> like<00:03:29.920> in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
guys an example of what it looks like in

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.870 
guys an example of what it looks like in
regular<00:03:30.610> gameplay<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:32.490> this<00:03:33.490> is<00:03:33.670> funny

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
regular gameplay now this is funny

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.520 
regular gameplay now this is funny
because<00:03:34.090> we've<00:03:34.360> got<00:03:34.540> we've<00:03:35.050> got<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.260> chickens

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
because we've got we've got the chickens

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.380 
because we've got we've got the chickens
that<00:03:35.740> just<00:03:35.980> look<00:03:36.130> slightly<00:03:36.550> more<00:03:36.880> realistic

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
that just look slightly more realistic

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.630 
that just look slightly more realistic
here<00:03:37.630> if<00:03:38.230> you're<00:03:38.800> gonna<00:03:38.920> look<00:03:39.160> over<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:39.550> at

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
here if you're gonna look over here at

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.430 
here if you're gonna look over here at
the<00:03:39.730> chickens<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.180> they<00:03:40.300> ever<00:03:40.420> stop<00:03:40.900> moving

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
the chickens if they ever stop moving

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.050 
the chickens if they ever stop moving
they<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.190> look<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.430> little<00:03:42.610> bit<00:03:42.760> more<00:03:42.880> like

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
they just look a little bit more like

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.230 
they just look a little bit more like
chickens<00:03:43.420> our<00:03:44.350> sheep<00:03:45.130> here<00:03:45.430> again<00:03:45.820> just<00:03:46.060> look

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
chickens our sheep here again just look

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.430 
chickens our sheep here again just look
a<00:03:46.420> little<00:03:46.930> bit<00:03:47.170> different<00:03:48.210> but<00:03:49.210> overall<00:03:49.570> it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
a little bit different but overall it

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.740 
a little bit different but overall it
looks<00:03:50.980> really<00:03:51.520> nice<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.360> only<00:03:52.510> thing<00:03:52.660> I

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
looks really nice the only thing I

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.270 
looks really nice the only thing I
noticed<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.260> you'll<00:03:53.440> notice<00:03:53.710> that<00:03:53.890> when<00:03:54.010> as<00:03:54.130> i

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
noticed is you'll notice that when as i

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.070 
noticed is you'll notice that when as i
move<00:03:54.490> it<00:03:54.640> looks<00:03:54.790> really<00:03:55.090> really<00:03:55.390> grainy<00:03:55.720> so

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
move it looks really really grainy so

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.199 
move it looks really really grainy so
maybe<00:03:56.320> if<00:03:56.470> they<00:03:56.590> fix<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.130> then<00:03:57.820> they'll<00:03:58.030> be

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
maybe if they fix that then they'll be

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.670 
maybe if they fix that then they'll be
able<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.450> change<00:03:58.630> but<00:03:58.840> even<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.110> wild<00:03:59.440> grass

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
able to change but even the wild grass

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.090 
able to change but even the wild grass
looks<00:04:00.040> fantastic<00:04:01.080> it's<00:04:02.080> definitely<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.680> great

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
looks fantastic it's definitely a great

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.780 
looks fantastic it's definitely a great
display<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.520> what<00:04:04.180> minecraft<00:04:04.900> can<00:04:05.110> really<00:04:05.530> do

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
display of what minecraft can really do

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.640 
display of what minecraft can really do
and<00:04:06.790> perhaps<00:04:07.060> look<00:04:07.780> into<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.200> future<00:04:08.500> of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and perhaps look into the future of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.390 
and perhaps look into the future of
maybe<00:04:09.340> more<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.700> an<00:04:09.850> HD<00:04:10.300> minecraft<00:04:11.400> experience

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
maybe more of an HD minecraft experience

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.340 
maybe more of an HD minecraft experience
and<00:04:12.700> maybe<00:04:12.910> if<00:04:13.180> people<00:04:13.510> really<00:04:13.690> fine-tune

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
and maybe if people really fine-tune

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.789 
and maybe if people really fine-tune
this<00:04:14.560> kind<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.870> texture<00:04:16.870> pack<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:17.290> large

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
this kind of a texture pack this large

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.229 
this kind of a texture pack this large
or<00:04:18.010> texture<00:04:18.310> pack<00:04:18.459> then<00:04:18.700> we<00:04:18.790> could<00:04:18.910> be<00:04:19.060> seeing

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
or texture pack then we could be seeing

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.180 
or texture pack then we could be seeing
some<00:04:19.480> really<00:04:19.810> awesome<00:04:20.109> stuff<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.830> future
