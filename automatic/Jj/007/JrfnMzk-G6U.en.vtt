00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
wrapped up in the fact that they can

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
wrapped up in the fact that they can
shut<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.619> opponents<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> combat

the floor we got to do all those
physical<00:01:02.670> things<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.270> hard<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.840> on

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

the<00:01:04.140> offensive<00:01:04.619> end<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.430> they<00:01:05.760> make<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the offensive end because they make you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
work on the offensive end as did Chicago

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
work on the offensive end as did Chicago
so<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.990> thought<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.320> did<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.500> good<00:01:10.650> job

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so and I thought we did a good job

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
so and I thought we did a good job
except<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.240> eight<00:01:12.450> minute<00:01:12.780> period

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
except for you know eight minute period

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
except for you know eight minute period
in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.680> chicago<00:01:14.310> game<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
in the chicago game and that was the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
in the chicago game and that was the
difference<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.869> game<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.220> mark<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
difference in the game so the mark of a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.100 
difference in the game so the mark of a
winning<00:01:17.880> team<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.450> able<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> execute

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
winning team is to be able to execute

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.899 
winning team is to be able to execute
and<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.560> those<00:01:19.740> things<00:01:20.100> under<00:01:20.430> pressure<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and do those things under pressure on

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.929 
and do those things under pressure on
the<00:01:21.030> physicality<00:01:22.220> grabbing<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.369> holding<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the physicality grabbing and holding and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
the physicality grabbing and holding and
still<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.540> job<00:01:24.869> offensively<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.950> kind
