00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.119
 hi welcome back a contribution that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.990
 dates back to the Aztec times 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.090
 the integration of two systems 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.520
 food production well tested in 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
 a relationship of natural symbiosis a 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.869
 this tonic water the system that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.640
 that is, it combines culture together 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.009
 the breeding of aquatic species el 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.020
 hydroponic or vegetable culture 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.399
 without using the land 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.410
 we visited the first plant 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.640
 made in Italy in an environment 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 closed within a field nor a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.170
 industrial that of palombara ni si 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.670
 found in brands 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.649
 an example that we hope can be 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.519
 widespread throughout the national territory 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.969
 which shows how it is possible 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.789
 recover industrial sheds also 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.050
 abandoned making them of us again 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.239
 manufacturing 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.280
 using this system I am in 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.879
 italy and innovative as a large part 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.810
 in Europe 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.170
 although it is now at present 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:12.799
 consolidated both as production and as 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.450
 income in most nations I quote 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.020
 united states australia canada mexico e 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.020
 away talking 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.679
 a natural irrigation system 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.659
 so that despite the ancient origins 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.049
 turns out to be absolutely avant-garde 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.220
 both technological and environmental built 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.289
 in full compliance with the dynamics 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.200
 sustainable and with significant advantages 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.789
 in terms of water savings, re cycle 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.770
 continuous water used for 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.990
 at least six months no fertilizers 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.020
 chemicals and fertilizers a model ad 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.069
 practically no environmental impact 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.479
 based on the exclusive use of 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.850
 biological material that is revealed 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.299
 interesting also from the point of view 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.469
 we feel economic because the advantages are 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.049
 can be summarized first in the 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:03.109
 possibility of creating new jobs 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.630
 effective new professional figures e 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:09.229
 who runs a tonal qua plant 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 he is not a simple peasant but he is a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.780
 expert in both aquatic animal biology 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.640
 both of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.470
 both with agronomic skills but not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.150
 necessarily must be a graduate 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 our effort is to make 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.680
 simple a matter that apparently 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.390
 up to be the results of 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.860
 complicated and tonic water is configured 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.480
 therefore as a possible answer 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.209
 to the current economic system crisis 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.020
 as well as an undisputed system of 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.020
 natural production 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.730
 collect information on the systems on 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.900
 costs and best practices used 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.760
 in Italian municipalities for management 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.769
 of separate waste collection 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.599
 by packaging this is the purpose 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.340
 of the survey methods and equipment 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.319
 costs of separate waste collection in 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.480
 italy led by the work group 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.239
 separate waste collection guidelines for 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.290
 the coordination committee anci conai 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.200
 the study he took as a sample 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.939
 representative of 68 municipalities of the peninsula 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.709
 identifies useful indications for 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.989
 promote the forms of standardization 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.819
 organizational models of the collection 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.769
 and the equipment and the suitable one 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.389
 signage and provides an estimate of 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.030
 costs related to individual fractions 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.400
 collected as well as the identification of 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.889
 determining factors in the same costs 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.549
 of the collection thanks for following us 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.549
 we will be back with the next edition 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.549
 see you later
