mean I guess nortron wooden plate last
turn<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.390> he<00:00:19.109> feels<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.439> he<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:19.680> needs

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
turn but he feels like he really needs

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.370 
turn but he feels like he really needs

mean<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:23.510> no<00:00:24.510> matter<00:00:24.660> how<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.960> kind<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
mean it's no matter how you kind of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.660 
mean it's no matter how you kind of
think<00:00:25.859> about<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.869> it<00:00:27.869> feels<00:00:28.140> bad<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
think about it it feels bad to do it the

think about it it feels bad to do it the
noid<00:00:29.910> Ron's<00:00:30.210> pretty<00:00:30.539> much<00:00:30.689> guaranteed<00:00:31.460> it's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
noid Ron's pretty much guaranteed it's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
noid Ron's pretty much guaranteed it's
not<00:00:32.640> guaranteed<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.870> boat

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
not guaranteed because it could get boat

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.540 
not guaranteed because it could get boat
off<00:00:34.880> but<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.809> pretty<00:00:36.960> likely<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.040> proc<00:00:38.280> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
off but it's pretty likely to proc this

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
if not a very burdened relatively easily

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
if not a very burdened relatively easily
well<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.560> could<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> seen<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.119> kill

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
well we could have seen the the kill

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
well we could have seen the the kill
command<00:01:21.479> come<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:23.070> he<00:01:23.250> wouldn't<00:01:23.460> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
command come out but he wouldn't really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
command come out but he wouldn't really
get<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> develop<00:01:24.330> anything<00:01:24.540> great<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.259> but

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
get to develop anything great then but

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.100 
get to develop anything great then but
he<00:01:26.070> would<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.430> 31<00:01:27.030> ones<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> board<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
he would have 31 ones on the board and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.859 
he would have 31 ones on the board and
he'd<00:01:28.680> keep<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.250> Scott<00:01:29.490> goes<00:01:29.670> board<00:01:29.909> clear<00:01:30.210> but

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
he'd keep off Scott goes board clear but

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.359 
he'd keep off Scott goes board clear but
I<00:01:30.900> guess<00:01:31.110> pushing<00:01:31.560> damage<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.100> really

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I guess pushing damage is really

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.740 
I guess pushing damage is really
effective<00:01:32.759> against<00:01:32.939> max<00:01:33.180> shaman<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
effective against max shaman this is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.060 
effective against max shaman this is
something<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in here but it doesn't really make too

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
in here but it doesn't really make too
much<00:01:58.229> sense<00:01:58.290> he<00:01:59.009> might<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> chance<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
much sense he might have a chance to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.480 
much sense he might have a chance to
kill<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.479> fire<00:02:00.689> guard<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.320> further<00:02:02.040> protect

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
his freezing trap but it's not that big

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.560 
his freezing trap but it's not that big
of<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.250> chance<00:02:05.490> he<00:02:05.700> could<00:02:05.880> play<00:02:06.030> around<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
of a chance he could play around or a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.900 
of a chance he could play around or a
shock<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.229> I'm<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.890> sure<00:02:07.920> how<00:02:08.280> even<00:02:08.610> upset

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
shock but I'm not sure how even upset

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.059 
shock but I'm not sure how even upset
you<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.509> he<00:02:10.110> uses<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> earth<00:02:10.709> shock<00:02:10.920> while

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you are if he uses the earth shock while

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.340 
you are if he uses the earth shock while
he<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.340> does<00:02:11.970> decided<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> trade<00:02:12.660> in

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
he actually does decided to trade in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.180 
he actually does decided to trade in
if<00:02:13.740> he<00:02:13.860> picks<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.280> off<00:02:14.520> holy<00:02:15.420> moly<00:02:16.020> Wow<00:02:16.650> Andy

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
if he picks this off holy moly Wow Andy

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
if he picks this off holy moly Wow Andy
gets<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.550> save<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.030> bow<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> that's<00:02:21.000> even

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
gets to save the bow and so that's even

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.250 
gets to save the bow and so that's even
better<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.620> mean<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.630> don't<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.230> much

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
better I mean I I don't like it as much

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.230 
better I mean I I don't like it as much
because<00:02:25.770> seventy-five<00:02:26.610> percent<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.060> time

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
because seventy-five percent of the time

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.830 
because seventy-five percent of the time
you<00:02:27.390> had<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> use<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.960> bow<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.540> way<00:02:30.690> it

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you had to use the bow but the way it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.260 
you had to use the bow but the way it
worked<00:02:31.050> out<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.640> insanely<00:02:32.640> good<00:02:32.940> frame<00:02:33.150> you

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
worked out is insanely good frame you

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.910 
worked out is insanely good frame you
actually<00:02:33.570> develop<00:02:33.870> even<00:02:33.960> more<00:02:34.110> power<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
actually develop even more power on the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.420 
actually develop even more power on the
board<00:02:35.210> yeah<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.200> mean<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:38.040> start

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
pushing you can just hit face you can

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.880 
pushing you can just hit face you can
kill<00:02:40.920> command<00:02:41.130> face<00:02:41.720> yeah<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:45.770> don't<00:02:46.770> really
