today<00:00:05.460> on<00:00:05.580> future<00:00:05.879> tech<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.299> talking<00:00:06.629> about

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
today on future tech we're talking about

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
mind control which as it turns out

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.910 
mind control which as it turns out
sometimes<00:00:09.420> means<00:00:09.690> getting<00:00:10.019> control<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.590> your

sometimes means getting control of your

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.400 
sometimes means getting control of your

a type of headsets that actually reads
your<00:00:26.099> brainwaves<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:26.849> EEG<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.840> fine

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
your brainwaves or EEG that's fine

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.849 
your brainwaves or EEG that's fine
that's<00:00:28.500> fine

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that's fine

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.279 
that's fine
this<00:00:29.070> appears<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> be<00:00:29.519> my<00:00:29.730> brain<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.929> your

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this appears to be my brain this is your

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.220 
this appears to be my brain this is your
brain<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:31.980> digitized<00:00:32.579> okay<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.110> first

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
brain when digitized okay so the first

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.299 
brain when digitized okay so the first
thing<00:00:34.410> you're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
thing you're going to know this is that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.209 
thing you're going to know this is that
white<00:00:35.520> line<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.300> called<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> raw<00:00:36.750> EEG

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
white line which is called the raw EEG

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
white line which is called the raw EEG
signal<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> completely

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
signal and that's just a completely

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.310 
signal and that's just a completely
unfiltered<00:00:41.210> reaction<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.870> electrical

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
unfiltered reaction of the electrical

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.420 
unfiltered reaction of the electrical
energy<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.829> coming<00:00:43.950> off<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.309> your

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
energy that's coming off of your

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.520 
energy that's coming off of your
forehead<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:45.660> using<00:00:46.170> sophisticated

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
forehead then using sophisticated

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
forehead then using sophisticated
algorithms<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> software<00:00:48.180> takes<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> data

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
algorithms the software takes the data

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
algorithms the software takes the data
from<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.320> brain<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> shows<00:00:50.610> my<00:00:50.910> mental<00:00:51.300> state

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
from my brain and shows my mental state

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
from my brain and shows my mental state
are<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:53.070> attentive<00:00:53.460> individual<00:00:55.070> from<00:00:56.070> there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
are very attentive individual from there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.950 
are very attentive individual from there
I<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:57.149> start<00:00:57.420> training<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.320> mind<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.840> can<00:01:00.840> see

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I can start training my mind I can see

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
I can start training my mind I can see
my<00:01:01.109> brain<00:01:01.320> doing<00:01:02.070> things<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> where<00:01:03.210> yoga

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
my brain doing things this is where yoga

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.670 
my brain doing things this is where yoga
practitioners<00:01:04.049> could<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.530> good

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
practitioners could be really good

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
practitioners could be really good
because<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.369> turn<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
because they can just turn it on and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
because they can just turn it on and
just<00:01:07.200> lower<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> heart<00:01:07.830> rate<00:01:07.890> lower<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just lower the heart rate lower the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.149 
just lower the heart rate lower the
metabolism<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.960> relaxed<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.950> all

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
metabolism and be relaxed and it's all

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
metabolism and be relaxed and it's all
done<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.420> headset<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> clip

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
done with this little headset and clip

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.980 
done with this little headset and clip
on<00:01:13.500> earpiece<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.610> logistically<00:01:15.360> like

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
on earpiece so just logistically like

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
on earpiece so just logistically like
how<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.640> talking<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
how is this talking to this is it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
how is this talking to this is it
bluetooth<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.890> way<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.280> works<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
bluetooth the way that it works is that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
bluetooth the way that it works is that
your<00:01:21.570> body<00:01:21.960> gives<00:01:22.290> off<00:01:22.500> electrical<00:01:23.040> signals

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
your body gives off electrical signals

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
your body gives off electrical signals
and<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:24.990> make<00:01:25.200> instruments<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.799> measure

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and we make instruments that measure

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
and we make instruments that measure
that<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:26.880> via<00:01:27.060> bluetooth<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that and then via bluetooth that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390 
that and then via bluetooth that
communicates<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.829> device<00:01:29.070> should<00:01:29.280> we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
communicates with the device should we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
communicates with the device should we
like<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.420> baby<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.900> arrived<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.590> this

who's that guy paradoxically I seem to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.420 
who's that guy paradoxically I seem to
relax<00:01:53.280> more<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.670> talk<00:01:55.070> one<00:01:56.070> star<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.649> then

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
relax more when I talk one star and then

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.300 
relax more when I talk one star and then
I<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.390> exploding<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.289> of<00:02:01.439> redbull

there's<00:02:05.310> our<00:02:05.429> rope<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:06.600> tried<00:02:06.990> tug<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> war

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789
