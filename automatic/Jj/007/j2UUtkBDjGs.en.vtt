hello<00:00:00.480> and<00:00:00.719> welcome<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.230> our<00:00:01.319> origami

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
hello and welcome to our origami

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.700 
hello and welcome to our origami
circular<00:00:02.310> glider<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:03.020> so<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.200> circular

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
circular glider video so this circular

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.349 
circular glider video so this circular
structure<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.339> actually<00:00:05.520> your<00:00:05.970> pretty<00:00:06.180> good

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
structure is actually your pretty good

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.290 
structure is actually your pretty good
glider<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.839> easy<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.319> make<00:00:07.730> you<00:00:08.730> start<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.269> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
glider is easy to make you start with a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.930 
glider is easy to make you start with a
square<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.840> origami<00:00:09.960> paper<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:11.429> closed<00:00:11.700> side

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
square of origami paper the closed side

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.810 
square of origami paper the closed side
down<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.660> then<00:00:13.500> make<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> valley<00:00:14.190> fold<00:00:14.309> as

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
down and then make a valley fold as

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.800 
down and then make a valley fold as
we're<00:00:14.969> showing<00:00:15.179> here<00:00:15.540> along<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.170> diagonal

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.560 

make<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> nice<00:00:25.400> clean<00:00:26.400> crease<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> paper

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
make a nice clean crease of the paper

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.889 
make a nice clean crease of the paper
here<00:00:32.030> next<00:00:33.030> we're<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> fold<00:00:33.690> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
here next we're going to fold this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.790 
here next we're going to fold this
bottom<00:00:34.110> edge<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> triangle<00:00:35.059> upwards

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
bottom edge of the triangle upwards

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.000 
bottom edge of the triangle upwards
about<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.040> centimeter<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:42.800> just<00:00:43.800> like

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
about one centimeter or so just like

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:55.730 
about one centimeter or so just like
this

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.510 

all<00:00:56.340> right<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:56.760> each<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> end<00:00:58.200> pieces<00:00:59.190> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
all right now each of the end pieces of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
all right now each of the end pieces of
the<00:00:59.610> flap<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.180> followed<00:01:00.450> up<00:01:01.460> actually

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the flap we just followed up actually

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.730 
the flap we just followed up actually
has<00:01:02.580> a<00:01:02.610> little<00:01:02.880> pocket<00:01:03.410> what<00:01:04.410> we're<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
has a little pocket what we're going to

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.120 
has a little pocket what we're going to
do<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.720> insert<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.260> end<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:08.370> pocket<00:01:09.890> into<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
do is insert one end one pocket into the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.190 
do is insert one end one pocket into the
other<00:01:11.250> pocket<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
other pocket just like this so one of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.690 
other pocket just like this so one of
the<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.800> pieces<00:01:14.160> will<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.340> slightly

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the one of the pieces will be slightly

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
the one of the pieces will be slightly
smaller<00:01:15.090> than<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.010> take

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
smaller than the other and you just take

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.510 
smaller than the other and you just take
that<00:01:17.430> piece<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:20.180> nice<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> tight<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
that piece in nice and tight like that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.040 
that piece in nice and tight like that
and<00:01:23.520> once<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.690> you<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
and once you have that what you want to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.950 
and once you have that what you want to
do<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.410> go<00:01:25.860> around<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.340> piece<00:01:26.840> with<00:01:27.840> your

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
do is go around the piece with your

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.700 
do is go around the piece with your
fingers<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.900> shape<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.500> nice

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
fingers and shape it so that it's nice

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.630 
fingers and shape it so that it's nice
and<00:01:32.010> circular<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.800> more<00:01:34.800> circular<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.460> make

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and circular and more circular you make

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.070 
and circular and more circular you make
this<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> better<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.010> airplane<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.550> fly<00:01:42.080> so

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
this the better the airplane will fly so

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.070 
this the better the airplane will fly so
take<00:01:43.260> your<00:01:43.410> time<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.040> around<00:01:44.130> shape<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.580 

just<00:01:49.080> like<00:01:49.260> that<00:01:53.900> that's<00:01:54.900> all<00:01:55.080> there<00:01:55.260> is<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
just like that that's all there is to it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.190 
just like that that's all there is to it
now<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.650> want<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> take<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> circular<00:01:59.670> glider

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
now you want to take the circular glider

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.419 
now you want to take the circular glider
hold<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.470> you're<00:02:01.619> showing<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.280> your

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
hold it as you're showing here with your

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.830 
hold it as you're showing here with your
forefinger<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.090> top<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.509> thumb<00:02:03.660> below

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
forefinger on top of your thumb below

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
forefinger on top of your thumb below
hold<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.289> above<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.679> head<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:06.270> let<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
hold it above your head and just let it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.130 
hold it above your head and just let it
fall<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> floor<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.509> fall<00:02:09.750> almost

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
fall to the floor it will fall almost

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
fall to the floor it will fall almost
straight<00:02:10.410> down<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:11.310> level<00:02:11.700> off<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.150> nice

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
