alright<00:00:01.860> guys<00:00:01.979> I<00:00:02.129> want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.310> show<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:03.259> USB

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
alright guys I want to show you a USB

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.970 
alright guys I want to show you a USB
thumb<00:00:04.589> drive<00:00:04.859> hack<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> just<00:00:05.850> completed

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
thumb drive hack that I just completed

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.700 
thumb drive hack that I just completed
where<00:00:07.980> I've<00:00:08.250> basically<00:00:08.700> created<00:00:09.269> a

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
where I've basically created a

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.830 
where I've basically created a
self-destructing<00:00:10.710> USB<00:00:11.550> thumb<00:00:11.730> drive<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
self-destructing USB thumb drive and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.379 
self-destructing USB thumb drive and
this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:13.679> data<00:00:13.830> security<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:15.240> prevent

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
this is for data security to prevent

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.730 
this is for data security to prevent
your<00:00:15.690> data<00:00:15.870> from<00:00:16.109> falling<00:00:16.410> into<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.650> wrong

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
your data from falling into the wrong

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.450 
your data from falling into the wrong
hands

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
hands

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.650 
hands
so<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.090> there<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
so you can see there here this is a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.779 
so you can see there here this is a
normal<00:00:19.020> USB<00:00:19.410> thumb<00:00:19.890> drive<00:00:20.160> nothing<00:00:20.550> special

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
normal USB thumb drive nothing special

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.359 
normal USB thumb drive nothing special
about<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:22.020> one's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.350> 256<00:00:23.160> megabytes

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
about it this one's a 256 megabytes

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.509 
about it this one's a 256 megabytes
model<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.720> pretty<00:00:24.960> old<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
model so it's pretty old you know you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.609 
model so it's pretty old you know you
can<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.760> many<00:00:27.300> many<00:00:27.510> gigabytes<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.439> one

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
can get many many gigabytes now on one

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
can get many many gigabytes now on one
of<00:00:28.680> these<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.420> see<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
of these things but you can see this

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
of these things but you can see this
ones<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.990> he<00:00:31.170> has<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> plastic<00:00:31.859> case<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.430> what

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
ones that he has a plastic case and what

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.260 
ones that he has a plastic case and what
I<00:00:33.059> did<00:00:33.329> basically<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.969> cracked<00:00:35.969> open<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
I did basically is I cracked open the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
I did basically is I cracked open the
case<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.290> able<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.280> circuit

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
case and I was able to get this circuit

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.229 
case and I was able to get this circuit
board<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.340> basically<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> did<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
board here and basically what I did is I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
board here and basically what I did is I
took<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.780> circuit<00:00:43.649> board<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.160> installed

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
took this circuit board and I installed

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
took this circuit board and I installed
it<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.940> new<00:00:45.149> plastic<00:00:45.450> case<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.530> gonna

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it in a new plastic case so I'm gonna

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.290 
it in a new plastic case so I'm gonna
show<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.070> looks<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.820> here

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
show you what that looks like right here

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770 
show you what that looks like right here
so<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.910> self-destructing<00:00:50.910> USB

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so this is the self-destructing USB

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.299 
so this is the self-destructing USB
thumbdrive

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
thumbdrive

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
thumbdrive
so<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> has<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> USB<00:00:54.239> plug<00:00:54.750> sticking<00:00:55.680> out

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so it has got the USB plug sticking out

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
so it has got the USB plug sticking out
here<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.820> plug<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.180> into<00:00:57.239> your

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
here you can plug that into your

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.220 
here you can plug that into your
computer<00:00:57.960> access<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.890> files<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.730> normal

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
computer access your files like normal

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.420 
computer access your files like normal
did<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> differences<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
did one of the differences is that I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
did one of the differences is that I
have<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> striking<00:01:03.359> pad<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
have a striking pad on the back here and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.080 
have a striking pad on the back here and
I'll<00:01:04.890> show<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.369> exactly<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.850> used

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
I'll show you what exactly that's used

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'll show you what exactly that's used
for<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.960> go<00:01:07.080> ahead<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.409> twist<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> cap

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
for you go ahead and twist off the cap

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
for you go ahead and twist off the cap
in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> back<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.810> actually<00:01:10.320> find<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
in the back here you actually find that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
in the back here you actually find that
the<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.659> case<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.439> filled<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.479> matches<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the the case is filled with matches and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.260 
the the case is filled with matches and
so<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.650> four<00:01:16.920> matches<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.119> can

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
so there are four matches here and I can

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.850 
so there are four matches here and I can
take<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> striking<00:01:19.110> pad<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> strike

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
take this in the striking pad and strike

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.880 
take this in the striking pad and strike
this<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.060> ignite<00:01:21.540> these<00:01:22.439> matches

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
this and it will ignite these matches

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.440 
this and it will ignite these matches
the<00:01:23.280> rest<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> filled<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.210> match

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the rest of this is filled with match

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
the rest of this is filled with match
heads<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.770> happen<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
heads so what will happen is is when I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
heads so what will happen is is when I
ignite<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.420> gonna<00:01:27.600> burn<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
ignite this it's gonna burn down like a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.010 
ignite this it's gonna burn down like a
John<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> giant<00:01:29.460> match<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.930> gonna

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
John it's just a giant match it's gonna

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
John it's just a giant match it's gonna
burn<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.710> gonna<00:01:31.829> completely<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
burn down it's gonna completely and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.170 
burn down it's gonna completely and
totally<00:01:32.729> cook<00:01:33.329> those<00:01:33.570> electronics<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.460> make

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
totally cook those electronics and make

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.640 
totally cook those electronics and make
them<00:01:36.390> make<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> data<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.439> them

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
them make the data that's on them

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.450 
them make the data that's on them
completely<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> totally<00:01:38.780> 100%

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
completely and totally 100%

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.940 
completely and totally 100%
unrecoverable<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> basic<00:01:43.619> gist

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
unrecoverable so that's the basic gist

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.730 
unrecoverable so that's the basic gist
of<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.670> simple<00:01:45.060> took<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.540> maybe

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
of it it's very simple took me maybe

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.960 
of it it's very simple took me maybe
it's<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.950> took<00:01:47.070> me<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.399> an<00:01:47.640> hour<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's what we took me about an hour to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
it's what we took me about an hour to
build<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.140> too<00:01:49.259> bad<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> use

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
build it's not too bad and you can use

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.499 
build it's not too bad and you can use
any<00:01:50.520> USB<00:01:50.939> data<00:01:51.780> dated<00:01:52.740> thumb<00:01:52.920> drive<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.549> has

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
any USB data dated thumb drive that has

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
any USB data dated thumb drive that has
a<00:01:54.540> plastic<00:01:54.990> case<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> case<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
a plastic case or a case that you can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.219 
a plastic case or a case that you can
remove<00:01:56.549> easily<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> electronics

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
remove easily and get to the electronics

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.550 
remove easily and get to the electronics
inside<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.520> one<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> reasons<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.229> used

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
inside so one of the reasons that I used

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
inside so one of the reasons that I used
striking<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.399> didn't<00:02:02.700> use<00:02:02.790> strike-anywhere

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
striking I didn't use strike-anywhere

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
striking I didn't use strike-anywhere
matches<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.689> used<00:02:03.960> strike<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.649> box<00:02:04.890> matches<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
matches I used strike on box matches and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
matches I used strike on box matches and
the<00:02:05.969> reason<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.840> they're<00:02:07.680> more

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the reason for that is that they're more

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.620 
the reason for that is that they're more
safer<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.660> wouldn't<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.440> you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
safer so you wouldn't you know you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.820 
safer so you wouldn't you know you
could<00:02:10.750> set<00:02:10.930> off<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.290> strike<00:02:11.470> anywhere<00:02:11.770> matches

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
could set off a strike anywhere matches

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.160 
could set off a strike anywhere matches
match<00:02:12.310> if<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.880> friction<00:02:13.090> shock<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.020> can

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
match if just for friction shock you can

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.020 
match if just for friction shock you can
actually<00:02:14.680> hit<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> hammer<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.850> they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
actually hit one with a hammer and they

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.560 
actually hit one with a hammer and they
usually<00:02:16.240> just<00:02:16.420> burst<00:02:16.780> into<00:02:16.930> flames<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.570> this

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
usually just burst into flames so this

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.690 
usually just burst into flames so this
is<00:02:19.870> an<00:02:20.020> advantage<00:02:20.320> because<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:21.040> take<00:02:21.250> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
is an advantage because I can take you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.040 
is an advantage because I can take you
can<00:02:21.850> see<00:02:22.030> here<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.540> go<00:02:22.660> ahead<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.870> grab<00:02:23.020> it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
can see here I can go ahead and grab it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.100 
can see here I can go ahead and grab it
match<00:02:23.560> up<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.310> box<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.820> if<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:26.080> some

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
match up the box and if I have some

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.680 
match up the box and if I have some
sandpaper<00:02:26.530> or<00:02:26.920> something<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.700> won't<00:02:27.880> start<00:02:28.510> it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
sandpaper or something it won't start it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.430 
sandpaper or something it won't start it
for<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.020> match<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.720> use<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.170> strike

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
for that match but if I use the strike

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.230 
for that match but if I use the strike
material<00:02:32.890> on<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> box<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.580> has<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> chemicals

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
material on a box that has the chemicals

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.630 
material on a box that has the chemicals
required<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.020> reaction<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.590> occur<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
required for this reaction to occur and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.150 
required for this reaction to occur and
you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.820> see<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.120> ignites<00:02:37.630> very<00:02:37.870> easily<00:02:38.160> so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
you can see it ignites very easily so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.560 
you can see it ignites very easily so
that's<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.640> know<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.850> bit<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> safety<00:02:40.300> you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
that's you know a bit of a safety you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.240 
that's you know a bit of a safety you
can<00:02:40.600> only<00:02:40.840> strike<00:02:41.260> anywhere<00:02:41.560> matches<00:02:41.620> here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
can only strike anywhere matches here

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.290 
can only strike anywhere matches here
and<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.490> can<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.880> use<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> piece<00:02:43.270> of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
and you can just use a piece of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.930 
and you can just use a piece of
sandpaper<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:44.230> I'd<00:02:45.070> recommend<00:02:45.520> using<00:02:45.730> this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
sandpaper but I'd recommend using this

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.280 
sandpaper but I'd recommend using this
strike<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.360> bot<00:02:46.570> box<00:02:46.900> matches<00:02:49.140> give<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
strike on bot box matches give you a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
strike on bot box matches give you a
demonstration<00:02:50.470> shortly<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.590> go<00:02:54.160> ahead<00:02:54.220> and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
demonstration shortly so go ahead and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.770 
demonstration shortly so go ahead and
start<00:02:54.550> building<00:02:54.790> that's<00:02:55.060> what<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.360> need<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.660> do

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
start building that's what I need to do

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.600 
start building that's what I need to do
is<00:02:55.960> I'm<00:02:56.080> using<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.680> little<00:02:56.770> piece<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.070> PVC<00:02:57.190> pipe

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
is I'm using a little piece of PVC pipe

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.780 
is I'm using a little piece of PVC pipe
having<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.330> PPC<00:02:58.720> end<00:02:59.080> cap<00:02:59.350> here<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.550> I'm<00:03:00.640> gonna

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
having a PPC end cap here and I'm gonna

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.840 
having a PPC end cap here and I'm gonna
drill<00:03:01.060> some<00:03:01.240> holes<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:02.040> couple<00:03:03.040> holes<00:03:03.310> so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
drill some holes in it a couple holes so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.800 
drill some holes in it a couple holes so
the<00:03:04.120> USB<00:03:04.960> plug<00:03:05.140> can<00:03:05.500> fit<00:03:05.740> through<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.780> I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
the USB plug can fit through that so I

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.860 
the USB plug can fit through that so I
may<00:03:10.960> use<00:03:11.110> my<00:03:11.290> drill<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.800> do<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.100> right<00:03:12.870> so

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
may use my drill to do that right so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.660 
may use my drill to do that right so
I've<00:03:13.960> gone<00:03:14.140> ahead<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.380> used<00:03:14.980> my<00:03:15.130> drill<00:03:15.400> to

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
I've gone ahead and used my drill to

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.970 
I've gone ahead and used my drill to
drill<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.940> couple<00:03:16.120> holes<00:03:16.300> in<00:03:16.660> line<00:03:16.870> here<00:03:17.290> and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
drill a couple holes in line here and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.460 
drill a couple holes in line here and
now<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.660> USB<00:03:20.250> plug<00:03:21.250> will<00:03:21.610> fit<00:03:21.820> down<00:03:22.000> into<00:03:22.210> that

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
now the USB plug will fit down into that

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
now the USB plug will fit down into that
so<00:03:23.470> I'm<00:03:23.530> gonna<00:03:23.620> take<00:03:23.770> this<00:03:23.890> guy<00:03:24.100> off<00:03:24.780> and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
so I'm gonna take this guy off and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.340 
so I'm gonna take this guy off and
trying<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.410> lose<00:03:26.740> him<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.480> can<00:03:28.630> see<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.140> I

can pop this guy through like that what
I'm<00:03:33.190> gonna<00:03:33.280> do<00:03:33.490> is<00:03:33.610> I'm<00:03:33.700> gonna<00:03:33.820> epoxy<00:03:34.420> that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna epoxy that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.810 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna epoxy that
into<00:03:34.900> place<00:03:35.200> because<00:03:36.040> he<00:03:36.220> creates<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.640> little

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
into place because he creates a little

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.960 
into place because he creates a little
container<00:03:37.210> for<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.020> that<00:03:39.010> chip<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.790> got

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
container for that that chip is I got

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.970 
container for that that chip is I got
this<00:03:40.060> piece<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.540> half-inch<00:03:40.870> PVC<00:03:41.140> pipe<00:03:41.620> and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
this piece of a half-inch PVC pipe and

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.030 
this piece of a half-inch PVC pipe and
I'm<00:03:42.520> going<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.760> cut<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.940> piece<00:03:43.180> off<00:03:43.390> of<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:44.040> to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
I'm going to cut a piece off of that to

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.900 
I'm going to cut a piece off of that to
use<00:03:45.250> as<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:45.700> internal<00:03:46.209> housing<00:03:47.459> for<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.640> USB

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
use as the internal housing for the USB

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.290 
use as the internal housing for the USB
thumb<00:03:49.120> drive<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.540> self-destructs

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.820 

so<00:03:57.300> as<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.660> see<00:03:57.810> what<00:03:58.140> I've<00:03:58.260> done<00:03:58.290> is

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
so as you can see what I've done is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.490 
so as you can see what I've done is
simply<00:03:59.310> fit<00:03:59.580> a<00:04:00.060> half<00:04:00.270> inch<00:04:00.480> PVC<00:04:00.720> pipe<00:04:01.110> inside

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
simply fit a half inch PVC pipe inside

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.760 
simply fit a half inch PVC pipe inside
of<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.790> PVC<00:04:02.790> end<00:04:03.060> cap<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.590> gonna

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
of this PVC end cap and this is gonna

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.100 
of this PVC end cap and this is gonna
form<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.040> enclosure<00:04:05.490> for<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.420> USB<00:04:06.630> Thunderer

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
form the enclosure for the USB Thunderer

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.560 
form the enclosure for the USB Thunderer
and<00:04:07.590> I've<00:04:07.980> actually<00:04:08.130> glued<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:08.580> with<00:04:09.180> a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
and I've actually glued that with a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.750 
and I've actually glued that with a
superglue<00:04:09.990> you<00:04:10.410> could<00:04:10.530> also<00:04:10.650> use<00:04:10.980> epoxy<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.670> do

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
superglue you could also use epoxy to do

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.160 
superglue you could also use epoxy to do
that<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.180> basically<00:04:12.510> just<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:13.020> there

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
that and it's basically just in there

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.930 
that and it's basically just in there
now<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.040> plug<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.220> into<00:04:14.490> use<00:04:14.790> of

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
now and you can plug this into use of

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.090 
now and you can plug this into use of
your<00:04:15.030> board<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.360> works<00:04:15.510> fine<00:04:15.859> taking<00:04:16.859> these

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
your board it works fine taking these

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.949 
your board it works fine taking these
matches<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:17.970> cut<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.269> heads<00:04:18.450> off<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.810> them

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
matches and cut the heads off of them

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.349 
matches and cut the heads off of them
and<00:04:19.079> I'm<00:04:19.950> going<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.280> pack<00:04:20.549> these<00:04:20.820> match<00:04:21.030> heads

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
and I'm going to pack these match heads

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.530 
and I'm going to pack these match heads
into<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.620> cavity<00:04:23.040> around<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:24.240> circuit<00:04:24.540> board

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
into the cavity around the circuit board

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.630 
into the cavity around the circuit board
and<00:04:27.540> then<00:04:28.260> I'm<00:04:28.590> gonna<00:04:28.740> use<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:28.980> couple<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.490> these

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
and then I'm gonna use a couple of these

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.610 
and then I'm gonna use a couple of these
matches<00:04:30.210> or<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.390> cut<00:04:30.570> down<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> little<00:04:30.870> bit<00:04:31.140> and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
matches or to cut down a little bit and

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.580 
matches or to cut down a little bit and
insert<00:04:32.190> those<00:04:32.400> into<00:04:37.700> this<00:04:38.700> guy<00:04:38.880> like<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.590> I'm

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
insert those into this guy like so I'm

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.280 
insert those into this guy like so I'm
gonna<00:04:40.770> make<00:04:40.890> sure<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.040> fits<00:04:42.470> pretty<00:04:43.470> well

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
gonna make sure that fits pretty well

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.680 
gonna make sure that fits pretty well
that's<00:04:46.290> just<00:04:46.530> fine<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.880> these<00:04:48.000> four<00:04:48.330> are<00:04:48.600> gonna

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
that's just fine so these four are gonna

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.610 
that's just fine so these four are gonna
provide<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.650> kind<00:04:50.100> of<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> fuse<00:04:51.320> or<00:04:52.320> I'm

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
provide the kind of the fuse or I'm

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.780 
provide the kind of the fuse or I'm
gonna<00:04:52.770> go<00:04:52.950> ahead<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.220> demonstrate<00:04:53.340> how<00:04:53.730> the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
gonna go ahead and demonstrate how the

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.400 
gonna go ahead and demonstrate how the
thumbdrive<00:04:54.030> still<00:04:54.450> functions<00:04:55.020> even<00:04:55.320> though

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
thumbdrive still functions even though

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.620 
thumbdrive still functions even though
I've<00:04:55.530> hacked<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:57.090> go<00:04:57.180> ahead<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.390> plug<00:04:57.480> it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
I've hacked it and go ahead and plug it

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.130 
I've hacked it and go ahead and plug it
into<00:04:57.750> my<00:04:57.840> laptop<00:04:57.930> here<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:59.100> USB<00:04:59.520> port<00:04:59.790> as<00:05:00.150> you

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
into my laptop here the USB port as you

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.790 
into my laptop here the USB port as you
can<00:05:01.260> see<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.919> pops<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.340> dialog<00:05:02.610> box<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:03.800> we

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
can see that pops up a dialog box and we

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.830 
can see that pops up a dialog box and we
can<00:05:04.919> view<00:05:05.040> all<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.220> files<00:05:05.340> add<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.300> modified

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
can view all the files add and modified

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.860 
can view all the files add and modified
anything<00:05:07.590> we<00:05:07.680> need<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.860> do<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.390> then<00:05:09.390> go<00:05:09.750> ahead

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
anything we need to do and then go ahead

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:40.350 
anything we need to do and then go ahead
and<00:05:09.960> plug<00:05:10.110> it

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:48.499 

all<00:05:40.960> righty<00:05:44.129> all<00:05:45.129> right<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:46.030> went<00:05:46.719> ahead<00:05:46.780> and

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
all righty all right so I went ahead and

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.749 
all righty all right so I went ahead and
tried<00:05:49.509> this<00:05:49.689> thing<00:05:49.930> out

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
tried this thing out

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.080 
tried this thing out
hey<00:05:51.759> 90<00:05:52.240> just<00:05:52.419> fine<00:05:52.659> it<00:05:52.780> burned<00:05:52.990> out<00:05:53.139> all<00:05:53.349> the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
hey 90 just fine it burned out all the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.790 
hey 90 just fine it burned out all the
all<00:05:55.090> of<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.389> match<00:05:55.569> heads<00:05:55.870> inside<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.409> only

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
all of the match heads inside the only

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.459 
all of the match heads inside the only
problem<00:05:57.189> this<00:05:57.389> is<00:05:58.389> that<00:05:58.689> it<00:05:58.870> actually<00:05:58.930> still

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
problem this is that it actually still

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:05.510 
problem this is that it actually still
works<00:06:02.639> I<00:06:03.639> can<00:06:04.120> access<00:06:04.479> all<00:06:04.629> the<00:06:04.659> files<00:06:04.930> still

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
works I can access all the files still

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.219 
works I can access all the files still
so<00:06:06.520> clearly<00:06:06.849> it<00:06:07.000> was<00:06:07.120> not<00:06:07.270> enough<00:06:07.569> to<00:06:07.840> actually

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
so clearly it was not enough to actually

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.059 
so clearly it was not enough to actually
cook<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.740> components<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:11.680> cheating<00:06:12.009> the

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
cook the components the cheating the

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.159 
cook the components the cheating the
match<00:06:12.219> has<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.520> an<00:06:12.639> idea<00:06:12.909> head<00:06:13.210> for<00:06:13.509> this<00:06:13.659> and

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
match has to an idea head for this and

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.050 
match has to an idea head for this and
these<00:06:14.289> USB<00:06:14.680> drives<00:06:15.039> are<00:06:15.250> obviously<00:06:15.819> a<00:06:15.879> lot

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
these USB drives are obviously a lot

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.059 
these USB drives are obviously a lot
more<00:06:16.090> robust<00:06:16.479> than<00:06:16.659> I<00:06:16.719> thought

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
more robust than I thought

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.980 
more robust than I thought
of<00:06:19.000> course<00:06:19.210> I<00:06:19.300> shouldn't<00:06:19.449> be<00:06:19.599> surprised

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
of course I shouldn't be surprised

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.050 
of course I shouldn't be surprised
because<00:06:20.500> when<00:06:20.919> they<00:06:21.039> build<00:06:21.279> these<00:06:21.759> circuit

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
because when they build these circuit

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.909 
because when they build these circuit
boards<00:06:22.330> they<00:06:22.539> use<00:06:22.810> a<00:06:23.550> flux<00:06:24.550> mask<00:06:24.789> and<00:06:25.439> a<00:06:26.439> molten

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
boards they use a flux mask and a molten

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.429 
boards they use a flux mask and a molten
solder<00:06:27.490> bath<00:06:27.879> which<00:06:28.270> is<00:06:28.300> like<00:06:28.569> 500<00:06:29.080> degrees<00:06:29.289> or

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
solder bath which is like 500 degrees or

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.100 
solder bath which is like 500 degrees or
more<00:06:29.909> and<00:06:30.909> all<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.210> components<00:06:31.569> survive<00:06:31.840> that

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
more and all the components survive that

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.939 
more and all the components survive that
so<00:06:32.669> the<00:06:33.669> design<00:06:33.969> does<00:06:34.150> survive<00:06:34.569> some<00:06:35.020> heat<00:06:35.289> but

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
so the design does survive some heat but

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.529 
so the design does survive some heat but
it<00:06:36.039> looks<00:06:36.189> like<00:06:36.279> matches<00:06:36.669> are<00:06:36.789> not<00:06:36.819> sufficient

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
it looks like matches are not sufficient

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.760 
it looks like matches are not sufficient
to<00:06:37.599> generate<00:06:37.750> enough<00:06:38.050> heat<00:06:38.080> to<00:06:38.319> actually<00:06:38.650> cook

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
to generate enough heat to actually cook

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.619 
to generate enough heat to actually cook
the<00:06:38.949> components<00:06:40.169> one<00:06:41.169> thought<00:06:41.349> I<00:06:41.379> had<00:06:41.590> was<00:06:41.770> to

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629 
the components one thought I had was to

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.540 
the components one thought I had was to
to<00:06:43.629> basically<00:06:43.750> fill<00:06:44.589> this<00:06:44.740> up<00:06:44.919> instead<00:06:45.400> of

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
to basically fill this up instead of

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.369 
to basically fill this up instead of
filling<00:06:45.789> up<00:06:45.849> with<00:06:45.969> match<00:06:46.150> heads<00:06:46.449> to<00:06:47.139> scrape

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379 
filling up with match heads to scrape

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:48.839 
filling up with match heads to scrape
the<00:06:47.560> match<00:06:47.740> head<00:06:47.919> material<00:06:48.430> off<00:06:48.580> because

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
the match head material off because

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.240 
the match head material off because
there's<00:06:49.000> actually<00:06:49.060> a<00:06:49.270> fair<00:06:49.509> amount<00:06:49.569> of<00:06:49.719> wood

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
there's actually a fair amount of wood

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.529 
there's actually a fair amount of wood
in<00:06:51.250> each<00:06:51.400> one<00:06:51.580> of<00:06:51.639> those<00:06:51.729> match<00:06:51.909> heads<00:06:52.210> so

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
in each one of those match heads so

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.689 
in each one of those match heads so
that's<00:06:52.839> not<00:06:53.020> you<00:06:53.440> know<00:06:53.529> as<00:06:53.710> flammable<00:06:54.310> as<00:06:54.520> the

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
that's not you know as flammable as the

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.189 
that's not you know as flammable as the
match<00:06:54.849> head<00:06:55.060> material<00:06:55.509> itself<00:06:55.839> that<00:06:56.080> chemical

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
match head material itself that chemical

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.890 
match head material itself that chemical
or<00:06:59.699> and<00:07:00.699> I'm<00:07:00.940> not<00:07:01.089> really<00:07:01.180> sure<00:07:01.449> what<00:07:01.599> else<00:07:01.719> I

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
or and I'm not really sure what else I

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.600 
or and I'm not really sure what else I
can<00:07:02.050> use<00:07:02.289> that<00:07:02.319> will<00:07:02.710> generate<00:07:03.370> sufficient

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
can use that will generate sufficient

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.579 
can use that will generate sufficient
heat<00:07:04.150> I'll<00:07:04.599> have<00:07:04.690> to<00:07:04.779> brainstorm<00:07:04.990> some<00:07:05.349> ideas

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:05.589 
heat I'll have to brainstorm some ideas

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.480 
heat I'll have to brainstorm some ideas
maybe<00:07:06.580> you<00:07:06.759> guys<00:07:06.909> can<00:07:07.589> leave<00:07:08.589> some<00:07:08.889> comments

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
maybe you guys can leave some comments

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.550 
maybe you guys can leave some comments
and<00:07:09.849> come<00:07:10.180> up<00:07:10.270> with<00:07:10.360> some<00:07:10.509> ideas<00:07:10.839> of<00:07:11.110> you<00:07:11.529> know

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
and come up with some ideas of you know

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.999 
and come up with some ideas of you know
what<00:07:11.889> I<00:07:11.919> can<00:07:12.159> use<00:07:12.279> is<00:07:12.460> a<00:07:12.819> hotter<00:07:13.029> material<00:07:14.009> to

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:15.009 
what I can use is a hotter material to

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.319 
what I can use is a hotter material to
cook<00:07:15.279> this<00:07:15.539> let<00:07:16.539> me<00:07:16.599> know<00:07:16.719> you<00:07:16.779> guys<00:07:17.020> think
