00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
and this is a rarely used match my first

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.009 
and this is a rarely used match my first
one<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.949> I've<00:00:55.129> done<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:55.699> Rob<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.750> bet<00:00:56.930> he

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
one that I've done so Rob the bet he

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.320 
one that I've done so Rob the bet he
needs<00:00:57.199> arbok<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.010> he<00:00:58.190> misses<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.640> gunk<00:00:59.000> shot

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
needs arbok and he misses the gunk shot

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.110 
needs arbok and he misses the gunk shot
soul<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:00.350> hit<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.620> blizzard<00:01:01.159> now<00:01:01.640> I<00:01:01.670> think

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
soul and I hit the blizzard now I think

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.680 
soul and I hit the blizzard now I think
dunk<00:01:02.540> shot<00:01:02.839> has<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.140> higher<00:01:03.500> base<00:01:04.040> accuracy<00:01:04.760> so

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
dunk shot has a higher base accuracy so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.200 
dunk shot has a higher base accuracy so
the<00:01:06.140> fact<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.740> he<00:01:06.890> misses<00:01:07.340> his<00:01:07.640> attack<00:01:08.000> when

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
the fact that he misses his attack when

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.480 
the fact that he misses his attack when
i<00:01:08.240> hit<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.540> blizzard<00:01:09.080> which<00:01:09.260> is<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.530> base<00:01:09.860> 70

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
I was not even expecting that to be

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.279 
I was not even expecting that to be
honest<00:01:46.039> because<00:01:46.189> most<00:01:46.520> are<00:01:46.609> defensive<00:01:47.179> but<00:01:48.079> um

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
honest because most are defensive but um

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.999 
honest because most are defensive but um
anyways<00:01:49.280> he<00:01:49.850> switches<00:01:50.149> out<00:01:50.479> because<00:01:50.840> I'm

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
anyways he switches out because I'm

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.889 
anyways he switches out because I'm
pretty<00:01:52.009> much<00:01:52.219> settled<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.640> mean<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:53.090> can<00:01:53.780> pretty

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
pretty much settled I mean I can pretty

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.490 
pretty much settled I mean I can pretty
much<00:01:54.079> set<00:01:54.469> up<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.890> him<00:01:55.130> all<00:01:55.340> day<00:01:55.520> long<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.500> I

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
much set up on him all day long and I

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.560 
much set up on him all day long and I
noticed<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.759> Sharpedo<00:01:59.119> doesn't<00:01:59.479> have

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
noticed that the Sharpedo doesn't have

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.749 
noticed that the Sharpedo doesn't have
speed<00:01:59.899> boost<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.920> or<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.219> didn't<00:02:01.549> kick<00:02:01.729> in

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
speed boost that or it didn't kick in

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.910 
speed boost that or it didn't kick in
right<00:02:01.939> away<00:02:02.240> I'm<00:02:02.600> trying<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.499> remember<00:02:03.710> how

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
right away I'm trying to remember how

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.090 
right away I'm trying to remember how
that<00:02:04.130> works<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.670> think<00:02:05.539> he<00:02:06.439> has<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.710> be<00:02:06.859> on<00:02:07.009> the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
that works I think he has to be on the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.219 
that works I think he has to be on the
field<00:02:07.310> for<00:02:07.460> at<00:02:07.729> least<00:02:07.880> one<00:02:08.270> turn<00:02:08.539> after<00:02:08.780> he<00:02:09.080> was

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
field for at least one turn after he was

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.070 
field for at least one turn after he was
sent<00:02:09.440> out<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.520> I'm<00:02:10.910> gonna<00:02:11.390> assume<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.900> was

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
sent out so I'm gonna assume that was

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.620 
sent out so I'm gonna assume that was
the<00:02:12.230> deal<00:02:12.440> there<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.300> he's<00:02:14.300> gonna<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.569> to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the deal there so he's gonna go to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.360 
the deal there so he's gonna go to

based because a lot of the threat and
hope<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.770> threatening<00:04:04.130> pugs<00:04:04.490> ended<00:04:04.790> our

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
hope the threatening pugs ended our

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.160 
hope the threatening pugs ended our
special<00:04:05.330> attackers<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.880> guess<00:04:08.840> that's

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
special attackers so I guess that's

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.790 
special attackers so I guess that's
something<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.740> need<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.360> like<00:04:11.360> look<00:04:11.870> around<00:04:12.470> and

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
the strategy that I usually like to run

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.150 
the strategy that I usually like to run
with<00:06:16.730> it<00:06:17.000> so<00:06:17.330> I<00:06:17.570> just<00:06:18.080> go<00:06:18.380> for<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:18.680> thing<00:06:18.919> just<00:06:19.100> to

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
with it so I just go for I thing just to

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.570 
with it so I just go for I thing just to
try<00:06:19.460> to<00:06:19.490> take<00:06:19.730> that<00:06:19.760> but<00:06:20.090> nothing<00:06:20.960> like<00:06:21.080> lives

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
try to take that but nothing like lives

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.850 
try to take that but nothing like lives
barely<00:06:22.580> live<00:06:22.790> so<00:06:23.150> my<00:06:23.330> what<00:06:23.750> what<00:06:24.320> is<00:06:24.410> going<00:06:24.590> on

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
barely live so my what what is going on

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.940 
barely live so my what what is going on
here<00:06:25.720> then<00:06:26.720> again<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:26.990> don't<00:06:27.050> have<00:06:27.260> max<00:06:27.500> special

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
here then again I don't have max special

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.310 
here then again I don't have max special
tags<00:06:28.190> so<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:28.580> guess<00:06:28.760> that<00:06:28.970> does<00:06:29.690> explain<00:06:29.990> a

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
tags so I guess that does explain a

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.130 
tags so I guess that does explain a
little<00:06:30.500> bit<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:31.360> he<00:06:32.360> goes<00:06:32.540> for<00:06:32.660> the<00:06:32.720> least<00:06:32.960> or

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
little bit and he goes for the least or

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.600 
little bit and he goes for the least or
trying<00:06:33.410> to<00:06:33.500> take<00:06:33.680> out<00:06:33.830> my<00:06:33.860> miss<00:06:34.190> Brett<00:06:34.370> but<00:06:34.550> I'm
