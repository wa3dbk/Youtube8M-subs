00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.430
 medicinal properties of garlic 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.980
 logical reasoning led me to 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.200
 interesting conclusion 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.740
 almost all vegetables have their own 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.520
 valuable substances capable of curing diseases 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.070
 man but cannot pass 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.430
 gastric barrier fermentation process 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.920
 the fermentation of the microflora of the stomach begins 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.330
 recycle all available 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.330
 stomach products including alcohol 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.769
 to engage them in the fermentation process of it 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.159
 first you need to dissolve 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.500
 stomach acid but at the same career 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.920
 the intestinal tract goes away anyway 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.650
 and then enters the blood and in humans 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 obesity starts to happen this 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.220
 the property of the body itself tells us 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.750
 how can fermentation be avoided 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.059
 us the necessary substances of garlic and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.909
 in transit to translate their intestinal tract 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.330
 many passed rub garlic on 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.210
 a crust of bread adding salt then 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.970
 spread a layer of butter and with 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.580
 eat for hours sitting 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.340
 computer brain just does not have time 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.400
 recycle new information from 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.400
 dozens of sites and gradually begin to 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 manifest head noise dizziness and 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.940
 so on often drug in 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 garlic sandwich does not help 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.730
 perfectly mixed with fat given 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 case with butter and such 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.460
 some way 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.450
 then walks through the fermentation stage getting into 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.210
 intestinal tract 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.630
 after that it seeps into the blood and 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.940
 comes to the brain by stimulating vascular 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.540
 the system 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.730
 salt is needed to create 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.540
 osmotic pressure in solutions inside 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.580
 organism and thereby for example 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.240
 move nutrients inward 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.180
 cells through the membrane wall means 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.160
 garlic like other plants in 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.230
 actually has its healing 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.300
 properties 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.930
 just need to be able to transport them in 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.900
 an organism 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.750
 that's why fusel oils with alcohol 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.800
 freely passes the intestinal tract 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.800
 and then blood
