00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 If you squeeze a star in the middle of the world, butterflies will dance in some forest 

00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:59.300
 The key of the door that you protect The tale of embarrassing embarrassing story Even if I give up, the lion is strong 

00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:12.600
 I want to survive I want to survive 

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:30.900
 I want to survive Give me a wandering body I'm not sleepy until I show off my serious body 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:55.600
 The wind will eventually head east High pressure over the glaciers of this star 

00:01:55.601 --> 00:02:12.700
 The heart that drank the bitter water is a painfully distant story. 

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:25.700
 I want to survive I want to survive 

00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:45.500
 I want to survive Give me a wandering body I'm not sleepy until I show off my serious body 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.700
 What was born here What is here 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 I want to survive, I can't fill it, the light I'm afraid I'll forgive the life I have been drawn now 

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:45.800
 I won't sleep until I show my serious body I want to warm up and calm down with you next to me 

00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:59.400
 I want to survive I am a good girl I love you I want to wake up A life (life) is now attracted and matched 

00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:12.500
 Instead of madness, I'll pray for you I'm in love with you The guidance of the constellation ... 

00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:33.800
 I want to survive I still want to live I love you I can't sleep until I show you my heart
