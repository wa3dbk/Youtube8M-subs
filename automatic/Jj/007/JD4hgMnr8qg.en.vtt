boars<00:02:05.190> team<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.240> got<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> lot<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
boars team right now you got a lot of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
boars team right now you got a lot of
dams<00:02:06.960> coming<00:02:07.290> from<00:02:07.380> those<00:02:07.530> carries<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
dams coming from those carries and it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.820 
dams coming from those carries and it
looks<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> thrashers<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> well<00:02:09.360> for

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
looks like the thrashers it well for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
looks like the thrashers it well for
outbreak<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.459> means<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.269> can<00:02:12.330> be

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
outbreak and that means that it can be

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.089 
outbreak and that means that it can be
very<00:02:12.569> hard<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.170> murmured<00:02:13.560> ons<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.860> put

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
very hard for those murmured ons to put

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.160 
very hard for those murmured ons to put
their<00:02:14.250> drones<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.060> longer<00:02:15.450> range<00:02:15.599> targets

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
their drones on the longer range targets

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
their drones on the longer range targets
so<00:02:16.349> once<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.680> keep<00:02:16.830> your<00:02:17.010> semi<00:02:17.610> back<00:02:17.849> then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so once you keep your semi back then

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.399 
so once you keep your semi back then
they<00:02:18.510> won't<00:02:18.599> get<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> lock<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.170> put<00:02:19.319> those

they won't get a lock and put those

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.500 
they won't get a lock and put those
drones<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.980> well<00:02:20.430> bore<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.239> lose

alliance logo yet and as we've seen

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.180 
alliance logo yet and as we've seen
that's<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.139> pretty<00:03:12.319> big<00:03:12.500> towel<00:03:12.739> on<00:03:12.889> some<00:03:13.069> of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
that's a pretty big towel on some of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.430 
that's a pretty big towel on some of
these<00:03:13.280> uh<00:03:13.389> matchups<00:03:14.389> in<00:03:14.480> fat<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.840> far<00:03:15.019> but<00:03:15.319> in

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
these uh matchups in fat so far but in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.699 
these uh matchups in fat so far but in
this<00:03:15.530> case<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.920> looks<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.489> trend<00:03:17.269> of

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
this case it looks like the trend of

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.500 
this case it looks like the trend of
logo<00:03:18.709> lyst<00:03:18.920> teams<00:03:19.099> losing<00:03:19.340> may<00:03:19.670> be<00:03:19.730> broken<00:03:20.090> the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.009 
damage when any of the outbreak ships
wild<00:03:28.730> boar<00:03:28.879> is<00:03:29.000> continuing<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.629> take<00:03:29.810> some

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
wild boar is continuing to take some

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.990 
wild boar is continuing to take some
damage<00:03:30.199> but<00:03:30.530> at<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.099> slower<00:03:31.280> rate<00:03:31.459> than<00:03:31.609> earlier

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
damage but at a slower rate than earlier

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.789 
damage but at a slower rate than earlier
in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.150> match<00:03:32.269> yeah<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.260> looks<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
in the match yeah it looks like the

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.650 
in the match yeah it looks like the
outbreak<00:03:34.549> ships<00:03:34.790> have<00:03:34.910> mostly<00:03:35.150> polled<00:03:35.419> range

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
outbreak ships have mostly polled range

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.839 
outbreak ships have mostly polled range
the<00:03:35.930> brood<00:03:36.319> explore<00:03:36.680> wild<00:03:36.919> boars<00:03:37.069> is<00:03:37.340> now

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
the brood explore wild boars is now

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.729 
the brood explore wild boars is now
taking<00:03:38.180> all<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.389> damage<00:03:38.660> yeah<00:03:39.349> he's<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.530> about

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
taking all the damage yeah he's in about

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.199 
taking all the damage yeah he's in about
half<00:03:39.919> of<00:03:40.040> armor<00:03:40.280> Annie's<00:03:40.609> going<00:03:40.760> down<00:03:40.970> pretty

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
half of armor Annie's going down pretty

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.589 
half of armor Annie's going down pretty
quick<00:03:41.449> I<00:03:42.609> it's<00:03:43.609> really<00:03:43.910> early<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.419> match

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
quick I it's really early in the match

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.119 
quick I it's really early in the match
but<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.930> think<00:03:45.470> we<00:03:45.530> could<00:03:45.620> go<00:03:45.709> ahead<00:03:45.889> and<00:03:46.010> call

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
but I think we could go ahead and call

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.439 
but I think we could go ahead and call
this<00:03:46.280> one<00:03:46.430> for<00:03:46.579> outbreak<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> don't<00:03:47.120> think<00:03:47.239> wild

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
this one for outbreak I don't think wild

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.030 
this one for outbreak I don't think wild
boars<00:03:47.599> has<00:03:47.780> anything<00:03:48.169> going<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.680> for<00:03:48.919> them

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
boars has anything going on for them

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.759 
boars has anything going on for them
right<00:03:49.160> now<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.489> would<00:03:49.609> require<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:50.470> pretty<00:03:51.470> big

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
right now it would require a pretty big

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.439 
right now it would require a pretty big
swing<00:03:52.129> for<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.489> go<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.639> other<00:03:52.699> way<00:03:52.819> if<00:03:53.180> say

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
swing for it to go the other way if say

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.819 
swing for it to go the other way if say
outbreak<00:03:53.840> lost<00:03:54.139> a<00:03:54.260> bunch<00:03:54.410> their<00:03:54.560> ships<00:03:54.739> to

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
outbreak lost a bunch their ships to

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.409 
outbreak lost a bunch their ships to
boundary<00:03:55.099> violations<00:03:55.639> that<00:03:55.730> would<00:03:55.940> do<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.209> but

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
boundary violations that would do it but

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.300 
boundary violations that would do it but
otherwise<00:03:57.079> yeah<00:03:57.379> I<00:03:57.440> think<00:03:57.680> they<00:03:57.919> look<00:03:58.160> like

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
otherwise yeah I think they look like

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.920 
otherwise yeah I think they look like
they're<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.669> very<00:03:58.910> solid<00:03:59.299> controlled<00:03:59.599> as<00:03:59.750> much

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
they're in very solid controlled as much

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.780 
they're in very solid controlled as much
it<00:04:00.230> easy<00:04:01.040> Vaughn<00:04:01.190> line<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.549> never<00:04:01.699> know

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
it easy Vaughn line you never know

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.909 
it easy Vaughn line you never know
what's<00:04:01.970> going<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.120> happen<00:04:02.419> in<00:04:02.629> space<00:04:03.019> but<00:04:03.560> you

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
what's going to happen in space but you

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.199 
what's going to happen in space but you
can<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.160> a<00:04:04.220> pretty<00:04:04.400> good<00:04:04.459> prediction<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.180> I

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
can have a pretty good prediction and I

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.849 
can have a pretty good prediction and I
like<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:05.959> way<00:04:06.139> outbreaks<00:04:06.440> looking<00:04:06.680> right<00:04:06.829> now

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
like the way outbreaks looking right now

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.280 
like the way outbreaks looking right now
fruit<00:04:07.370> ticks<00:04:07.579> on<00:04:07.760> wild<00:04:08.030> boar<00:04:08.150> side<00:04:08.389> is<00:04:08.690> low<00:04:09.019> in

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
fruit ticks on wild boar side is low in

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.170 
fruit ticks on wild boar side is low in
armor<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.699> he's<00:04:11.510> almost<00:04:11.659> dead<00:04:12.159> and<00:04:13.159> still<00:04:13.970> a

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
armor and he's almost dead and still a

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.430 
armor and he's almost dead and still a
little<00:04:14.480> bit<00:04:14.629> of<00:04:14.690> damage<00:04:14.840> going<00:04:15.199> on<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.349> the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
little bit of damage going on to the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.069 
little bit of damage going on to the
carries<00:04:15.829> for<00:04:16.099> outbreak<00:04:16.849> he<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.449> shield<00:04:17.720> traore

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
carries for outbreak he is shield traore

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.180 
carries for outbreak he is shield traore
he<00:04:18.169> should<00:04:18.530> be<00:04:18.620> shield<00:04:18.859> tank<00:04:19.039> with<00:04:19.159> the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
he should be shield tank with the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.860 
he should be shield tank with the
scimitars<00:04:19.549> there<00:04:19.760> so<00:04:20.150> if<00:04:20.359> he<00:04:20.449> does<00:04:20.659> go<00:04:20.840> into

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
scimitars there so if he does go into

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.080 
scimitars there so if he does go into
armor<00:04:21.289> he'll<00:04:21.440> go<00:04:21.620> down<00:04:21.650> pretty<00:04:21.949> quickly<00:04:22.159> but

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
armor he'll go down pretty quickly but

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.370 
armor he'll go down pretty quickly but
it<00:04:23.449> doesn't<00:04:23.810> look<00:04:23.870> like<00:04:23.930> he's<00:04:24.080> taking<00:04:24.139> a<00:04:24.320> lot

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
it doesn't look like he's taking a lot

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.629 
it doesn't look like he's taking a lot
of<00:04:24.440> damage<00:04:24.650> possibly<00:04:24.919> just<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.280> few<00:04:25.400> groans

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
of damage possibly just a few groans

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.010 
of damage possibly just a few groans

boars I'm looking over the studio
commentators<00:04:29.060> right<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:30.440> want

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
commentators right now and I just want

to<00:04:30.590> say<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.740> think<00:04:30.860> should<00:04:31.639> do<00:04:31.789> is<00:04:32.150> cuter<00:04:32.750> than

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
to say I think should do is cuter than

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.780 
to say I think should do is cuter than
kill<00:04:34.310> to

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790
