more<00:01:39.990> damage<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.310> sure<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.610> twice

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
more damage I'm not sure if it's twice

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
more damage I'm not sure if it's twice
as<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> does<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.140> damage

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
as much but it does a lot more damage

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920 
as much but it does a lot more damage
its<00:01:44.189> velocity<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.479> faster<00:01:45.720> than

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
its velocity is so much faster than

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
its velocity is so much faster than
regular<00:01:46.170> ball<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.740> almost<00:01:46.979> goes<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
regular ball with almost goes like you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.539 
regular ball with almost goes like you
know<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.270> straight<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.770> fast<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
know like straight on it's that fast and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.100 
know like straight on it's that fast and
then<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.479> also<00:01:51.630> on

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
then it also on

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.090 
then it also on
the<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.120> oh<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.630> UM<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.440> efficiency

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
the what is it oh the UM the efficiency

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.370 
the what is it oh the UM the efficiency
of<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> bow<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.640> actually<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.090> lot<00:01:58.330> more<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.290> it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
of the bow is actually a lot more so it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.980 
of the bow is actually a lot more so it
is<00:01:59.440> definitely<00:01:59.740> worth<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.850> use<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:01.600> bow

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
is definitely worth it to use this bow

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.620 
is definitely worth it to use this bow
so<00:02:02.830> I<00:02:02.860> just<00:02:03.130> wanted<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.580> UM<00:02:03.790> try<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.570> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
so I just wanted to UM try it on on a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.510 
so I just wanted to UM try it on on a
couple<00:02:05.050> creepers<00:02:05.500> so<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.740> set<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.070> couple<00:02:06.310> on

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
couple creepers so I set a couple on

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.680 
couple creepers so I set a couple on
this<00:02:06.730> black<00:02:07.030> set<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.870> down<00:02:07.900> ah<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.390> hell

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
this black set it down ah what the hell

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.590 
this black set it down ah what the hell
I<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:11.410> had<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:11.890> 50<00:02:12.340> creepers<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.060> ok<00:02:13.570> I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
I I had like 50 creepers on that ok I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.650 
I I had like 50 creepers on that ok I
will<00:02:13.780> be<00:02:14.020> back<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.770> minute<00:02:15.480> already<00:02:16.480> guys

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
will be back in one minute already guys

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.520 
will be back in one minute already guys
so<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> am<00:02:17.710> back<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.959> stupid<00:02:19.959> mechanics

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
so I am back and stupid mechanics

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.750 
so I am back and stupid mechanics
spawning<00:02:21.220> mechanics<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:24.459> we're<00:02:24.640> gonna

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
spawning mechanics but if we're gonna

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.210 
spawning mechanics but if we're gonna
really<00:02:25.209> try<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.660> now<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.500> want<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.920> let<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.130> guys

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
really try it now I want to let you guys

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.000 
really try it now I want to let you guys
know<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.660> just<00:02:28.930> found<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.860> it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
know I have just found this out and it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.460 
know I have just found this out and it
is<00:02:30.160> insane<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.420> set<00:02:31.660> down<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> block<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
is insane you can set down a block and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.110 
is insane you can set down a block and
then<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.920> put<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.459> start<00:02:33.700> placing<00:02:33.880> a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
then if you put if you start placing a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120 
then if you put if you start placing a
spawn<00:02:34.390> egg<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> corner<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.410> can<00:02:35.860> spawn<00:02:36.100> a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
spawn egg on the corner you can spawn a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.090 
spawn egg on the corner you can spawn a
trillion<00:02:36.850> Anton<00:02:37.200> mobs<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.739> can't<00:02:38.950> do<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
trillion Anton mobs but you can't do it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.440 
trillion Anton mobs but you can't do it
with<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.310> sheep<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.730> cows<00:02:39.850> because<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.300> take

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
with like sheep and cows because it take

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.970 
with like sheep and cows because it take
up<00:02:40.570> two<00:02:40.750> blocks<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.530> creepers<00:02:41.920> and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
up two blocks but like creepers and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.560 
up two blocks but like creepers and
stuff<00:02:42.900> boom<00:02:43.900> yeah<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.489> see<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.390> here's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
stuff boom yeah as you can see so here's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.960 
stuff boom yeah as you can see so here's
our<00:02:46.720> targets<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.410> today<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.890> as<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.850> can<00:02:48.940> see

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
our targets for today and as you can see

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.960 
our targets for today and as you can see
it's<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.780> much<00:02:50.050> faster<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.430> takes<00:02:51.640> papers

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
it's so much faster and it takes papers

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.940 
it's so much faster and it takes papers
in<00:02:52.090> two<00:02:52.300> hits<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.750> that's<00:02:52.930> that's<00:02:53.260> good<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
in two hits so that's that's good you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.860 
in two hits so that's that's good you
think<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.310> usually<00:02:54.580> takes<00:02:54.790> three<00:02:55.209> or<00:02:55.390> four

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
think it usually takes three or four

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.840 
think it usually takes three or four
with<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> regular<00:02:56.770> ball<00:02:57.070> i'm<00:02:57.160> not<00:02:57.280> sure<00:02:57.519> correct

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
with a regular ball i'm not sure correct

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.780 
with a regular ball i'm not sure correct
me<00:02:58.030> in<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.120> comments<00:02:59.040> but<00:03:00.040> yeah<00:03:00.400> check<00:03:00.760> that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
me in the comments but yeah check that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.170 
me in the comments but yeah check that
out<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.810> fast<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.700> can<00:03:03.940> see<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
out it is so fast and as you can see the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.120 
out it is so fast and as you can see the
efficiency<00:03:04.690> at<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> bottom<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.290> still<00:03:05.620> full

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
efficiency at the bottom is still full

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.520 
efficiency at the bottom is still full
green<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.850> mean<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.690> look<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.049> that's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
green I mean just look at that that's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.710 
green I mean just look at that that's
like<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> regular<00:03:08.950> bow<00:03:09.190> right<00:03:09.370> there<00:03:09.850> just<00:03:10.510> me

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
like a regular bow right there just me

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110 
like a regular bow right there just me
going<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:10.989> half<00:03:11.470> acid<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.640> that's<00:03:12.790> really

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
going like half acid so that's really

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.150 
going like half acid so that's really
cool<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:13.900> go<00:03:14.049> full<00:03:14.320> speed<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.920> just

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
cool and you just go full speed and just

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030 
cool and you just go full speed and just
put<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.940> mean<00:03:16.450> like<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:17.080> abnormal<00:03:17.680> Bowl<00:03:17.890> you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
put I mean like for abnormal Bowl you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.160 
put I mean like for abnormal Bowl you
have<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.220> aim<00:03:18.370> kind<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.730> high<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.750> get<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.019> but

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
have to aim kind of high to get it but

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.810 
have to aim kind of high to get it but
literally<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.560> aim<00:03:20.860> directly<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.640> that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
literally I aim directly on that

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.820 
literally I aim directly on that
creepers<00:03:22.180> head<00:03:22.330> from<00:03:22.510> here<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.900> boom<00:03:23.380> hits

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
creepers head from here and boom hits

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.520 
creepers head from here and boom hits
him<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.820> absolutely<00:03:25.660> love<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.380> would

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
him so I absolutely love this this would
