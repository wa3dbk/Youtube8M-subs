much of a difference I didn't lose more

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.370 
much of a difference I didn't lose more
than<00:03:48.049> regular<00:03:48.769> more<00:03:49.489> than<00:03:49.670> usually<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:51.140> yeah

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
than regular more than usually but yeah

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.710 
than regular more than usually but yeah
but<00:03:51.650> remember<00:03:52.010> how<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.190> said<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.910> last<00:03:53.360> time<00:03:53.540> I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
but remember how I said that last time I

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.360 
but remember how I said that last time I
was<00:03:54.019> doing<00:03:54.290> my<00:03:54.320> hair<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.829> there<00:03:54.980> was<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.160> much

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
was doing my hair and there was a much

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.509 
was doing my hair and there was a much
breakage<00:03:56.049> well<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:58.010> must<00:03:58.190> have<00:03:58.340> been<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
breakage well it must have been the

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.640 
breakage well it must have been the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
product but what kills me is that that
