ASM one has been highly requested by you

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.620 
ASM one has been highly requested by you
guys<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.520> absolute<00:00:21.090> melt<00:00:21.300> machine

so<00:00:22.080> without<00:00:22.199> further<00:00:22.320> ado<00:00:22.740> let's<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.220> hop

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so without further ado let's go and hop

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
so without further ado let's go and hop
right<00:00:23.580> into<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> class<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> first

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
right into the class at up so the first

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.630 
right into the class at up so the first
step<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> course<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> go<00:00:26.310> ahead<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.580> throw

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
step is of course to go ahead and throw

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.370 
step is of course to go ahead and throw
on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> ASM<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.960> let's<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.230> ahead<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
on the ASM one now let's go ahead and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.470 
on the ASM one now let's go ahead and
move<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> attachments<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> first

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
move on to attachments for the first

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089 
move on to attachments for the first
statments<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> use<00:00:31.679> advanced

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
statments we are going to use advanced

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.650 
statments we are going to use advanced
rifling<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.000> i<00:00:33.090> said<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> an

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
rifling because like i said this is an

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.840 
rifling because like i said this is an
SMG<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> struggle<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.250> longer<00:00:35.520> ages

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
SMG and it can struggle at longer ages

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.250 
SMG and it can struggle at longer ages
so<00:00:36.210> advanced<00:00:36.450> rifling<00:00:36.780> will<00:00:36.960> help<00:00:37.110> increase

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so advanced rifling will help increase

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
so advanced rifling will help increase
that<00:00:37.559> range<00:00:37.800> help<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.430> bullets<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.790> target

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that range help your bullets on target

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.100 
that range help your bullets on target
and<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.629> hit<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.840> shots

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
fire now I personally prefer extended

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.490 
fire now I personally prefer extended
mags<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.780> aim<00:01:00.960> isn't<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> best

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
mags just because my aim isn't the best

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200

and<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> reload<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.640> often

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and I don't like to reload that often

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.609 
and I don't like to reload that often
when<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.660> streaks<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> makes

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
when going on streaks it kind of makes

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
when going on streaks it kind of makes
me<00:01:04.739> less<00:01:04.890> vulnerable<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> guys

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
me less vulnerable but if you guys

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.640 
me less vulnerable but if you guys
prefer<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.720> know<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:07.020> increased<00:01:07.470> fire

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
prefer you know to have increased fire

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
prefer you know to have increased fire
rate<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.100> would<00:01:08.220> definitely<00:01:08.369> suggest

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
rate then I would definitely suggest

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820 
rate then I would definitely suggest

now that we have the perks all the way

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
now that we have the perks all the way
the<00:02:05.310> attachments<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> gun<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.689> only<00:02:06.869> thing

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.130 
left is really kill streaks now the
killstreak<00:02:09.239> setup<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> run<00:02:09.959> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
killstreak setup I like to run is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
killstreak setup I like to run is
non-lethal<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.160> people<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.640> back<00:02:11.790> out

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
non-lethal just so people don't back out

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.070 
non-lethal just so people don't back out
they<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:12.209> get<00:02:12.330> frustrated<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:12.930> your

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
they don't get frustrated when your

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.490

dominate

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
dominate

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.100 
dominate
so<00:02:14.100> i<00:02:14.130> would<00:02:14.340> suggest<00:02:14.490> using<00:02:14.820> UAV<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.720> system

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
so i would suggest using UAV and system

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.630 
so i would suggest using UAV and system
hack<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.890> EV<00:02:17.100> you're<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.490> able

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
hack with you EV you're going to be able

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.040 
hack with you EV you're going to be able
to<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.940> where<00:02:18.090> they're<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.210> at<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.540> times<00:02:18.630> on

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
to know where they're at at all times on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.450 
to know where they're at at all times on
the<00:02:19.110> mini-map<00:02:19.320> especially<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.100> update<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
the mini-map especially if you update it

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.010 
the mini-map especially if you update it
really<00:02:20.850> nice<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.150> threat<00:02:21.360> detection<00:02:21.660> in

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
really nice with threat detection in

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.350 
really nice with threat detection in
extra<00:02:22.620> time<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.760> system<00:02:24.120> hack<00:02:24.210> you're

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
extra time and then system hack you're

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.430 
extra time and then system hack you're
going<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.600> able<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> hear<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> enemies<00:02:25.320> if

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
going to be able to hear the enemies if

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.750 
going to be able to hear the enemies if

you have a good headset when there's

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.710 
you have a good headset when there's
just<00:02:26.910> some<00:02:27.000> acne<00:02:27.270> no<00:02:27.360> they're<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.660> be
