00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
some water fixture unit values for each

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
some water fixture unit values for each
of<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:54.870> items<00:00:55.079> we're<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> look<00:00:55.829> them

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of these items we're going to look them

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.639 
of these items we're going to look them
up<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.539> table<00:00:57.539> 6-4<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.280> take<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> minute<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
up in table 6-4 so take a minute and

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
up in table 6-4 so take a minute and
maybe<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.309> zoom<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.850> closer<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.359> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
maybe we can zoom a little closer so you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.560 
maybe we can zoom a little closer so you
can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.090> better<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
can see that a little bit better that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.050 
can see that a little bit better that
might<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:08.040> better<00:01:08.700> for

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
might be just a little bit better for

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.820 
might be just a little bit better for
you<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.689> okay<00:01:10.760> make<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:11.909> drawing

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
you there to see okay make your drawing

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.530 
you there to see okay make your drawing
then<00:01:13.830> we'll<00:01:14.100> pause<00:01:14.369> we'll<00:01:14.880> come<00:01:15.060> back<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
then we'll pause we'll come back and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
then we'll pause we'll come back and
I'll<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.810> some<00:01:16.110> dimensions<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.100> for

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I'll have some dimensions on there for

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.710 
I'll have some dimensions on there for
you<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.759> figure<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.330> lengths<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you so we can figure out the lengths of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.160 
you so we can figure out the lengths of
the<00:01:18.810> pipe<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:20.659> then<00:01:21.659> we'll<00:01:21.840> work<00:01:21.990> through

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the pipe and then we'll work through

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
the pipe and then we'll work through
this<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.740> we'll<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.009> we'll<00:01:23.189> size

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
this and what we'll do is we'll size

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:44.980 
this and what we'll do is we'll size
each<00:01:23.939> section<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> pipe<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.409> it

the video develop length was the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
the video develop length was the
distance<00:02:30.840> through<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.890> fittings<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.990> what

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the most remote fixture and I'm not sure

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.030 
the most remote fixture and I'm not sure
if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.959> tell<00:02:43.020> which<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.980> don't

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
if you can tell which one it is I don't

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.560 
if you can tell which one it is I don't
want<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.490> don't<00:02:44.550> want<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.820> total<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.270> all<00:02:45.420> the

want it I don't want a total of all the
branches<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.380> wanted<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.880> distance

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
branches but I just wanted a distance

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.030 
branches but I just wanted a distance
from<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> meter<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.050> most<00:02:49.260> remote<00:02:49.650> branch

and I can tell you right now it looks

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.290 
and I can tell you right now it looks

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
calculate or just to see if you got the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.430 
calculate or just to see if you got the
same<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.240> did<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.510> our<00:03:03.570> on<00:03:03.960> our<00:03:03.990> develop

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
same as I did on our on our develop

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.740 
same as I did on our on our develop
liked<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.950> how<00:03:05.940> we<00:03:06.000> figured<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.390> develop

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
liked we how we figured the develop

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.710 
liked we how we figured the develop
length<00:03:06.960> we<00:03:07.110> figured<00:03:07.410> ten<00:03:07.650> feet<00:03:08.090> plus<00:03:09.090> ten<00:03:09.390> feet

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
length we figured ten feet plus ten feet

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.670 
length we figured ten feet plus ten feet
plus<00:03:10.350> eight<00:03:10.620> plus<00:03:10.920> 15<00:03:11.880> plus<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.630> four<00:03:13.020> plus

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
plus eight plus 15 plus that four plus

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580 
plus eight plus 15 plus that four plus
that<00:03:13.890> three<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:15.480> forests<00:03:15.960> from<00:03:16.020> here<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.380> here

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that three the forests from here to here

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.260 
that three the forests from here to here
and<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.770> looks<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.280> little<00:03:17.370> confusing<00:03:17.850> here<00:03:18.090> but

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
and it looks a little confusing here but

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.780 
and it looks a little confusing here but
the<00:03:18.360> three<00:03:18.630> foot<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.960> from<00:03:19.110> here<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.320> here<00:03:19.500> so

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
the three foot is from here to here so

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.260 
the three foot is from here to here so
my<00:03:20.790> addition<00:03:21.690> adds<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.320> 50<00:03:22.890> feet<00:03:23.160> now<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
my addition adds up to 50 feet now in a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.060 
my addition adds up to 50 feet now in a
developed<00:03:24.720> length<00:03:24.990> we<00:03:25.200> don't<00:03:25.410> consider<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
developed length we don't consider the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.650 
developed length we don't consider the
branch<00:03:26.340> lengths<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:26.880> only<00:03:27.030> consider<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
branch lengths we only consider the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.140 
branch lengths we only consider the
distance<00:03:28.050> from<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.470> mirror<00:03:28.770> through<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
distance from the mirror through the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.940 
distance from the mirror through the
most<00:03:30.420> remote<00:03:30.780> outlet<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.410> happens<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.800> be

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
most remote outlet and it happens to be

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.430 
most remote outlet and it happens to be
this<00:03:32.070> hose<00:03:32.280> bib<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.600> developed<00:03:34.140> length<00:03:34.320> is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
this hose bib so the developed length is

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.320 
this hose bib so the developed length is
going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.680> 50<00:03:35.070> feet<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.610> important

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
going to be 50 feet that's important

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.110 
going to be 50 feet that's important
the<00:03:37.110> next<00:03:37.530> thing<00:03:37.680> I've<00:03:37.890> calculated<00:03:38.370> here<00:03:38.940> and

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
discussion that if we're over 80 psi we

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.290 
discussion that if we're over 80 psi we

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
to do this we wouldn't have any table to

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.170 
to do this we wouldn't have any table to
use<00:06:16.250> you'd<00:06:17.250> have<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.520> put<00:06:17.669> a<00:06:17.699> pump<00:06:17.940> in<00:06:18.060> there

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
use you'd have to put a pump in there

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.730 
use you'd have to put a pump in there
and<00:06:18.300> look<00:06:18.479> and<00:06:18.569> get<00:06:18.720> at<00:06:18.810> least<00:06:18.840> 30<00:06:19.259> psi

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740

going to have 62 psi and that means we

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.100 
going to have 62 psi and that means we

62<00:06:40.979> psi<00:06:41.460> so<00:06:41.669> this<00:06:41.909> is<00:06:42.090> where<00:06:42.270> we're<00:06:42.389> going<00:06:42.509> to

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
62 psi so this is where we're going to

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.459 
62 psi so this is where we're going to
be<00:06:42.979> 62<00:06:43.979> psi<00:06:44.550> so<00:06:44.849> let's<00:06:45.090> go<00:06:45.360> back<00:06:46.259> to<00:06:46.440> our

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:46.469 
be 62 psi so let's go back to our

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:49.730 
be 62 psi so let's go back to our
drawing<00:06:46.800> now<00:06:47.130> and<00:06:47.430> do<00:06:47.789> the<00:06:47.909> sizing<00:06:48.530> all<00:06:49.530> right

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
drawing now and do the sizing all right

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.379 
drawing now and do the sizing all right
now<00:06:49.949> here<00:06:50.550> is<00:06:50.759> how<00:06:50.789> you<00:06:51.000> sized<00:06:51.509> it<00:06:51.840> at<00:06:53.389> segment

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
now here is how you sized it at segment

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.350 
now here is how you sized it at segment
number<00:06:54.570> one<00:06:55.190> we<00:06:56.190> have<00:06:56.219> to<00:06:56.370> ask<00:06:56.610> ourselves<00:06:56.820> how

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
number one we have to ask ourselves how

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.689 
number one we have to ask ourselves how
many<00:06:57.719> water<00:06:58.199> fixture<00:06:58.680> units<00:06:59.009> is<00:06:59.159> this<00:06:59.370> length

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
many water fixture units is this length

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.420 
many water fixture units is this length
of<00:06:59.880> pipe<00:07:00.060> carrying<00:07:00.840> well<00:07:01.710> this<00:07:02.070> length<00:07:02.310> of

the pressure range table of over 60 psi
now<00:07:29.460> if<00:07:29.639> you'll<00:07:29.819> notice<00:07:29.909> at<00:07:30.599> the<00:07:30.719> top<00:07:30.960> of<00:07:31.139> the

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
now if you'll notice at the top of the

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.430 
now if you'll notice at the top of the
column<00:07:32.030> our<00:07:33.030> developed<00:07:33.630> length<00:07:33.900> we<00:07:34.080> stated

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
column our developed length we stated

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.200 
column our developed length we stated
was<00:07:34.560> 50<00:07:35.069> but<00:07:35.250> there's<00:07:35.400> not<00:07:35.520> a<00:07:35.580> 50<00:07:35.880> it's<00:07:36.120> in

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
was 50 but there's not a 50 it's in

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.649 
was 50 but there's not a 50 it's in
between<00:07:36.330> the<00:07:36.569> 40<00:07:37.169> and<00:07:37.319> the<00:07:37.409> 60<00:07:38.180> so<00:07:39.180> we<00:07:39.300> use<00:07:39.479> the

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:39.659 
between the 40 and the 60 so we use the

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.040 
between the 40 and the 60 so we use the
60<00:07:40.050> column<00:07:40.500> we<00:07:41.190> come<00:07:41.400> down<00:07:41.610> till<00:07:41.849> we<00:07:42.000> find<00:07:42.330> for

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050 
60 column we come down till we find for

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.800 
60 column we come down till we find for
water<00:07:43.380> fixture<00:07:43.889> units<00:07:44.250> and<00:07:44.520> you'll<00:07:45.510> notice

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
water fixture units and you'll notice

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.970 
water fixture units and you'll notice
that<00:07:46.260> it<00:07:46.560> is<00:07:46.849> 7

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:47.980 
that it is 7

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.160 
that it is 7
there's<00:07:48.550> a<00:07:48.610> seven<00:07:48.910> there<00:07:49.210> well<00:07:49.420> for<00:07:49.690> waterfix

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.170 
there's a seven there well for waterfix

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.230 
there's a seven there well for waterfix
your<00:07:50.350> unit<00:07:50.530> is<00:07:50.650> less<00:07:50.830> than<00:07:51.010> seven<00:07:51.370> so<00:07:51.940> we<00:07:52.060> use

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 
your unit is less than seven so we use

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.140 
your unit is less than seven so we use
the<00:07:52.390> seven<00:07:52.840> and<00:07:53.040> our<00:07:54.040> building<00:07:54.490> supply<00:07:54.880> or

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.150 
the seven and our building supply or

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.210 
the seven and our building supply or
branch<00:07:55.540> is<00:07:55.900> one<00:07:56.470> half<00:07:56.740> inch<00:07:57.040> and<00:07:58.740> we'll<00:07:59.740> let's

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.610 
branch is one half inch and we'll let's
look<00:08:00.400> at<00:08:00.520> that<00:08:00.670> on<00:08:00.910> the<00:08:01.060> tick<00:08:01.240> on<00:08:01.270> the<00:08:01.500> let's<00:08:02.500> go

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.620 
look at that on the tick on the let's go

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.290 
look at that on the tick on the let's go
actually<00:08:02.800> go<00:08:03.100> to<00:08:03.160> the<00:08:03.400> chart<00:08:03.700> and<00:08:03.880> look<00:08:04.030> at<00:08:04.180> it

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.300 
actually go to the chart and look at it

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.310 
actually go to the chart and look at it
but<00:08:04.390> we're<00:08:04.540> going<00:08:04.630> to<00:08:04.690> look<00:08:04.870> up<00:08:05.020> and<00:08:05.230> we're

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320 
but we're going to look up and we're

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.850 
but we're going to look up and we're
going<00:08:05.440> to<00:08:05.470> verify<00:08:06.010> one<00:08:06.880> half-inch<00:08:07.650> let's<00:08:08.650> take
