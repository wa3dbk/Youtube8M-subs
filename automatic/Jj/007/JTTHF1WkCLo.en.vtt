00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.160

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
believe if Seattle win this game I think

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.290 
believe if Seattle win this game I think
they've<00:03:58.320> basically<00:03:58.770> assured<00:03:59.490> themselves<00:03:59.970> one

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
they've basically assured themselves one

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.650 
they've basically assured themselves one
of<00:04:00.480> those<00:04:00.630> three<00:04:00.840> spots<00:04:01.170> all<00:04:01.740> right<00:04:01.920> moving<00:04:02.280> on

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
facing the Philadelphia unions and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.410 
facing the Philadelphia unions and
filled<00:04:08.160> off<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.280> union<00:04:08.550> team<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.270> we've

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
filled off a union team that we've

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.180 
filled off a union team that we've
mentioned<00:04:09.630> has<00:04:09.990> dropped<00:04:10.380> some<00:04:10.560> points<00:04:10.950> lately

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
mentioned has dropped some points lately

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.500 
mentioned has dropped some points lately
can<00:04:11.730> they<00:04:11.850> get<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.090> full<00:04:12.270> three<00:04:12.480> points

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
can they get the full three points

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.750 
can they get the full three points
against<00:04:13.200> Portland<00:04:13.620> yeah<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.160> Timbers<00:04:14.550> can

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
against Portland yeah the Timbers can

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.360 
against Portland yeah the Timbers can
actually<00:04:15.210> catch<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.230> Philadelphia<00:04:16.799> Union<00:04:16.860> in

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
actually catch the Philadelphia Union in

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.220 
actually catch the Philadelphia Union in
the<00:04:17.640> standings<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.299> win<00:04:18.540> but<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:18.930> think

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
the standings with a win but I think

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.660 
the standings with a win but I think
more<00:04:19.350> importantly<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.860> Portland<00:04:20.250> they<00:04:20.489> need

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
more importantly for Portland they need

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.280 
more importantly for Portland they need
to<00:04:20.790> make<00:04:20.940> sure<00:04:20.970> Philadelphia<00:04:21.810> doesn't<00:04:22.080> escape

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
to make sure Philadelphia doesn't escape

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.410 
to make sure Philadelphia doesn't escape
and<00:04:22.680> get<00:04:23.070> away<00:04:23.130> from<00:04:23.430> them<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.030> they<00:04:24.180> need<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
and get away from them so they need to

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.720 
and get away from them so they need to
at<00:04:24.540> least<00:04:24.570> get<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.140> draw<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:25.980> hoping<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
at least get a draw well hoping that

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.670 
at least get a draw well hoping that
they<00:04:27.030> can<00:04:27.060> keep<00:04:27.750> Philadelphia<00:04:28.290> from<00:04:28.470> gaining

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
they can keep Philadelphia from gaining

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.380 
they can keep Philadelphia from gaining
too<00:04:28.890> many<00:04:29.040> points<00:04:29.490> will<00:04:29.730> be<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:30.030> other<00:04:30.180> two

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
too many points will be the other two

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.760
