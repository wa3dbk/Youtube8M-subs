asked you earlier is it hard to believe

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
asked you earlier is it hard to believe
that<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.880> you're<00:00:42.300> getting<00:00:42.510> ready<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.870> start

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that this you're getting ready to start

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.900 
that this you're getting ready to start
your<00:00:43.260> senior<00:00:43.590> season<00:00:43.740> then<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.250> mean<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.730> really

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
your senior season then I mean it really

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.860 
your senior season then I mean it really
is<00:00:45.080> times<00:00:46.080> just<00:00:46.380> flown<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:46.740> so<00:00:47.340> fast<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:48.060> I

is times just flown by so fast and I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110

my coaches I've had three different
position<00:01:10.499> coaches<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.069> every<00:01:11.429> one<00:01:11.579> of<00:01:11.609> them

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
position coaches and every one of them

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.179

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
have taught me new things and they've

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.899 
have taught me new things and they've
helped<00:01:14.909> me<00:01:15.499> sharpen<00:01:16.499> my<00:01:16.649> skills<00:01:16.729> well<00:01:17.729> this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
helped me sharpen my skills well this

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
helped me sharpen my skills well this
will<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.149> your<00:01:18.329> one<00:01:18.479> third<00:01:18.749> defense<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.409> three

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
will be your one third defense in three

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.399 
will be your one third defense in three
years<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.999> the<00:01:21.270> fourth<00:01:21.630> fourth<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> four

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
years I think the fourth fourth and four

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.039 
years I think the fourth fourth and four
yeah<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.850> think<00:01:23.939> my<00:01:24.359> first<00:01:24.749> two<00:01:25.020> years

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
yeah because I think my first two years

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.169 
yeah because I think my first two years
it<00:01:25.770> changed<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:26.399> freshman<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.999> sophomore

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
it changed from freshman to sophomore

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.279 
it changed from freshman to sophomore
year<00:01:27.719> so<00:01:28.369> is<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.789> big<00:01:30.119> change<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
year so is there a big change from the

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:32.859 
year so is there a big change from the
philosophy<00:01:31.859> last<00:01:32.100> year<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.399> what<00:01:32.549> Coach

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
philosophy last year to what Coach

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.849 
philosophy last year to what Coach
Blackwell<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.990> coach<00:01:34.139> Hall<00:01:34.350> want<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.709> this

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
Blackwell and coach Hall want to do this

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.489 
Blackwell and coach Hall want to do this
year<00:01:35.100> uh-uh<00:01:35.639> I<00:01:36.030> mean<00:01:36.569> really<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> all

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
year uh-uh I mean really when it all

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.980 
year uh-uh I mean really when it all
boils<00:01:37.709> down<00:01:37.889> to<00:01:38.069> it<00:01:38.490> there's<00:01:39.359> nothing<00:01:39.689> really

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
boils down to it there's nothing really

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
boils down to it there's nothing really
much<00:01:40.409> different<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.979> every<00:01:41.520> defense<00:01:41.969> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
much different in every defense is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.800 
much different in every defense is
philosophy<00:01:43.109> I<00:01:43.139> guess<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.709> say<00:01:43.889> but

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
philosophy I guess you could say but

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.459 
philosophy I guess you could say but
just<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:46.219> different<00:01:47.240> way<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.109> call<00:01:49.289> the

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
just some different way way we call the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.809 
just some different way way we call the
different<00:01:49.590> plays<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.219> stuff<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.670> bad

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
different plays and stuff that's bad

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.660 
different plays and stuff that's bad
that<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.779> different<00:01:52.380> dustin<00:01:53.189> gaiden<00:01:53.459> when<00:01:53.579> we

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that is different dustin gaiden when we

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.699 
that is different dustin gaiden when we
let<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.029> know<00:01:54.209> that<00:01:54.539> he<00:01:54.899> had<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.229> sex<00:01:55.560> than

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
let you know that he had more sex than

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.949 
let you know that he had more sex than
you<00:01:55.950> did<00:01:56.130> last<00:01:56.159> year<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.969> did<00:01:57.149> finish<00:01:57.509> second

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
you did last year you did finish second

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.929

school days oh it really didn't well he
was<00:04:04.890> from<00:04:05.040> Hoover<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.310> smoked<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:06.090> never

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209

was from Hoover I smoked like we never
played<00:04:06.570> each<00:04:06.750> other<00:04:06.959> but<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> guess<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.530> was

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
played each other but I guess it was

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.320 
played each other but I guess it was
just<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.950> Hoover<00:04:08.220> OPA<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> deal<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.090> don't

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
just the Hoover OPA like a deal I don't

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.620 
just the Hoover OPA like a deal I don't
know

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
know

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.050 
know
but<00:04:10.020> uh<00:04:10.050> yeah<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.550> coaches<00:04:11.910> thought

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
but uh yeah and so the coaches thought

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.580 
but uh yeah and so the coaches thought
it<00:04:12.150> would<00:04:12.240> be<00:04:12.330> a<00:04:12.360> great<00:04:12.690> idea<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.230> make<00:04:13.440> us

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590
