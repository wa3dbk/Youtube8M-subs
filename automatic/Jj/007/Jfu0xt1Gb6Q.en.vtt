00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
me there's no better place actually to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.790

it's<00:02:08.640> very<00:02:09.000> well<00:02:09.210> balanced<00:02:09.600> because<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's very well balanced because of the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's very well balanced because of the
weight<00:02:10.470> distribution<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.340> mid-engine

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
weight distribution with the mid-engine

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.910 
weight distribution with the mid-engine
but<00:02:12.570> at<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> same<00:02:12.960> time<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.770> have

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
but at the same time as you just have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.550

you'll<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> chance<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> closer

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you'll have a chance to have a closer

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.729 
you'll have a chance to have a closer
look<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.370> our<00:02:27.120> new<00:02:27.420> Boxster<00:02:27.810> GTS<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.470> paying

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
look at our new Boxster GTS and paying

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.190 
look at our new Boxster GTS and paying
GPS<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.459> words<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:30.360> only<00:02:30.480> tell<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:30.989> much

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
GPS because words can only tell so much

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.780 
GPS because words can only tell so much
but<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.250> feed<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.520> by

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
but I think you have to feed it by

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.180 
but I think you have to feed it by
yourself<00:02:33.209> by<00:02:33.690> looking<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> car<00:02:34.440> then<00:02:34.920> go

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
yourself by looking in the car then go

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610 
yourself by looking in the car then go
to<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.459> car<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.930> perhaps<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.260> every<00:02:37.500> good

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
to the car and perhaps and every good

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.860 
to the car and perhaps and every good
rider
