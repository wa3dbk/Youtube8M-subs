00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
little bit more pressure on companies to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.060 
little bit more pressure on companies to
make<00:03:11.050> sure<00:03:11.200> they<00:03:11.350> develop<00:03:11.650> games<00:03:11.770> that<00:03:11.980> are

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070

development<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.740> has<00:05:12.250> been<00:05:12.880> surprising<00:05:13.389> to

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
development that has been surprising to

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.469 
development that has been surprising to
you<00:05:15.360> what<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.389> find<00:05:16.840> most<00:05:17.349> surprising<00:05:17.919> is<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:19.060> lot

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
you what I find most surprising is a lot

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.439 
you what I find most surprising is a lot
of<00:05:19.599> the<00:05:19.659> game<00:05:19.840> creators<00:05:20.699> are<00:05:21.699> fixed<00:05:22.330> on

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
of the game creators are fixed on

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.920 
of the game creators are fixed on
certain<00:05:23.199> concepts<00:05:23.979> when<00:05:24.520> creating<00:05:25.030> games<00:05:25.360> and

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
certain concepts when creating games and

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.920 
certain concepts when creating games and
I'm<00:05:26.590> just<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:27.240> find<00:05:28.240> it<00:05:28.360> really<00:05:28.419> difficult<00:05:28.539> to

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
I'm just I find it really difficult to

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.480 
I'm just I find it really difficult to
understand<00:05:29.380> why<00:05:30.389> they<00:05:31.389> can't<00:05:32.280> think<00:05:33.280> outside

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
understand why they can't think outside

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.030 
understand why they can't think outside
the<00:05:33.639> box<00:05:33.909> and

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
the box and

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040 
the box and
create<00:05:35.760> something<00:05:35.910> more<00:05:36.240> much<00:05:36.660> more<00:05:36.810> creative

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
create something more much more creative

and much more you know with imagination

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.920 
and much more you know with imagination
rather<00:05:41.970> than<00:05:42.210> trying<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.340> be<00:05:44.340> more<00:05:44.840> inside<00:05:45.840> the
