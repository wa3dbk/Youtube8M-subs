00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.170
 incontestable talent and is that even the

 mobile devices enjoyed 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.700
 surprises with the addictive and visually 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.280
 shocking infinity blade originality 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.769
 in conception and in form with others 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.319
 independent exponents bastion or 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.420
 deathspank and not so independent the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.230
 generation 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.060
 if we talk about reputable titles is 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 impossible to forget approaches so 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.920
 classics like mike a magic hero 6 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.080
 dragon quest 9 made of his with a 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.849
 title of extraordinary duration and is 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.370
 that the nintenderos have been very well 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.050
 treated in this sense if it would not be 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.000
 impossible to explain the launch of 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.250
 such nice games as mario paper 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.950
 stickers are as addictive as 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.019
 black and white pokemon 2 or so funny 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.640
 like mario and luigi trip to the center of 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.860
 bowser 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.230
 to accompany the combative waits 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.060
 with a great artistic section lost 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.130
 odyssey was a great demonstration that 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 playable tradition and visual beauty are 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.490
 compatible 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.520
 final fantasy 13 may be linear 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.110
 but graphically it turned out absolutely 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.120
 precious and ni no kuni was directly 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 an authentic dream come true 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.410
 cartoon under the control of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.720
 our command an anime spirit that does not 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.489
 it was isolated we know how the Nipponese are 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.709
 and luckily they did not leave us in peace 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.020
 thanks to works like blood dragon 'such 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.630
 of vesperia and the emotive eternal sonata 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.630
 based on the life of the composer shopper 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.889
 for those who like originality 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.349
 Tim Schafer pulled out of the hat the 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.180
 delirious costume quest bioware 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.370
 surprised even herself giving rise 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.560
 to sonic chronicles and the Japanese 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.930
 trace they tore their clothes for 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.099
 design resonance of fate that broke with 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.099
 the conventions of gender 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.580
 we're still missing something and the tactic 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.919
 because tactics over fire emblem and final 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.570
 fantasy tactics came back with ports and 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.120
 remakes to please the faithful 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.770
 strategists although that did not have 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.590
 a lot to do in front of a rival like 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.630
 valkyria chronicles a ip completely 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.490
 new with which sega made it clear to us that 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.960
 no grids were needed to create 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.960
 a good tactical rpg 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.500
 there was a time when that 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.390
 first person dungeons was very 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.610
 fashionable however the good 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.590
 customs have been lost in japan the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.690
 gender still possesses strength with 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.520
 adventures like ifrÃ¡n or dizzee and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.680
 experiments in the style of shin megami 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.680
 tensei strange journey 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.900
 but if we have to look for a great 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.610
 referent that is reading green rock a 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.260
 independent title that despite 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.780
 be created by just four 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.060
 people has been excellently received 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.830
 by critics who knows may the 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.000
 most traditional moriana action 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.000

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.530
 enough but you are right we are missing 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.449
