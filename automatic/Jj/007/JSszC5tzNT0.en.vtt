00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.690 
that's really up to you and that's what
it<00:02:23.790> looks<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:25.020> see<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.610> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
it looks like you see that and it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.640 
it looks like you see that and it
actually<00:02:26.850> tastes<00:02:27.390> good<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:30.650> so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
actually tastes good just like this so

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.940 
actually tastes good just like this so
that's<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.070> filling<00:02:33.230> before<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.560> start<00:02:34.830> your

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that's the filling before you start your

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.170 
that's the filling before you start your
pie<00:02:35.100> crust<00:02:35.130> you're<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.820> want<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> let<00:02:36.120> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
pie crust you're going to want to let it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.000 
pie crust you're going to want to let it
sit<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.810> about<00:02:36.930> 15<00:02:37.470> minutes

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
sit out for about 15 minutes

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.760 
sit out for about 15 minutes
and<00:02:38.100> then<00:02:38.850> what<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.540> before<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.530> roll

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
and then what I like to do before I roll

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.680 
and then what I like to do before I roll
it<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.280> use<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> little<00:02:42.209> bit<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.450> flour

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it out is just use a little bit of flour

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.370 
it out is just use a little bit of flour
I<00:02:43.050> sprinkle<00:02:43.590> some<00:02:43.770> flour<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> surface<00:02:46.350> you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
I sprinkle some flour on a surface you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.560 
I sprinkle some flour on a surface you
can<00:02:46.650> use<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> cutting<00:02:47.100> board<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:48.180> piece<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
can use a cutting board or a piece of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.940 
can use a cutting board or a piece of
marble<00:02:48.810> I'm<00:02:49.110> gonna<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> right<00:02:49.620> here<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.860> my

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
marble I'm gonna do it right here on my

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.460 
marble I'm gonna do it right here on my
clean<00:02:50.340> granite<00:02:50.970> counter<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:52.380> you're

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
clean granite counter and then you're

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.170 
clean granite counter and then you're
just<00:02:52.620> gonna<00:02:52.709> roll<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.430> I'm<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
just gonna roll it out so I'm going to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.880 
just gonna roll it out so I'm going to
show<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.390> those<00:02:54.630> steps<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.709> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
show you those steps I'm going to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.110 
show you those steps I'm going to
sprinkle<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.459> counter<00:02:57.030> with<00:02:57.660> some<00:02:57.959> flour

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
sprinkle the counter with some flour

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:09.809 
sprinkle the counter with some flour
take<00:03:00.120> out<00:03:00.270> my<00:03:00.420> crush<00:03:02.150> I'm<00:03:03.150> gonna<00:03:03.330> unroll<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.729 

roll<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:10.720> little<00:03:10.750> bit<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.180> little<00:03:13.739> and

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
roll it a little bit it's the little and

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.429 
roll it a little bit it's the little and
then<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.549> on<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:16.060> my<00:03:16.659> plate<00:03:16.959> I'm<00:03:17.200> just

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
then to get it on to my plate I'm just

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.160 
then to get it on to my plate I'm just
gonna<00:03:17.530> roll<00:03:17.829> it<00:03:17.980> up<00:03:18.069> like<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.870> bring<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:19.989> my

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
gonna roll it up like that bring in my

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.250 
gonna roll it up like that bring in my
pie<00:03:20.409> plate<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.120> then<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.390> gets<00:03:22.510> plopped<00:03:22.989> on

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
pie plate and then it gets plopped on

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.630 
pie plate and then it gets plopped on
right<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:25.140> magical<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
right like that magical and that's the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.350 
right like that magical and that's the
base<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.349> do<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.739> lattice<00:03:30.099> top<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:31.180> could

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
base now to do the lattice top you could

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.050 
base now to do the lattice top you could
take<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.569> lot<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.870> time<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.500> braid<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.730> dough

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
take a lot of time and braid the dough

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.750 
take a lot of time and braid the dough
in<00:03:34.360> between<00:03:34.810> each<00:03:34.930> other<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.859> I<00:03:35.890> do<00:03:36.040> sort<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.640> a

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
in between each other but I do sort of a

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640 
in between each other but I do sort of a
fake<00:03:37.060> lattice<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.780> I'm<00:03:38.079> gonna<00:03:38.230> show<00:03:38.409> you<00:03:38.470> how

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
fake lattice and I'm gonna show you how

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.190 
fake lattice and I'm gonna show you how
to<00:03:38.709> do<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.459> cut<00:03:42.730> my<00:03:42.879> slices<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.780> now

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
to do that so I cut my slices and now

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.500 
to do that so I cut my slices and now
I'm<00:03:44.319> gonna<00:03:44.500> put<00:03:44.799> my<00:03:44.980> pie<00:03:45.250> filling<00:03:45.280> into<00:03:45.909> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
I'm gonna put my pie filling into the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.569 
I'm gonna put my pie filling into the
base<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.230> then<00:03:47.920> I'm<00:03:48.010> gonna<00:03:48.129> just<00:03:48.310> show<00:03:48.519> you

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
base and then I'm gonna just show you

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.869 
base and then I'm gonna just show you
how<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.879> simply<00:03:49.389> lay<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.409> lattice<00:03:51.129> on<00:03:51.340> top<00:03:51.549> and

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
how to simply lay the lattice on top and

00:03:51.879 --> 00:04:03.449 
how to simply lay the lattice on top and
my<00:03:52.629> blueberries<00:03:53.200> are<00:03:53.319> going<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.859> here<00:04:02.040> okay<00:04:03.040> so

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
my blueberries are going in here okay so

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.339 
my blueberries are going in here okay so
my<00:04:03.609> berries<00:04:03.970> are<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.239> here<00:04:04.569> let<00:04:05.049> me<00:04:05.170> show<00:04:05.290> you

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
my berries are in here let me show you

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.289 
my berries are in here let me show you
how<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.560> do<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.829> lattice<00:04:06.129> before<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.000> put<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
how to do the lattice before you put the

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.629 
how to do the lattice before you put the
lattice<00:04:07.659> on<00:04:07.810> top<00:04:08.049> I'm<00:04:08.379> just<00:04:08.470> gonna<00:04:08.829> dot<00:04:09.190> my<00:04:09.400> pie

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
lattice on top I'm just gonna dot my pie

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.509 
lattice on top I'm just gonna dot my pie
with<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.480> little<00:04:10.599> bit<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.290> butter<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:12.040> this

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
with a little bit of butter and this

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.289 
with a little bit of butter and this
gives<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:13.090> really<00:04:13.599> rich<00:04:13.840> flavor<00:04:13.870> I<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:16.120> about

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
gives a really rich flavor I have about

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.140 
gives a really rich flavor I have about
two<00:04:16.539> tablespoons<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.320> butter<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:18.150> just

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
two tablespoons of butter I just

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.800 
two tablespoons of butter I just
sprinkle<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:19.780> around<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:22.090> I'm<00:04:22.270> gonna<00:04:22.449> start

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
sprinkle that around now I'm gonna start

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:38.770 
sprinkle that around now I'm gonna start
by<00:04:22.990> taking<00:04:23.169> every<00:04:23.860> other<00:04:24.070> piece

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.110 

so<00:04:39.780> now<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:39.930> have<00:04:40.140> all<00:04:40.380> of<00:04:40.740> my<00:04:41.100> strips<00:04:41.490> going<00:04:41.730> in

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
so now I have all of my strips going in

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.090 
so now I have all of my strips going in
opposite<00:04:42.600> directions<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.800> looks

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
opposite directions and it looks

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.310 
opposite directions and it looks
beautiful<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.970> mean<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.690> wouldn't<00:04:45.900> know<00:04:46.110> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
beautiful I mean you wouldn't know the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.960 
beautiful I mean you wouldn't know the
difference<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.100> didn't<00:04:47.430> take<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.760> time

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
difference that you didn't take the time

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.000 
difference that you didn't take the time
to<00:04:48.180> weave<00:04:48.390> it<00:04:48.540> in<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.750> out<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.170> then<00:04:49.740> with<00:04:49.920> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
to weave it in and out and then with the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.360 
you're gonna want to see the center
bubbling<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.140> that's<00:05:47.710> how<00:05:47.920> you<00:05:47.980> know<00:05:48.190> it's

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
bubbling and that's how you know it's

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
bubbling and that's how you know it's
