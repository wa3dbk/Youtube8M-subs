forwards<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.170> plug<00:01:50.350> goes<00:01:50.530> on<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.770> there

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
forwards and the plug goes on to there

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
forwards and the plug goes on to there
easy<00:01:51.430> as<00:01:51.579> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
easy as that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.880 
easy as that
we'll<00:01:53.049> just<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.320> look<00:01:53.500> underneath<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
we'll just have a look underneath the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.289 
we'll just have a look underneath the
canopy<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.340> show<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.579> what<00:01:54.729> it's<00:01:54.850> made<00:01:54.970> up<00:01:55.149> of

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
canopy to show you what it's made up of

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.420 
canopy to show you what it's made up of
and<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:56.259> see<00:01:56.439> there's<00:01:56.649> two<00:01:56.710> tiny<00:01:57.189> little

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
and you can see there's two tiny little

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.950 
and you can see there's two tiny little
grommets<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.180> sides<00:01:58.450> there<00:01:58.659> so<00:01:58.840> that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
grommets on the sides there so that

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.840 
grommets on the sides there so that
releases<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.350> canopy<00:01:59.710> just<00:02:00.399> very<00:02:00.579> carefully

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
releases the canopy just very carefully

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.290 
releases the canopy just very carefully
flick<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.390> off

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.020 

that<00:02:06.170> comes<00:02:06.410> off<00:02:06.560> there<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.550> then<00:02:07.790> underneath

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that comes off there and then underneath

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.940 
that comes off there and then underneath
you'll<00:02:08.360> see<00:02:08.540> just<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.170> motherboard<00:02:09.590> as

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
you'll see just the the motherboard as

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.460 
you'll see just the the motherboard as
antenna<00:02:10.520> on<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.760> top<00:02:11.470> pretty

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
antenna on the top pretty

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.750 
antenna on the top pretty
straightforward<00:02:13.100> but<00:02:13.220> that's<00:02:13.400> essentially

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
straightforward but that's essentially

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.580 
straightforward but that's essentially
what<00:02:14.060> makes<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.170> all<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.350> wonderful

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
what makes this to all the wonderful

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.160 
what makes this to all the wonderful
things<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.130> does<00:02:16.810> included<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.990> Box

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
things that it does included in the Box

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.410 
things that it does included in the Box
is<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.470> brand-new<00:02:18.890> USB<00:02:19.400> charger<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.300> is

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
is a brand-new USB charger so this is

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.090 
is a brand-new USB charger so this is
the<00:02:20.510> first<00:02:20.750> time<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.170> flat<00:02:21.380> or<00:02:21.530> plate<00:02:21.740> have<00:02:21.920> done

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the first time a flat or plate have done

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.070 
the first time a flat or plate have done
this<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.670> will<00:02:23.360> charge<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.870> little

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
this and this will charge up the little

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.160 
this and this will charge up the little
150<00:02:24.860> million<00:02:25.190> batteries<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.930> use<00:02:27.110> this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
150 million batteries and you use this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.410 
150 million batteries and you use this
from<00:02:27.350> your<00:02:27.470> laptop<00:02:27.830> from<00:02:28.040> your<00:02:28.130> PC<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.880> that

as you can see here we've got the dx6i

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.170 
as you can see here we've got the dx6i
er<00:02:42.920> which<00:02:43.130> will<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.340> more<00:02:43.490> than<00:02:43.550> adequate<00:02:43.790> for

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
er which will be more than adequate for

dynamic UX as you'll also see in our
flight<00:02:50.030> demo<00:02:50.390> video<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:51.410> demonstrate<00:02:51.950> how<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
flight demo video we demonstrate how the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.030 
flight demo video we demonstrate how the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
safe the new safe sterilization system

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.730 
safe the new safe sterilization system
works<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.090> that's<00:02:56.450> essentially<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.960> sensor

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
works and that's essentially a sensor

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.330 
works and that's essentially a sensor
assisted<00:02:58.610> flat<00:02:58.880> envelope<00:02:59.800> we<00:03:00.800> were<00:03:00.950> using<00:03:01.130> on

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
assisted flat envelope we were using on

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.550 
assisted flat envelope we were using on
the<00:03:01.430> DXi<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.600> runs<00:03:02.780> off<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.080> flap<00:03:03.290> switch

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
the DXi and it runs off the flap switch

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.950 
the DXi and it runs off the flap switch
so<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:03.980> cycle<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.970> whether<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.840> be

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
so you cycle that to get whether it be

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.750 
so you cycle that to get whether it be
an<00:03:06.410> assistant<00:03:06.650> flight<00:03:07.100> or<00:03:07.340> an<00:03:07.430> unassisted

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
an assistant flight or an unassisted

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.930 
an assistant flight or an unassisted
flat<00:03:08.770> that'll<00:03:09.770> determine<00:03:10.040> how<00:03:10.340> stable<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.850> is

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
flat that'll determine how stable it is

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.210 
flat that'll determine how stable it is
or<00:03:11.120> how<00:03:11.209> agile<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:13.040> that's

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
or how agile it is and that's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.540 
or how agile it is and that's
demonstrated<00:03:13.400> really<00:03:13.970> well<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.600> our<00:03:14.780> video

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
demonstrated really well in our video

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.490 
demonstrated really well in our video
then<00:03:16.550> any<00:03:16.700> QX<00:03:17.360> would<00:03:17.720> be<00:03:17.840> excellent<00:03:18.290> for

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
then any QX would be excellent for

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.740 
then any QX would be excellent for
indoors<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.520> float<00:03:19.730> around<00:03:19.850> our<00:03:20.060> warehouse<00:03:20.390> it

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
indoors we float around our warehouse it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.990 
indoors we float around our warehouse it
flies<00:03:21.020> really<00:03:21.410> well<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.580> two<00:03:22.730> flat

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
flies really well with the two flat

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.610 
flies really well with the two flat
modes<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.690> would<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.900> good<00:03:24.050> for<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.320> advanced

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
modes it would be good for the advanced

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.199 
modes it would be good for the advanced
pilot<00:03:25.130> wanting<00:03:25.370> something<00:03:25.640> really<00:03:25.880> agile
