00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello very good crazy of God ' 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.960
 Well, guys, what time, since 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.440
 we went up nothing of this type of videos 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.150
 This will have an analysis and 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.779
 prints of rayman legend as you know 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.300
 this platform game that came out does 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.920
 little as you see we are going to teach you a 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.279
 little what the menu goes what the 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.599
 It's worth it and now you can give 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.099
 your opinion in the comments as 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.840
 you are seeing all this from here of the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.610
 right are the worlds that you see there are 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.740
 one two three four five and six worlds 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.910
 and within each world as you see in the 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.610
 now after 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 there are many missions as you know this is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.480
 the second part that so much criticism has 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 received since initially I was going to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.400
 be exclusive to win but it has taken longer 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.280
 on leaving but we already have available for 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.199
 pc xbox playstation 3 and wii 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.150
 Then, as you can see, here we have what 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.600
 is the gallery of heroes that we have in 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.550
 the ring is to say that below 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.140
 here we start directly with everyone 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.210
 the powers that were unblocking the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.060
 rayman origins as you say the title 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 of origin origins and we are learning 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.750
 modern is something that we started the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.360
 history and here we are already laws are the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.940
 legend we already have all the powers 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.149
 As you can see there are a lot of characters 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.000
 true that does not validate much more than 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.619
 the one of manolo and its domes the vall of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 I recommend him a lot. 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.399
 for me it is one of my favorites the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 truth is a game that is not done 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.680
 bored this year have done a work of 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.140
 art as these are the challenges the challenges 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.690
 from online we also have challenges 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 newspapers that we can compete with the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.810
 community that is on the internet 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 that is to say 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.890
 every day there is a challenge a screen that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 less time is the base because it takes the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.200
 challenge of I can not enter because I do not 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.560
 I have the available tension 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.670
 but we have these quin football is a 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.619
 new game mode that they have made for 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.140
 play with your friends with the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.619
 screen that there is always is the same as 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.299
 you see 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.179
 I think that according to app right now I have 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.670
 friends connected as you see resists mete 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.599
 the ball and in the goal as they are 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.599
 equipment in red and blue 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.270
 and all this has that place 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.530
 I've tried with friends and the truth is 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.530
 laughs are normal 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.040
 and also tell you that it's a game almost 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.920
 infinite so you are going to see now 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.519
 it also has all as you see back to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.220
 origins here inside and you will say this that 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.720
 then most of the maps are me 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.530
 I would say that almost all the maps of the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.989
 rayman origins voucher remastered by 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.549
 so to say it in hd they will not be remastered 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.519
 because in the quality of the video they do not have 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.290
 a lot of quality but yes they adapt 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.750
 what are the graphs of these of this 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.389
 new game and then we have the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.609
 creatures that are that you were 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.170
 getting along the screen 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:14.010
 dragging with those scratches those that you 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.659
 they are giving and that they were not given lumix 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.159
 with them in euros and at levels 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.940
 unlock characters are shining 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.670
 a lot of things 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.080
 as I said the ones that are unlocked with 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.010
 the scratches the bars are obtained in 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.410
 each level 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.050
 now we are already explained everything that is 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.520
 the menu and all this we are going to teach 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.910
 a little screen is worth I think that the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.080
 analysis why this stays stays good 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.670
 but then the game as you see 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.190
 We have the main objective is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.410
 rescue the blue all pricks 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.570
 but we keep on calling and once the 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.000
 we also rescued the good currency as 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.920
 you see let's go through this one of the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.110
 last as you see four stars as 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.710
 Stress your dragon 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.510
 good as the load count added the 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.670
 bottle of the motion to start with a 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.080
 heart to not be bored of running 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.220
 and run 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.850
 let's go back to the day like this 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.850
 all right 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.510
 and it's worth 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.800
 the main novelty in pc in wii 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.110
 we had the characteristic that you 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.150
 could you with the gamepad move it worth 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.280
 true that it was a very good one here 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.610
 directly in a photo or indicates that 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.259
 let's sit down to move alone 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.860
 as in the levels at the graphic level they are 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.860
 now day of life 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.310
 As you can see, it looks a lot like what it is 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.310
 the king 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.330
 no no 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.400
 well to say the Uruguayans are the levels 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.220
 the quality and very fast levels 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.580
 very good levels of truth 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:08.480
 to the good of playing at the same time 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.480
 it's very good 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.480
 this is the mission game of truth that 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.480
 is that not 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.240
 the king value and money forever was 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.320
 one of the ovens revelation 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.020
 do not 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.760
 still have the colors very 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.660
 colorful a gameplay as it comes 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.790
 said is super dynamic your entity to 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.790
 playing cooperative has 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.160
 comparative saying has no character no 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.210
 has local decided cooperatives 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.210
 people on the same screen 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.540
 the hours the player can not play with 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.540
 your friends from your house 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:11.160
 the secondary 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.160
 it's new 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.900
 of our way zurera you have everything goes 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.030
 to go up let's play heroes is going up 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.010
 chapter only chapter with his girlfriend the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.740
 really fun if you want to be 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.740
 some laughter do not hesitate to pass the premises 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.940
 the truth 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.330
 do not 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.330
 and let me fly back 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.730
 I shut up 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.130
 as a boy I do not want something to be done 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.580
 because he already knows that we do not like 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.580
 videos 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:16.599
 be very long since the main thing is that 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.149
 if you want to play it right now if you 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:20.619
 you want to buy for abc in an extinction 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:21.460
 that the keys are coming out for about 15 

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:23.319
 euros and it's a totally game 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.960
 recommended since it can be a game 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:28.330
 almost infinite or boy here I say goodbye 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.159
 I am mike and remember other things 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.770
 have died gameplays to analysis 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.999
 videoblogs a boxing all here in the 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.330
 channel of the week consoles until the 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.330
 next
