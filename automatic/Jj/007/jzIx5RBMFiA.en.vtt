bring<00:02:42.170> out<00:02:45.160> made<00:02:46.160> by<00:02:46.340> bench<00:02:46.610> made<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:49.010> one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
bring out made by bench made this one

00:02:49.310 --> 00:03:04.430 
bring out made by bench made this one
spyderco<00:02:50.300> sage<00:02:50.830> one<00:02:52.840> carbon<00:02:53.840> fiber<00:02:55.030> I'm<00:02:56.030> ray

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.860 

and<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.310> San<00:03:05.580> remove<00:03:06.620> 710<00:03:08.300> very<00:03:09.300> similar<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
and the San remove 710 very similar to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:26.870 
and the San remove 710 very similar to
the<00:03:10.020> sebenza<00:03:10.440> actually

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.740 

so<00:03:27.540> basically<00:03:27.990> what<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.530> saying<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:30.510> is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
so basically what I'm saying is this is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.040 
so basically what I'm saying is this is
a<00:03:30.780> hundred<00:03:31.230> seventy<00:03:31.710> six<00:03:31.950> dollars<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:35.040> is

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
a hundred seventy six dollars that is

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:47.230 
a hundred seventy six dollars that is
360<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:38.100> right<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.480> tell<00:03:39.870> me<00:03:42.350> both<00:03:43.350> s30v

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.790 

actually<00:03:48.240> wait<00:03:48.450> though<00:03:48.720> sebenza<00:03:49.350> might<00:03:49.620> have

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
actually wait though sebenza might have

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.000 
actually wait though sebenza might have
it<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.160> star<00:03:50.400> be<00:03:50.580> five<00:03:50.880> VN<00:03:51.480> yes<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.440> does<00:03:52.470> all

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it I star be five VN yes it does all

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:07.910 
it I star be five VN yes it does all
right

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.160 

so<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.580> think<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.120> cevennes<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.690> not<00:04:09.840> really

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
so I think the cevennes is not really

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.789 
so I think the cevennes is not really
worth<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.890> me<00:04:12.800> because<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.930> locks<00:04:19.530> up

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
worth it on me because I it locks up

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.740 
worth it on me because I it locks up
nice<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.130> everything<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.850> like<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.299> alias

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
nice and everything just like that alias

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.400 
nice and everything just like that alias
the<00:04:23.240> clicking<00:04:24.240> sounds<00:04:24.600> different<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.230> know

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
the clicking sounds different you know

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.920 
the clicking sounds different you know
on<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.810> locking<00:04:28.290> sound<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:29.550> sounds<00:04:30.830> louder

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
on it the locking sound it sounds louder

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.780 
on it the locking sound it sounds louder
but<00:04:33.930> for<00:04:34.110> double<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.470> price<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:35.130> do<00:04:35.430> not<00:04:35.730> think

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
but for double the price I do not think

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.230 
but for double the price I do not think
it's<00:04:36.240> worth<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:37.490> mean<00:04:38.490> if<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.880> get<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
it's worth it I mean if you get the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:50.350 
it's worth it I mean if you get the
alias<00:04:40.940> it's<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.060> good<00:04:42.270> replacement<00:04:47.419> substitute

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
alias it's a good replacement substitute

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.719 
alias it's a good replacement substitute
