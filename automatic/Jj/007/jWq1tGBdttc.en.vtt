batter<00:01:06.460> in<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.850> ziploc<00:01:07.270> bag<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.840> then<00:01:07.930> cutting

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
batter in a ziploc bag and then cutting

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.590 
batter in a ziploc bag and then cutting
the<00:01:09.130> corner<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.730> and<00:01:09.760> then<00:01:10.210> just<00:01:10.450> like

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
the corner of it and then just like

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.990 
the corner of it and then just like
squeezing<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.260> out<00:01:11.440> into<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.190> donut<00:01:12.460> pan<00:01:12.670> so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
squeezing it out into the donut pan so

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:53.460 
squeezing it out into the donut pan so
it's<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.150> lot<00:01:13.300> easier
