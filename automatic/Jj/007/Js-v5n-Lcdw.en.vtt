ahead and tie it I'm the Vice yet I've

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.850 
ahead and tie it I'm the Vice yet I've
got<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> size<00:00:11.179> 12<00:00:12.179> b-17<00:00:12.990> five<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.559> would<00:00:13.740> do

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860

is<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.070> run<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:15.020> tying<00:00:16.020> thread<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:23.269> I'm

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
is just run on some tying thread and I'm

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.810 
is just run on some tying thread and I'm
going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> tie<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.289> some<00:00:25.500> red<00:00:25.680> holographic<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
going to tie in some red holographic you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.070 
going to tie in some red holographic you
don't<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.180> des<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.599> something<00:00:27.960> that's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
don't need des but something that's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
don't need des but something that's
change<00:00:28.439> through<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> makes<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.160> fly<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
change through it it makes it fly a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.110 
change through it it makes it fly a
little<00:00:29.550> bit<00:00:30.890> but<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.980> am<00:00:32.189> catching<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> little

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
little bit but I am catching a little

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
little bit but I am catching a little
bit<00:00:33.239> more<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.870> red<00:00:33.989> holographic<00:00:34.260> tie

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
bit more so some red holographic tie

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.479 
bit more so some red holographic tie
then<00:00:35.600> my<00:00:36.600> say<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> hook<00:00:37.170> shank<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.129> also

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
then my say to the hook shank and also

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.270 
then my say to the hook shank and also
some<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:39.320> vinyl<00:00:40.320> Reb<00:00:41.420> red<00:00:43.010> tie<00:00:44.010> they're<00:00:44.219> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
some little vinyl Reb red tie they're in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.709 
some little vinyl Reb red tie they're in
my<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> hooch<00:00:44.940> I'll<00:00:45.120> leave<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> little

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
my say to the hooch I'll leave a little

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.260 
my say to the hooch I'll leave a little
bit<00:00:46.250> just<00:00:47.250> behind<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.730> eyes<00:00:47.879> you've<00:00:48.149> got<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
bit just behind the eyes you've got a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.279 
bit just behind the eyes you've got a
tying<00:00:48.570> off<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:49.050> pull<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> thread<00:00:49.739> taut<00:00:57.289> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
tying off point pull the thread taut and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
tying off point pull the thread taut and
just<00:00:59.660> touch<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> holographic<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.649> yeah<00:01:01.969> thread

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
just touch a holographic in yeah thread

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
just touch a holographic in yeah thread
back<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> top<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> holographic

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
back up to the top to get a holographic

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.260 
back up to the top to get a holographic
and<00:01:06.830> overlapping<00:01:07.830> tones<00:01:10.939> stopping<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.000> little

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and overlapping tones stopping a little

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.640 
and overlapping tones stopping a little
bit<00:01:12.390> behind<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> eye<00:01:12.840> giving<00:01:13.170> yourself<00:01:13.500> some

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
bit behind the eye giving yourself some

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
bit behind the eye giving yourself some
space<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.310> need<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.580> space<00:01:14.790> for

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
space because you need some space for

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.929 
space because you need some space for
tying<00:01:15.270> off<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.780> you've<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:17.549> vinyls

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
tying off because you've got the vinyls

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.580 
tying off because you've got the vinyls
quite<00:01:18.390> thick<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.880> then<00:01:21.110> just<00:01:22.110> give<00:01:22.259> yourself

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
quite thick and then just give yourself

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:36.960 
quite thick and then just give yourself
a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:25.220> whip<00:01:26.220> finish<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.820> here

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:49.260 

and<00:01:37.970> just<00:01:39.909> bring<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.030> rib<00:01:41.180> up<00:01:44.049> touching<00:01:45.049> tones

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.840

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
covering all the holographic and then

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.700 
covering all the holographic and then
just<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.270> behind<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.890> walk<00:01:54.890> off<00:01:56.530> with<00:01:57.530> some
