recovery sell one of them and keep the
other<00:02:59.820> one<00:03:00.350> my<00:03:01.350> guesstimate<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.310> we'd<00:03:02.430> have

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
other one my guesstimate and we'd have

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.670

to<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.850> rental<00:03:03.060> expert<00:03:03.570> over<00:03:03.810> there<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.530> my

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
to get a rental expert over there but my

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.520 
to get a rental expert over there but my
guess<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.549> get<00:03:05.730> 40<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.209> 50,000<00:03:07.019> per

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
guess is you could get 40 to 50,000 per

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.650 
guess is you could get 40 to 50,000 per
unit<00:03:07.920> per<00:03:08.130> year<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.430> eighty<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.600> hundred

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
unit per year so eighty to a hundred

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.050 
unit per year so eighty to a hundred
thousand<00:03:10.350> rental<00:03:10.560> income<00:03:10.950> gross<00:03:11.730> rental
