00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 some years ago the group elisa 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 opened the ban on urban crossovers and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.950
 he did it with the juke at which time 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200
 then they have been joined by several 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
 competitors for example opel with the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 his cousin mocks the chevrolet tracks 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 renault with the capture and now this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 period 2008 although it has to be said that the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.619
 capture is more rival to this car than 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.020
 those of general motors since these 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 They can also carry 4x4 traction in the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 paris motor show of 2012 already 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 We could see the prototype of this 2008 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.539
 that as we said then is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.880
 basically a 208 over elevated and with 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.250
 rural claims but before 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.230
 get into full with 2008 we are going to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 do some history and numbers 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.149
 what the denominations mean 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 numbers that you use in your cars 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.399
 well the matter comes from also 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 paris hall but from 1929 when it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.670
 introduced 201 the 2 indicated the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.440
 segment of the car that is its size on 0 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 derived from the circular opening by the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 that got the lever to start 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.199
 the engines years before and that I take 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.910
 as a representative number of your brand 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.089
 to be told if not to ferdinand 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.579
 porsche 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.790
 was referring to the generation of that 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.970
 model 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.370
 so the recent 208 is the eighth 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.870
 generation of that utilitarian model and 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.520
 as the market mandates but has 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 tapped its platform to 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.920
 develop 2008 yes but because they are 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.450
 two zeros well the 0 extra is for 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.180
 differentiate cutting models 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 SUV and minivan so between 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.120
 the 2008 the 3008 the 4000 8 and the 5008 not 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.640
 it is surprising that the French brand 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.850
 have more 0-0 than the secret service 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.850
 British 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.010
 always go back to the model that concerns us 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.620
 the 2008 is practically 20 centimeters 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.260
 longer equal in width and 2 centimeters 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.790
 and a half higher than 208 in the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.680
 interior feels very similar to 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.000
 utilitarian but with some more space 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.250
 for the heads of the occupants 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 rear however it is said that 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.270
 neither one stand out in this 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.450
 aspect the trunk space also 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.940
 would be benefited by that greater length 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.420
 but despite being 58 liters more capable 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.250
 that the 208 their 338 stay in the area 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.509
 low of the table of rivals the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.600
 'red lantern' is worn by 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.790
 ridiculous 252 liters of iup that yes the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.350
 trunk of 2008 is very usable and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.090
 comfortable since the shapes are very 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.520
 regular and the loading mouth is 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.330
 quite low although the starting point 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.830
 is the same 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.860
 the interior design is not exactly 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.090
 just like the 208 to understand us is 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.400
 as if there were not in your unit or 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.320
 subtle shape with chrome moldings and 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 action air exits for example or 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.700
 this handbrake more typical of a 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.050
 fighter plane that of a car once 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.850
 those controls and if we want to find 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.740
 our usual driving position 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.130
 the truth is that it's a little weird like the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.860
 208 steering wheel is very small machado his 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 lower area was located one below but 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.210
 sorry that we see over him not 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.040
 in between, he's so tiny 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.630
 and it goes so low it seems that we are 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.550
 holding the steering wheel of the playstation 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.200
 then it's true that you get used to it 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.120
 because at the beginning you also go as a 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.920
 little shrunken and no matter how much you touch 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.390
 we have the regulations never 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.650
 we got to see the picture well 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.870
 watches 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.640
 Another delicate point is that of the screen 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.189
 touch where enough clumps 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.720
 functions is fine but will look for a 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.730
 radio station or a phone number 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.379
 on the agenda while we are circulating 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 it would be easy because you have to touch 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.290
 many times and in a very 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 small so it is recommended 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.239
 to learn well its handling in stopped in 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 the 1,008 behaves quite well and 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.629
 transmits good feelings the moron 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.430
 of the suspensions has good 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.069
 compromise between effectiveness and comfort 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.959
 it's comfortable on highways cintra well the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.090
 irregularities of the land and if we 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.609
 we focus on area of ​​curves we can 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.840
 say that the problem is agile 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.760
 can come because of the situation of 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.650
 seats in the lumbar area there is no 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.900
 problem but the upper back area 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.859
 is very discovered and it seems like 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.859
 let's get out of them 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.990
 the diesel engine 1.6 hdi 90 horsepower 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.080
 is quite capable almost anywhere 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.700
 circumstance above there is another 115 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.440
 horses but the little one is more than 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.110
 enough for day to day and do 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.220
 some excursions only if we travel to 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.770
 Through its load capacity 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 we will miss more power in addition 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.920
 has a very good response to casualties 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.990
 laps so we do not have to be 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.460
 changing gear every two times three 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.370
 we will appreciate because the lever 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.920
 changes has two very long routes 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.920
 It looks like a Volkswagen beetle from 1965 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.729
 has a start and stop system that 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.499
 along with the engine is so smooth fast and 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.180
 silent that sometimes we do not give ourselves 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.159
 realize that you are acting not as 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.150
 others that when they start or stop seems 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.150
 that we lose contact lenses 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.639
 and our unit that is equipped with 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.280
 the grip control system that optimizes the 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.570
 motor skills in case of low adherence 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.380
 We can choose between four types of 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.479
 firm asphalt snow sand and all roads 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.639
 that include mud or wet grass by 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.440
 example is a way to squeeze the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.389
 electronic and it seems very appropriate 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.100
 that this is done works pretty well 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.470
 and although 2008 is only 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.139
 front-wheel drive and that any 4x4 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.600
 will give you soups with waves defends with 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.100
 honor out of the asphalt that's why we're going to 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.669
 try to climb this sand ramp 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.139
 release in normal position to see what happens 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.639
 we are trying it in normal position 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.610
 which is the position that any car 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.970
 I would have the traction control act 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.970
 but 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.669
 we see that the car can not climb 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.669
 let's change now to position the a 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.540
 and we are doing well 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.210
 we climb 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.120
 and it has cost a bit more but at 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.590
 final we have achieved it and it is that 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.450
 depending on the position that we have 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.740
 selected in the system selector 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.900
 it acts as a differential of 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.000
 limited slip delivering the 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.010
 maximum torque on the wheel that has more 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.750
 adherence another thing is the use that you 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.730
 let's give 2008 out of a 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.110
 Asphalt environment since it does not stop being 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.849
 an urban crossover with traction 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.279
 lead 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.349
 What we may have liked the most are the 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.449
 tires more than the grid control itself 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:45.889
 but he makes a cheap bet with the 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.749
 electronics and supports a 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.879
 tires if we have chosen the 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:52.020
 control grid option very focused on the use 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:54.569
 on land and mud 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.280
 The truth is that although they last less 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.400
 they love us and we miss them in 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.139
 many all 4x4 roads and of course our 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.210
 thirst for information and think of a 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.000
 comparative of this car and a rival 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.009
 equivalent but with 4x4 traction that 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.039
 We hope we can offer you with the pedal to 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:10.039
 background 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.150
 do not
