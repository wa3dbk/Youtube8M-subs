00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
control the axillary 2 RCA's the rear

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
control the axillary 2 RCA's the rear
output<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> amplifier<00:01:44.759> let's<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.689> right

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
output for the amplifier let's see right

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.639 
output for the amplifier let's see right
there<00:01:46.079> yeah<00:01:46.939> it<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> front

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
there yeah it can also be for the front

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.280 
there yeah it can also be for the front
camera<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> car<00:01:50.399> by<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> way<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.630> then

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
camera of the car by the way and then

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.660 
camera of the car by the way and then
the<00:01:52.439> audio<00:01:52.890> input<00:01:54.409> but<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.890> already<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.460> one

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the audio input but you already have one

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
the audio input but you already have one
in<00:01:56.820> here<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.630> don't<00:01:57.750> need<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
in here so you really don't need it it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.789 
in here so you really don't need it it
and<00:01:59.159> then<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.329> also<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> rear<00:02:01.170> output

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and then you also have the rear output

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.149 
and then you also have the rear output
rca's<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:04.200> would<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> front<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
rca's and that would be the front and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.470 
rca's and that would be the front and
rear<00:02:06.979> for<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> fader<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.560> then

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
rear for the fader and then

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.350 
rear for the fader and then
this<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.080> once<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.849> unit<00:02:14.150> once

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
this is once the this is the unit once

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.710 
this is once the this is the unit once
