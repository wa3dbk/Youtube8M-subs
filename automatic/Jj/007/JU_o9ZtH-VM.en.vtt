00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
with this right here I'm gonna create

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.170 
with this right here I'm gonna create
this<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.230> little<00:02:12.890> bit<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.250> shorter<00:02:13.640> textured

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
this a little bit of a shorter textured

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.210 
this a little bit of a shorter textured
look<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.480> through<00:02:14.629> here<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.260> way<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:16.099> you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
look in through here this way if you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.979 
look in through here this way if you
sweep<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:16.610> over<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.330> will<00:02:17.540> come<00:02:17.660> over<00:02:17.780> this

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989
