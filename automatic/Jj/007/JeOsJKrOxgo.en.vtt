 of five in which there will be a 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.900
 match against each one of the group that 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.790
 they will be four matches for each selection 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.440

 to the final that is not in matches 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 and pressures from the teams that touch it 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.009
 each one that has already been done has not been 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.009
