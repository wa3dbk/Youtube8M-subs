00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
was at his heights in WWE the Dudley's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.009 
was at his heights in WWE the Dudley's
were<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> baby-faced<00:02:52.090> tag<00:02:52.390> team<00:02:52.660> they<00:02:52.870> also

really honestly doesn't really fit in
with<00:03:04.750> Debbie<00:03:05.049> Debbie<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:06.010> even<00:03:06.610> if<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.819> have
