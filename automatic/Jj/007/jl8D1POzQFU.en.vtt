pig<00:00:02.659> ears<00:00:02.870> in<00:00:03.139> this<00:00:03.380> video<00:00:03.649> we're<00:00:03.800> going<00:00:03.889> to<00:00:03.949> be

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
pig ears in this video we're going to be

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.829 
pig ears in this video we're going to be
going<00:00:04.130> over<00:00:04.340> molar<00:00:04.670> graveyard<00:00:05.359> which<00:00:05.660> is<00:00:05.810> a

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
going over molar graveyard which is a

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.930 
going over molar graveyard which is a
map<00:00:06.049> on<00:00:06.200> Killzone<00:00:06.740> 3<00:00:06.770> we're<00:00:07.640> going<00:00:07.759> to<00:00:07.819> begin

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
map on Killzone 3 we're going to begin

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.879 
map on Killzone 3 we're going to begin
by<00:00:08.180> looking<00:00:08.360> at<00:00:08.570> the<00:00:08.690> map<00:00:08.870> overview<00:00:09.379> here<00:00:09.410> and

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
by looking at the map overview here and

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.520 
by looking at the map overview here and
you'll<00:00:10.100> be<00:00:10.250> able<00:00:10.340> to<00:00:10.580> see<00:00:10.820> that<00:00:11.270> the<00:00:12.170> map<00:00:12.500> is

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
you'll be able to see that the map is

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.949 
you'll be able to see that the map is
cut<00:00:13.160> into<00:00:13.309> two<00:00:13.610> halves<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.270> in<00:00:14.449> order<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.750> get

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
cut into two halves and in order to get

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.630 
cut into two halves and in order to get
to<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.170> other<00:00:15.320> half<00:00:15.590> you<00:00:15.920> really<00:00:16.279> have<00:00:16.400> to<00:00:16.520> go

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
to the other half you really have to go

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.310 
to the other half you really have to go
through<00:00:16.850> only<00:00:16.940> three<00:00:17.420> different<00:00:17.810> choke<00:00:17.990> point

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
through only three different choke point

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.350 
through only three different choke point
areas<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:19.280> if<00:00:19.430> you<00:00:19.580> can<00:00:19.760> get<00:00:19.910> your<00:00:20.120> team

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
areas so if you can get your team

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.560 
areas so if you can get your team
organized<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.440> create<00:00:22.250> bottlenecks<00:00:22.490> in<00:00:23.120> those

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
organized to create bottlenecks in those

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.500 
organized to create bottlenecks in those
three<00:00:24.020> spots<00:00:24.410> not<00:00:25.130> only<00:00:25.310> is<00:00:25.820> your<00:00:26.030> entire<00:00:26.240> team

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
three spots not only is your entire team

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.270 
three spots not only is your entire team
going<00:00:26.750> to<00:00:26.870> rack<00:00:27.020> up<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.260> kills<00:00:27.530> but<00:00:28.010> you'll<00:00:28.160> be

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
going to rack up the kills but you'll be

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.830 
going to rack up the kills but you'll be
able<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.490> complete<00:00:28.880> your<00:00:28.970> objectives<00:00:29.600> much

can try to push them back to the other
side<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.310> those<00:00:37.550> bottleneck<00:00:38.210> positions<00:00:38.720> it

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.430 
my partner here has gone down and so
with<00:03:32.909> just<00:03:33.209> me<00:03:33.419> there's<00:03:33.840> no<00:03:33.989> way<00:03:34.109> I'm<00:03:34.229> going<00:03:34.349> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
with just me there's no way I'm going to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.469 
with just me there's no way I'm going to
be<00:03:34.500> able<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.709> push<00:03:34.889> through<00:03:35.099> their<00:03:35.310> defenses

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
be able to push through their defenses

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.210 
be able to push through their defenses
so<00:03:36.479> what<00:03:36.840> we've<00:03:37.019> done<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.859> look<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.129> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
so what we've done is if you look on the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.309 
so what we've done is if you look on the
mini-map<00:03:38.489> my<00:03:39.150> teammates<00:03:39.780> are<00:03:39.959> coming<00:03:40.229> from

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
mini-map my teammates are coming from

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.140 
mini-map my teammates are coming from
the<00:03:40.500> opposite<00:03:40.919> side<00:03:41.159> so<00:03:41.579> they're<00:03:41.729> flanking

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
the opposite side so they're flanking

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.699 
the opposite side so they're flanking
from<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.419> left<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:42.900> I'm<00:03:43.260> mostly<00:03:43.590> just

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
from the left and I'm mostly just

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.439 
from the left and I'm mostly just
causing<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.280> distraction<00:03:44.549> here<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.269> right

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
causing a distraction here on the right

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.689 
causing a distraction here on the right
to<00:03:45.599> keep<00:03:45.780> busy<00:03:46.040> you'll<00:03:47.040> notice<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.459> it's

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
to keep busy you'll notice that it's

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.369 
to keep busy you'll notice that it's
going<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.879> work<00:03:48.030> out<00:03:48.209> extremely<00:03:48.780> well<00:03:48.930> we're

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
going to work out extremely well we're

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.140 
going to work out extremely well we're
going<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> collapse<00:03:49.919> here<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.609> enemy<00:03:50.909> and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
going to collapse here on the enemy and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:05.690 
going to collapse here on the enemy and
they<00:03:52.079> really<00:03:52.319> don't<00:03:52.349> have<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> chance

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.100 

so<00:04:06.700> no<00:04:06.819> we're<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.000> defense<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.750> searching

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
so no we're on defense of searching

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.510 
so no we're on defense of searching
destroy<00:04:08.410> here<00:04:08.709> I'm<00:04:08.830> mauler<00:04:09.069> after<00:04:09.430> we

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
destroy here I'm mauler after we

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.960 
destroy here I'm mauler after we
completed<00:04:09.880> our<00:04:10.110> offensive<00:04:11.110> objective<00:04:11.650> and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
completed our offensive objective and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.340 
completed our offensive objective and
the<00:04:12.970> best<00:04:13.209> thing<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.480> defense<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.080> is<00:04:14.230> an

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
the best thing I defense to do is an

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.319 
the best thing I defense to do is an
engineer<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.800> set<00:04:15.130> up<00:04:15.220> your<00:04:15.370> bot<00:04:15.580> set<00:04:16.209> up<00:04:16.299> your

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
engineer to set up your bot set up your

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.150 
engineer to set up your bot set up your
turret<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.019> end<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.440> best<00:04:17.709> place<00:04:18.040> possible

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
turret to end the best place possible

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.210 
turret to end the best place possible
and<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.660> thing<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.019> always<00:04:20.109> say<00:04:20.500> in<00:04:20.829> this

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
and the thing that I always say in this

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.190 
and the thing that I always say in this
video<00:04:21.609> in<00:04:21.790> in<00:04:21.910> my<00:04:22.000> previous<00:04:22.360> videos<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:23.080> that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
video in in my previous videos is that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.110 
video in in my previous videos is that
you<00:04:23.320> really<00:04:23.620> need<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.770> watch<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.520> back<00:04:24.760> or<00:04:25.090> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you really need to watch the back or the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.510 
you really need to watch the back or the
flanks<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.720> your<00:04:25.930> BOTS<00:04:26.139> little<00:04:27.010> less<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.190> lot

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.620 
flanks of your BOTS little less a lot
longer<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:27.970> they're<00:04:28.120> going<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.270> be<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.389> lot

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
longer and they're going to be a lot

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.629 
longer and they're going to be a lot
more<00:04:28.660> efficient<00:04:29.380> if<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.650> can<00:04:29.860> hold<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.370> sides

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
more efficient if you can hold the sides

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:52.620 
more efficient if you can hold the sides

good spot so you can defend it by
yourself<00:05:43.979> just<00:05:44.979> remember<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.400> it<00:05:45.520> really

yourself just remember that it really

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.399 
yourself just remember that it really
doesn't<00:05:46.029> matter<00:05:46.150> how<00:05:46.449> good<00:05:46.689> or<00:05:46.750> poor<00:05:47.139> your
