00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
back this is a handmade sample so it's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.160 
back this is a handmade sample so it's
still<00:00:16.460> very<00:00:16.580> delicate<00:00:17.119> I'll<00:00:17.750> pull<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.020> back

so<00:00:23.330> you<00:00:23.420> can<00:00:23.540> see<00:00:23.660> how<00:00:23.690> it<00:00:23.810> camps<00:00:24.230> all<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.470> way

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
so you can see how it camps all the way

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.240 
so you can see how it camps all the way
out<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:24.980> then<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.640> foot<00:00:25.900> there's<00:00:26.900> a<00:00:27.010> lever<00:00:28.010> on

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
out and then the foot there's a lever on

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.670 
out and then the foot there's a lever on
the<00:00:28.279> side<00:00:28.430> that<00:00:28.640> allows<00:00:29.119> me<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:29.450> take<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.410> foot

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
the side that allows me to take the foot

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.760 
the side that allows me to take the foot
I<00:00:30.920> can<00:00:31.189> adjust<00:00:31.490> it<00:00:31.670> in<00:00:31.880> all<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.689> way<00:00:32.809> in<00:00:33.080> all

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
I can adjust it in all the way in all

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.799 
I can adjust it in all the way in all
the<00:00:33.830> way<00:00:34.010> out<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.489> can<00:00:35.270> pull<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.540> all<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.690> way

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
the way out I can pull it all the way

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.260 
the way out I can pull it all the way
off<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.320> I<00:00:36.739> could<00:00:36.800> replace<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.520> with<00:00:38.120> an

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
off and I could replace it with an

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
off and I could replace it with an
alternative<00:00:38.870> as<00:00:39.650> well

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.710 

and<00:00:45.290> then<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.860> same<00:00:46.130> piece<00:00:46.880> is<00:00:47.210> then<00:00:47.360> i<00:00:47.540> have

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
and then the same piece is then i have

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.690 
and then the same piece is then i have
the<00:00:47.870> weights<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.710> will<00:00:48.860> pop<00:00:49.070> off<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.520> i

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
the weights so this will pop off and i

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.400 
the weights so this will pop off and i
can<00:00:49.879> adjust<00:00:50.180> my<00:00:50.239> 30<00:00:50.570> grams<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.020> weights<00:00:51.199> as

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
can adjust my 30 grams and weights as

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.860 
can adjust my 30 grams and weights as
well<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.120> can<00:00:53.270> see<00:00:53.390> how<00:00:53.540> this<00:00:53.690> is

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
well and you can see how this is

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.420 
well and you can see how this is
actually<00:00:54.260> grew<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:54.890> can<00:00:55.040> see<00:00:55.160> how<00:00:55.309> this

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
actually grew so you can see how this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.610 
actually grew so you can see how this
was<00:00:55.640> slide<00:00:55.910> forward<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.540> back<00:00:57.020> based<00:00:57.320> on<00:00:57.500> that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
was slide forward and back based on that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.610 
was slide forward and back based on that
individual<00:00:58.160> group<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.269> all<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.140> buttons<00:01:00.440> are

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
individual group so all the buttons are

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.340 
individual group so all the buttons are
programmable<00:01:01.690> everything<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.780> adjustable

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
programmable everything is adjustable

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.060 
programmable everything is adjustable
and<00:01:04.600> it'll<00:01:05.600> ship<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.290> marks<00:01:06.619> time<00:01:06.800> frame

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
and it'll ship in the marks time frame

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.890 
and it'll ship in the marks time frame
so<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.030> not<00:01:08.150> shipping<00:01:08.450> right<00:01:08.720> now

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
so it this is not shipping right now

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.020 
so it this is not shipping right now
this<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.320> early<00:01:10.190> early<00:01:10.520> pre-production

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
this is a early early pre-production

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.910 
this is a early early pre-production

wireless version to give the USB cable

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.340 
wireless version to give the USB cable
and<00:03:15.700> what<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.840> I'll<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:17.080> showing

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
and what this is and I'll just showing

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.780 
and what this is and I'll just showing
where<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.590> goes<00:03:17.740> on<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.280> wireless<00:03:18.550> version

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
where it goes on the wireless version

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.190 
where it goes on the wireless version
there's<00:03:19.120> actually<00:03:19.390> connectors<00:03:19.900> from<00:03:19.990> this

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
there's actually connectors from this

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.900 
there's actually connectors from this
slide<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.980> what<00:03:21.130> will<00:03:21.220> happen<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.610> we<00:03:21.760> give

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
slide and what will happen is we give

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.640 
slide and what will happen is we give
you<00:03:22.000> two<00:03:22.209> words<00:03:22.390> article<00:03:22.780> batteries<00:03:23.170> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
you two words article batteries and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.710 
you two words article batteries and
they'll<00:03:23.770> just<00:03:23.800> slot<00:03:24.220> into<00:03:24.459> here<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.940> what<00:03:25.630> it

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
they'll just slot into here and what it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.440 
they'll just slot into here and what it
allows<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.200> do<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.709> when<00:03:26.920> one<00:03:27.160> is

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
allows you to do that is when one is

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.449 
allows you to do that is when one is
being<00:03:28.450> used<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.530> other<00:03:29.709> ones<00:03:29.890> projects<00:03:30.340> for

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
being used the other ones projects for

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.680 
being used the other ones projects for
the<00:03:30.490> deposit<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.300> serves<00:03:31.480> as<00:03:31.630> a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
the deposit and this serves as a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.900 
the deposit and this serves as a
receiver

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
receiver

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.520 
receiver
and<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.510> rather<00:03:33.630> than<00:03:33.780> having<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.050> plug<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
and so rather than having to plug in the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.190 
and so rather than having to plug in the
mouse<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.710> turn<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.310> put<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.480> dock<00:03:36.750> just

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
mouse and turn to put it on a dock just

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.740 
mouse and turn to put it on a dock just
swapping<00:03:37.500> it
