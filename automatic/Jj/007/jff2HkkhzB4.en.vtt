00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
tubing going up over head I'll show you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.610 
tubing going up over head I'll show you
here<00:02:37.549> in<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> minute<00:02:37.850> what<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.120> did<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.869 
see here I put in the new faucet
and<00:02:46.370> hot<00:02:47.120> water<00:02:47.299> cold<00:02:48.019> water<00:02:48.579> also<00:02:49.579> added

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
and hot water cold water also added

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.300 
and hot water cold water also added
something<00:02:50.090> else<00:02:50.980> because<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.129> original

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
something else because the original

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580 
something else because the original
files<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.909> had<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.299> pullout<00:02:53.959> diverter<00:02:54.319> on

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
files have had the pullout diverter on

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.690 
files have had the pullout diverter on
it<00:02:54.969> and<00:02:55.969> you<00:02:56.569> can't<00:02:56.810> buy<00:02:56.959> them<00:02:57.140> locally<00:02:57.590> at<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
it and you can't buy them locally at the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.170 
it and you can't buy them locally at the
hardware<00:02:59.239> store<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> decided<00:03:01.129> I'll<00:03:01.969> put

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
hardware store so I decided I'll put

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.629 
hardware store so I decided I'll put
this<00:03:02.329> in<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:03.620> was<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.609> easy<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.000> job<00:03:06.639> I

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
this in it was not that easy but job I

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.080 
this in it was not that easy but job I
did<00:03:08.480> have<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.810> pull<00:03:09.019> out<00:03:09.489> everything<00:03:10.489> back<00:03:10.849> in

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
did have to pull out everything back in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.270 
did have to pull out everything back in
here<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:11.959> pulled<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.349> medicine<00:03:12.920> cabinet

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
out actually

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.119 
out actually
so<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.810> was<00:03:14.900> held<00:03:15.109> in<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.349> six<00:03:15.560> screws<00:03:15.799> tied

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
so it was held in with six screws tied

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.319 
so it was held in with six screws tied
into<00:03:16.310> these<00:03:16.489> wooden<00:03:16.760> blocks

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329

goes<00:03:26.510> up<00:03:26.689> to<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.840> showerhead<00:03:27.409> and<00:03:29.230> well<00:03:30.230> when

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
goes up to the showerhead and well when
