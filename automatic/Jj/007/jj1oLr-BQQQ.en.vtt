00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:25.390
 the agent and the glass is coming and the manuel 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:31.359
 and I saw a world assessment 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.890
 I think I made it here to bring it to you. 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.970
 the escalation of the Brazilian team joseph 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 daniel 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.860
 thiago davi state and Marcelo can 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.890
 oscar or fred and neymar 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:54.839
 What draws the attention that you are 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:01:00.339
 seeing here oh difference bug signals 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:05.440
 two circles we are 11 is not dash for 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:07.360
 daniel paulinho and seek to put the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.420
 ia is also this twelfth player 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.180
 that we do not know if it's going to be the 11th 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:21.039
 so they are also observing the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:24.869
 Fred sees why this is very private and 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:29.520
 there we would have what we would be 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.520
 we want a player who unbalances 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.450
 we have two great players 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:42.429
 individual technique that is marcelo is the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:46.899
 ellipse is we will be a player of 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.630
 great defensive technique that is the devil 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.200
 we have four good players 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.969
 technique that is daniel paulinho oscar e 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.020
 david luiz the two players strength and 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.310
 marking 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.689
 hulk is luis gustavo and we will have one 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.980
 finisher that is a building understand that 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.319
 the champion will add the factors factor 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.069
 psychology for children with the technical actor 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.549
 tactical quattor and has issued all these 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.230
 factors 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:28.299
 I made an individual prayer to see 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.799
 as is our selection also liked 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.890
 the joke 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.409
 for example the Argentinean analysis with 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.650
 these items I put here from 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:53.159
 optimum individual technical imbalance 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:56.590
 There's great defensive technique and that's it. 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:00.489
 analysis within these points was the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.209
 who is the strongest who is a road 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.099
 he already with the selection with the selection 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.099
 Brazilian 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.299
 Your team is not even there. 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.189
 Then I know it's different, right? 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.730
 You have to put some items like that. 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.730
 in the selection we do not have much bad 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.819
 the kind of items so put in your 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.610
 team but who is making your team 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.549
 also make this joke look also 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.620
 you may even find an imbalance 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.829
 you may find that he has a great 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.930
 that is a good player but can 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.719
 find the one that does not fit 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.269
 then the one that bad player of more or 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:50.560
 less nice 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:56.739
 I put in relation to the selection the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:03.359
 Brazilian selection is this is the analysis 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:08.069
 What am I doing with the Brazilian team today? 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:12.510
 we are strong we have conditions of 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.510
 go all to the victory happen 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.620
 in a certain person or the teacher to god 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.960
 now who will be to play the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.960
 end of world cup 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.980
 I do not want to see in the othon. 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.930
 So, this is a joke. 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.620
 It's still a joke, but it's 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.200
 a nothing to heal easy and you believe a lot 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.350
 interesting about the Brazilian team 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:58.700
 in World Cup Brazil will have reached the 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.700
 to use
