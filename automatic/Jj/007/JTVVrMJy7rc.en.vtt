00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.800
 a lot of lighting has been around for a long time 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.050
 it used to be a desk option on the more luxurious cars 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.580
 but nowadays there are also six to buy twice that you can do yourself 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.369
 to build in 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.969
 does that mean that you can do this randomly just like anybody else? 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.380
 replaced by such a small country no not so but there are some 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.109
 vacant 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.390
 if your car hit the road after January 2007 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.470
 then he must see his wood oven as an extreme with a boxing england 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.539
 of an automatic level control 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.250
 which ensures that if you stay over a speed bump for example

 headlight 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.400
 go back on time so that you are not blinded 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.570
 and even the headlight must be equipped with a wash installation 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 He already points the headlight off the road 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.570
 fear of failure or that causes disturbance of the light which makes you faster them 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 are blind 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.160
 with xenon lighting 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.260
 then when a handy purchasing plan becomes a woman 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 m what rules are there with regard to xenon lighting 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.910
 the young women's country is being built 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.040
 must be suitable for xenon lighting 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.970
 each one has headlight units that has codes and for 2 0 lighting that is the letter 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.530
 b 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.620
 no lights at Halle, for example, there is a shark in front of them 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.810
 to prevent you from having the wrong country then 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.979
 drive in the wrong unit and thereby blind the trade at times 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.690
 that a headlight units 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 is designed for half past one lighting 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.020
 the mirror and the glass are adjusted accordingly 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.880
 as soon as you start fitting another country 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.439
 then the coordination is no longer good and the chances are very high that you will be oncoming traffic 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.890
 connect the other road users 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 but we can also get a ticket for it 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.549

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.850
 that the police from and about 2009 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.300

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.570
 If I have long been in the wrong headlight you will not see 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.979
 the police only fine if there is blinding lighting 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 the causes and age of the car 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.900
 and this ticket costs 90 euros 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.650

 of that switch installation and that automatic level control 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.890
 but that does not mean that you can blind the traffic so you stay too 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.289
 have to do with that 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.209
 general rule to forgive indoor lighting 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.609
 but they have to make sure it was like a ball 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.180
 that they are light well adjust but they could not be the headlights 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.639
 who give up when the schools are happy to have the sing off meeting 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.829
 Then the blinding country is in some countries as home to the roof
