00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
that is actually the mark thee in my

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.130 
that is actually the mark thee in my
opinion<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.010> looks<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.880> Mark<00:02:37.120> V<00:02:37.420> or

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
opinion it looks like the Mark V or

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.580 
opinion it looks like the Mark V or
maybe<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.890> could<00:02:39.099> be<00:02:39.130> something<00:02:39.760> else<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.590> 53

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
maybe it could be something else that 53

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.830 
maybe it could be something else that 53

so the next creation I'll be talking
about<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.730> on<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.990> fuel<00:04:46.230> rod<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.650> fuel<00:04:46.950> rod<00:04:47.130> is

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
talked about the fuel rod being back in

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.610

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
mean I don't know if this myself

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.450 
mean I don't know if this myself
doesn't<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.450> home<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.870> look<00:05:19.080> like<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.530> elite

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460

Ranger<00:05:20.789> helmet<00:05:21.680> from<00:05:22.680> here<00:05:22.890> which<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.400> mean<00:05:23.580> if

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
Ranger helmet from here which I mean if

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.190 
Ranger helmet from here which I mean if
you<00:05:23.850> take<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.090> close<00:05:24.479> look<00:05:24.600> at<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.169> looks

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
you take a close look at it it looks

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.670 
you take a close look at it it looks
sort<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.250> like<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:27.600> lead<00:05:27.780> Ranger<00:05:28.229> helmets

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
sort of like the lead Ranger helmets

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.670 
sort of like the lead Ranger helmets
from<00:05:28.919> he'll<00:05:29.250> reach<00:05:30.020> maybe<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.320> could<00:05:31.530> be

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
from he'll reach maybe this could be

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.100 
from he'll reach maybe this could be
just<00:05:31.890> because<00:05:32.100> we're<00:05:32.669> looking<00:05:32.970> at<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.720> person

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
just because we're looking at the person

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.000 
just because we're looking at the person
like<00:05:34.289> from<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.310> back<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:36.090> or<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.560> could<00:05:37.770> be

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
like from the back and or it could be

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.640 
like from the back and or it could be
that<00:05:38.340> they've<00:05:39.180> got<00:05:39.479> a<00:05:39.510> new<00:05:39.780> helmet<00:05:40.200> that<00:05:40.380> looks

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.990 
also confirmed that it's actually pretty
powerful<00:06:03.780> so<00:06:04.650> for<00:06:04.860> those<00:06:05.010> you<00:06:05.340> know<00:06:05.490> badasses

powerful so for those you know badasses

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.820 
powerful so for those you know badasses
would<00:06:06.330> like<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.660> kill<00:06:06.870> people<00:06:06.900> with<00:06:07.260> plasma

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
would like to kill people with plasma

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.520

pistols<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.669> know<00:06:08.760> I<00:06:08.940> do<00:06:09.090> it<00:06:09.240> myself<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:09.990> it's

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
pistols I know I do it myself and it's

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.170 
pistols I know I do it myself and it's
actually<00:06:10.860> pretty<00:06:11.070> cool<00:06:11.250> so<00:06:11.760> that<00:06:11.940> will<00:06:12.060> be

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
actually pretty cool so that will be

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.450 
actually pretty cool so that will be
back<00:06:12.419> but<00:06:12.659> it<00:06:12.870> would<00:06:12.990> be<00:06:13.080> even<00:06:13.340> stronger<00:06:14.340> than

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
back but it would be even stronger than

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.080 
back but it would be even stronger than
before

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
before

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.060 
before
and<00:06:15.389> last<00:06:16.260> point<00:06:16.380> I'll<00:06:16.680> be<00:06:16.770> talking<00:06:16.919> about

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
and last point I'll be talking about

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.610 
and last point I'll be talking about
today<00:06:17.400> is<00:06:17.520> on<00:06:17.850> the<00:06:18.210> storm<00:06:18.660> rifle<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.200> storm

today is on the storm rifle and storm
rifle<00:06:19.800> is<00:06:20.250> or<00:06:21.120> should<00:06:21.690> be<00:06:21.770> replacing<00:06:22.910> the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
rifle is or should be replacing the

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.060 
rifle is or should be replacing the
plasma<00:06:24.270> repeater<00:06:24.600> from<00:06:24.930> Hill<00:06:25.200> which<00:06:25.470> if<00:06:25.860> you

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
plasma repeater from Hill which if you

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.340 
plasma repeater from Hill which if you
can<00:06:26.370> remember<00:06:27.180> from<00:06:27.330> back<00:06:27.690> then<00:06:27.990> in<00:06:28.169> he'll

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
can remember from back then in he'll

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.280 
can remember from back then in he'll
reach<00:06:28.620> about<00:06:28.950> two<00:06:29.190> years<00:06:29.370> ago<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:30.930> plasma

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
reach about two years ago the plasma

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.530 
reach about two years ago the plasma
repeater<00:06:31.620> was<00:06:31.980> the<00:06:32.370> sort<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.700> assault<00:06:33.060> rifle

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
repeater was the sort of assault rifle

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.500 
repeater was the sort of assault rifle
fault<00:06:33.780> covenant<00:06:34.350> and<00:06:34.970> it<00:06:35.970> was<00:06:36.120> one<00:06:36.300> of<00:06:36.330> the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
fault covenant and it was one of the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.920 
fault covenant and it was one of the
primary<00:06:36.780> weapons<00:06:37.260> for<00:06:37.440> them<00:06:37.650> and<00:06:37.970> it<00:06:38.970> is<00:06:39.180> you

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
primary weapons for them and it is you

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.379 
primary weapons for them and it is you
know<00:06:40.020> I<00:06:40.050> think<00:06:40.200> it's<00:06:40.530> a<00:06:40.760> replacement<00:06:41.760> for<00:06:42.210> it

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
know I think it's a replacement for it

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.170 
know I think it's a replacement for it
so<00:06:42.660> that<00:06:43.530> was<00:06:43.650> it<00:06:43.800> for<00:06:43.950> today<00:06:44.250> guys<00:06:44.460> that<00:06:44.970> was
