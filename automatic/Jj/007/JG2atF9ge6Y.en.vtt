00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 unplugged the film one of this films 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.500
 week outgoing Thursday, January 23rd is 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.259
 walking with the nilla dinosaurs 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.809
 nightingale and barry cook and he talks about it 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 our dearest sent from Rome that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 he has already seen it for us a fearful marina 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 marina hello welcome back hello deborah hello 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 to all 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 well back then a movie I have here 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.740
 read animated film but you first me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 you said it's not really animation 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 explain to me what it is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 then in practice it is not of animation 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 because as participating in real e 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.120
 own actors in the framework from which it starts 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.100
 just the story the plot and come back 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 then in the end it's all the rest of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.039
 history is realized in computer graphics 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
 but absolutely not a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.850
 animation film 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 there are however the landscapes taken are 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.160
 were actually taken right i 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 ugly dinosaurs I remember a bit ceva 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 words to take them was a little 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.030
 problematic it's all in the right 3D and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 all in 3d and I must say that the right use 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 and yesterday was really it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.659
 appropriate because it is not the first film 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.670
 in which we talk about dinosaurs climates the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 first of all jurassic park or even al 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.479
 his animated film found it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.150
 purchased add the 3d which is then 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.759
 been very well done and give the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.759
 same time to the film together with a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.920
 a fairy tale aspect as well as a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.290
 documentary aspect indeed man 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.700
 the hand they were presented appeared 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 new characters new species of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.290
 dinosaurs explained they appeared 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 written the voice explained vanoni meats 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.259
 hours the name from which it derives from what derives 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.390
 what does the name really so 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.570
 a satisfactory product by way of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.399
 between a fiction film is a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 documentary that tells us a little like 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.450
 a dromedary the dinosaurs but yes the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 story below what the estimate is anyway 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.190
 tells the story of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.920
 of peace a baby of saurian fakirism 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.500
 in its growth phase until 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 it does not become a pack leader as it is 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.870
 his father was told 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.390
 migrations are told told 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.850
 the difficulties in meeting others 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.470
 and dinosaur species also comes 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.550
 told in the story inside 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.680
 of history the falling in love with del 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.350
 a very pretty thing starring 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.420
 enjoyable and at the same time one can 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.410
 see just how they spend a 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.330
 whole year the dinosaurs and how it comes 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.850
 established who the pack leader is 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.850
 what are the various roles within the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.360
 same very instructive flock also i 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.580
 children 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.709
 I think they will love it so you think it is 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.319
 one of the films still suitable for children 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.790
 which I think you will be 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.590
 agree with me we think a little 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.900
 the same way there are very few 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.890
 of movies really for kids lately 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.000
 it ultimately is this really 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.440
 recommended also like the great e 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.780
 also like the big ones 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.110
 I also like the large because I love it 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.970
 however it is a pleasure to see the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.040
 beauty of the image as well as following 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.690
 the narrative there are 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.150
 shots of the long fields 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.640
 wonderful even for the little ones 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.480
 details of the missini dinosaurs 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.489
 plans that something of their own that attracts 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.110
 like a magnet 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.120
 well well so this is worth it 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.070
 see it in 3d because even on 3d I have 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.209
 some doubts I'm not going to see all the 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.090
 3D movies because most 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.010
 I think they are good too 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.560
 Two-dimensional 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.269
 but in this case he was there 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.120
 fantastic then to walk with i 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.670
 neal nightingale and barry dinosaurs 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.959
 cook with john leguizamo i see by the way 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.430
