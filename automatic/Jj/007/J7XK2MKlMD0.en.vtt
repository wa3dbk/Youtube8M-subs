00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
my domain circuit is easier to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.640 
my domain circuit is easier to
to<00:02:11.890> close<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.280> hole<00:02:12.490> my<00:02:13.030> friend<00:02:13.360> went<00:02:14.230> one

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650

hopefully we'll be able to get him to do

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.440 
hopefully we'll be able to get him to do
a<00:02:42.040> detailed<00:02:42.430> explanation<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:43.120> how<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.300> do

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
a detailed explanation of how you do

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.220 
a detailed explanation of how you do
that<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.720> maybe<00:02:44.650> even<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.989> one<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.110> my

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
that and maybe even do it to one of my

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.949 
that and maybe even do it to one of my
baby<00:02:47.530> bags<00:02:47.800> my<00:02:48.760> common<00:02:49.030> thinking<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.540> perhaps

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
baby bags my common thinking as perhaps

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.110 
baby bags my common thinking as perhaps
I<00:02:50.170> would<00:02:50.320> like<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.620> do<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.400> smaller<00:02:51.790> out

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I would like to do on the smaller out

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.280 
I would like to do on the smaller out
cut<00:02:52.390> bike<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:54.070> reason<00:02:54.970> being<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
cut bike and reason being is that the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.660 
cut bike and reason being is that the
draw<00:02:56.500> cord<00:02:56.800> wall<00:02:57.209> will<00:02:58.209> tighten<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.690> hood<00:02:58.840> up

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
draw cord wall will tighten the hood up

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.210 
draw cord wall will tighten the hood up
because<00:03:00.670> I'll<00:03:00.850> K<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.209> quite<00:03:01.420> small<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:02.220> would

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
because I'll K it's quite small I would

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.860 
because I'll K it's quite small I would
like<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.520> egg<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:04.060> material<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.600> having

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
like that egg to material and having

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.860 
like that egg to material and having
this<00:03:05.080> up<00:03:05.230> there<00:03:05.440> with<00:03:05.800> me<00:03:05.950> net<00:03:06.190> I'm<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:06.970> taking

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
this up there with me net I'm not taking

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.479 
this up there with me net I'm not taking
in<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.050> OP<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.530> there's<00:03:09.160> something<00:03:09.310> I'll

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
in the OP so there's something I'll

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.490 
in the OP so there's something I'll
think<00:03:09.670> about<00:03:09.910> that's<00:03:10.150> my<00:03:10.360> setup<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.080> bike<00:03:11.320> was

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
think about that's my setup so bike was

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.539 
think about that's my setup so bike was
protect<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.040> my<00:03:12.100> head<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.980> what<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.160> don't

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
protect on my head and what on don't

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.539 
protect on my head and what on don't
never<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.299> so<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.959> think<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:18.220> relatively

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
never I know so I think it's relatively

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.640 
never I know so I think it's relatively
quiet<00:03:18.910> here<00:03:19.180> sort<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.480> pasture<00:03:19.840> over<00:03:19.870> to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
quiet here sort of pasture over to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:35.400 
quiet here sort of pasture over to
myself<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:34.120> that's<00:03:34.299> us<00:03:34.570> most<00:03:35.110> of<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.290> read

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
myself so that's us most of the read

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.009 
myself so that's us most of the read
though<00:03:35.530> now<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:36.700> can't<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.420> there<00:03:37.780> somewhere

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
though now you can't up there somewhere

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.490 
though now you can't up there somewhere
last<00:03:38.380> name<00:03:39.329> Kim<00:03:40.329> down<00:03:40.570> through<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.989> gully

last name Kim down through the gully
there<00:03:41.670> route<00:03:42.670> goes<00:03:42.850> up<00:03:43.000> through<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.209> gully

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
there route goes up through the gully

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.440 
there route goes up through the gully
over<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.840> top<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.440> continues<00:03:45.340> up<00:03:45.489> good<00:03:46.239> night
