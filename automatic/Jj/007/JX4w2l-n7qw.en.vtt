00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
joke I know we've been talking for a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
joke I know we've been talking for a
while<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.229> having<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.590> prostitute

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
while about you know having a prostitute

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.390 
while about you know having a prostitute
as<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.360> guest<00:01:25.320> host<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> show<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800 
as a as a guest host on the show and I
still<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.850> that'd<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.299> no<00:01:27.479> idea<00:01:27.570> but

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
still think that'd be really no idea but

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.550 
still think that'd be really no idea but
we<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.049> managed<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.400> um<00:01:29.720> not<00:01:30.720> she's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we have managed to get but um not she's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.069 
we have managed to get but um not she's
not<00:01:31.740> hardened<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.729> internet<00:01:33.479> jackasses<00:01:34.049> like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
not hardened to internet jackasses like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.420 
not hardened to internet jackasses like
like<00:01:34.470> somebody<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> YouTube<00:01:35.400> channel

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
like somebody with a YouTube channel

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.390 
like somebody with a YouTube channel

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
after the podcast stop I thought I had

talks<00:02:03.840> about<00:02:04.229> cats<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.159> think<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.610> pretty

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
talks about cats and think it's pretty

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.960 
talks about cats and think it's pretty
funny<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.560> afterwards<00:02:08.369> when<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> realized<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
funny so afterwards when I realized that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
funny so afterwards when I realized that
I<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.410> point<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.800 
really big they were two hundred and
fifty<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> hundred<00:02:48.030> 30<00:02:48.420> megabytes

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
fifty and a hundred 30 megabytes

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.510 
fifty and a hundred 30 megabytes
respectively<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> we

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
respectively and because of that we

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.580 
respectively and because of that we
didn't<00:02:50.850> have<00:02:50.880> space<00:02:51.240> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> hard<00:02:51.660> drive<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
didn't have space on the hard drive to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160 
didn't have space on the hard drive to
hold<00:02:52.800> all<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> new<00:02:53.280> ones<00:02:53.690> we<00:02:54.690> only<00:02:54.810> get<00:02:54.990> so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
hold all the new ones we only get so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.000 
hold all the new ones we only get so
much<00:02:55.290> space<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.620> host<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.190> podcast<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
much space to host the podcast and the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.530 
much space to host the podcast and the
podcasts<00:02:59.460> are<00:02:59.550> about<00:02:59.670> 20<00:03:00.030> megs<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.390> think

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
podcasts are about 20 megs so I think

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660 
podcasts are about 20 megs so I think
that<00:03:00.870> at<00:03:01.680> any<00:03:01.770> given<00:03:02.100> time<00:03:02.250> we'll<00:03:02.460> probably

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
that at any given time we'll probably

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
that at any given time we'll probably
have<00:03:02.940> about<00:03:03.030> 15<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.080> most<00:03:04.260> current

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
have about 15 of the most current

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.480 
have about 15 of the most current
advanced<00:03:05.100> up<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:06.740> episodes<00:03:07.740> one<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.010> two

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490

hacked<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.500> when<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:25.980> write<00:04:26.190> computer

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
hacked so when you write computer

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.310 
hacked so when you write computer
programs<00:04:26.700> usually<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.930> don't<00:04:28.050> write<00:04:28.290> it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
programs usually you don't write it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.960 
programs usually you don't write it
completely<00:04:29.010> from<00:04:29.160> start<00:04:29.550> there's<00:04:29.850> a

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
completely from start there's a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.330 
completely from start there's a
libraries<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.020> can<00:04:31.200> reuse<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:32.010> solve

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
libraries that you can reuse that solve

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.300 
libraries that you can reuse that solve
common<00:04:32.640> problems<00:04:32.790> then<00:04:33.510> in<00:04:33.630> my<00:04:33.750> case<00:04:34.310> there

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
common problems then in my case there

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.550 
common problems then in my case there
was<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.460> little<00:04:36.000> JavaScript<00:04:36.510> routine<00:04:37.200> which

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
was a little JavaScript routine which

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.590 
was a little JavaScript routine which
could<00:04:38.100> read<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.490> write<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.060> delete<00:04:39.330> from<00:04:39.450> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
could read and write and delete from the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.430 
could read and write and delete from the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
database that that while I disabled it

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.080 
database that that while I disabled it
in<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.680> UI<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.400> was<00:04:44.550> still<00:04:44.790> there<00:04:44.910> in<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
in the UI it was still there in the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.630 
in the UI it was still there in the
library<00:04:45.860> there's<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.920> security<00:04:47.520> vulnerability

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
library there's a security vulnerability

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.060 
library there's a security vulnerability
in<00:04:48.300> code<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.870> reuse<00:04:49.320> that<00:04:49.500> stuff<00:04:49.740> I<00:04:49.830> wrote

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
in code that I reuse that stuff I wrote

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.310 
in code that I reuse that stuff I wrote
but<00:04:50.400> stuff<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.510> someone<00:04:51.780> else<00:04:51.870> had<00:04:52.140> been

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
but stuff that someone else had been

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.790 
but stuff that someone else had been
written<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.450> so<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.480> fixed<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.170> you<00:04:55.710> know

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
written and so I fixed that and you know

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.620 
written and so I fixed that and you know
that<00:04:55.860> vulnerability<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.670> plugged<00:04:56.940> hopefully

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
that vulnerability is plugged hopefully

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.250 
that vulnerability is plugged hopefully
