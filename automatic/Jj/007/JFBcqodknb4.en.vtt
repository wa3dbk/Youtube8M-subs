00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
called bump and run so you always want

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
called bump and run so you always want
to<00:01:58.020> strike<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.860> opposite<00:01:59.280> hand<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> if

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
to strike with your opposite hand so if

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
to strike with your opposite hand so if
he<00:02:00.780> goes<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:02.009> should<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.250> striking

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
he goes right you should be striking

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
he goes right you should be striking
with<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.119> left<00:02:03.360> trying<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> keep<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.469> hips

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
with your left trying to keep your hips

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
with your left trying to keep your hips
close<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.189> long<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.549> possible<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.180> we're<00:02:06.750> going

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
close as long as possible so we're going

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.360 
close as long as possible so we're going
to<00:02:06.930> keep<00:02:07.079> going<00:02:08.360> keep<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.009> if<00:02:11.009> he<00:02:11.129> tries

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to keep going keep going and if he tries

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.250 
to keep going keep going and if he tries
to<00:02:11.400> make<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> move<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> opposite<00:02:12.480> side<00:02:12.720> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
to make a move to the opposite side you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.640 
to make a move to the opposite side you
open

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
open

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.759 
open
you<00:02:14.459> strike<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.970> other<00:02:15.120> side<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> we're

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
you strike with the other side so we're

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.430 
you strike with the other side so we're
going<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> start<00:02:17.099> back<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> beginning

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
going to start back to the beginning

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.270 
going to start back to the beginning
we're<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> go<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:20.129> slight<00:02:21.030> jog<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.569> time

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
we're going to go a slight jog this time

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
we're going to go a slight jog this time
same<00:02:23.280> his<00:02:24.180> inside<00:02:24.629> foot<00:02:24.930> should<00:02:25.319> be<00:02:25.379> your

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
same his inside foot should be your

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.280 
same his inside foot should be your
inside<00:02:25.980> foot<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.849> that's<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.569> way<00:02:27.720> your

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
inside foot and that's the way your

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.289 
inside foot and that's the way your
separation<00:02:28.950> should<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.370> yard<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> half<00:02:30.090> two

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
separation should be yard and a half two

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.920 
separation should be yard and a half two
yards<00:02:30.629> off<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.709> his<00:02:31.830> next<00:02:32.160> movement<00:02:32.780> say<00:02:33.780> he

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
yards off so his next movement say he

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.440 
yards off so his next movement say he
steps<00:02:34.200> inside<00:02:34.379> again<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.970> should<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.180> coming

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
steps inside again you should be coming

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.949 
steps inside again you should be coming
this<00:02:36.540> way

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
this way

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.449 
this way
the<00:02:37.170> closer<00:02:37.440> he<00:02:37.620> gets<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.069> don't<00:02:38.220> want<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
the closer he gets you don't want to

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.250 
the closer he gets you don't want to
reach<00:02:38.610> out<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.000> strike<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.810> want<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.049> let<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
reach out and strike you want to let the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.380 
reach out and strike you want to let the
receiver<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.489> that's<00:02:42.120> when<00:02:42.299> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
receiver get to you and that's when you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.770 
receiver get to you and that's when you
strike<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.379> he<00:02:43.470> closes<00:02:43.680> another<00:02:44.129> step<00:02:44.780> then

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
strike so if he closes another step then

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.229 
strike so if he closes another step then
he's<00:02:45.900> coming<00:02:46.170> into<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.880> create

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
he's coming into you then you create

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.360 
he's coming into you then you create
that<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:49.049> another<00:02:49.349> separation<00:02:49.829> by

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that with another separation by

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
that with another separation by
extending<00:02:50.760> your<00:02:50.849> arm<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.260> get<00:02:52.410> that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
extending your arm and you get that

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.339 
extending your arm and you get that
separation<00:02:53.010> back<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:54.599> if<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.870> cuts<00:02:55.079> back<00:02:55.260> to

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
separation back so if you cuts back to

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.559 
separation back so if you cuts back to
the<00:02:55.440> opposite<00:02:55.739> side<00:02:56.060> then<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.209> that

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the opposite side then you have that

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.020 
the opposite side then you have that
separation<00:02:58.110> again<00:02:58.379> by<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.099> time<00:02:59.489> he's<00:02:59.790> about

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
separation again by this time he's about

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.420 
separation again by this time he's about
five<00:03:00.390> four<00:03:01.170> or<00:03:01.230> five<00:03:01.410> yards<00:03:01.560> upfield<00:03:02.069> it's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
five four or five yards upfield it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.430 
five four or five yards upfield it's
going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.700> cause<00:03:02.879> you<00:03:03.150> most<00:03:03.750> likely<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.170> open

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
going to cause you most likely to open

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.500 
going to cause you most likely to open
up<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.680> hips<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.160> run<00:03:05.579> with<00:03:05.760> them<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.299> see

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
up your hips and run with them so I see

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.630 
up your hips and run with them so I see
gets<00:03:06.720> down<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> field<00:03:07.230> keep<00:03:07.530> going<00:03:07.799> then

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
gets down the field keep going then

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.890 
gets down the field keep going then
you're<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.000> position<00:03:09.180> hopefully

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
you're in this position hopefully

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.520 
you're in this position hopefully
staying<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.319> top<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:12.540> creation<00:03:13.319> your

turn<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.829> run<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.549> you're<00:03:14.730> out<00:03:14.849> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> bump

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
turn to run and you're out of the bump

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.890 
turn to run and you're out of the bump
and<00:03:15.390> run<00:03:15.480> phase<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:17.540> starting<00:03:18.540> back<00:03:18.660> from<00:03:18.840> the
