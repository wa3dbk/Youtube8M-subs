00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
new york city of course i guess that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.590 
new york city of course i guess that
makes<00:01:21.479> sense<00:01:22.040> because<00:01:23.040> technically<00:01:24.000> liberty

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
makes sense because technically liberty

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.850 
makes sense because technically liberty
city<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> based<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> new<00:01:26.040> york<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.299> yeah

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
city is based off of new york so yeah

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
city is based off of new york so yeah
now<00:01:28.860> speaking<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> grand<00:01:29.610> theft<00:01:29.670> auto<00:01:29.970> four<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
about the same thing when i did the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.429

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
why they did this I can only think of
two<00:01:48.570> reasons<00:01:48.920> one<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.640> give<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:50.970> bit

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
two reasons one is to give a little bit

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.289

more<00:01:51.270> variety<00:01:51.420> among<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> cars<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:53.520> two<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
more variety among the cars but two I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.539 
more variety among the cars but two I
think<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> throwback<00:01:55.649> idea<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> Grand

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
