00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.400
 so hello dear friends we are 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.790
 we can begin more precisely we continue 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.320
 create our game on unity3d and i decided 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.960
 here remember 11 is our scene that is 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.960
 we created very long ago with my new and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 never used it i think if 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 you know a little about unit then i think you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.820
 again you know how to create constantly 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 how do they create some buttons in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 Generally it is not so difficult to give 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.530
 Today we will deal with this if you do not know 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 then again welcome even 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 You know, I think you will not hurt it yet 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 just remember so let's go to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 Our scene I already passed in this Ainu new 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.280
 I also created a script called 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.719
 main menu script 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 now i'm going to monodevel 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.760
 or which code editor you use and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.339
 here and let's write 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.450
 a method which will be named like 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450
 he usually gui 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:24.880
 here let's create conditions right away 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:30.300
 we will not do anything as well, and the button 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.570
 create a button at the beginning it will be with us 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.810
 The rectangle will continue to be a string object. 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.200
 of string type this will be what is indicated 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 on the button itself and in rect 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.619
 and here we indicate the coordinates 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.850
 I explained it all to me in 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.060
 some 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:02:00.820
 lessons in general i think you already know that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:03.540
 so what's next is the text 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.540
 start 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.290
 should now be with parentheses 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.890
 a little problem like nothing yet 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 I see everything is fine and let's create 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.290
 First, let's call the print method here. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 see start game 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.820
 see and here started the game 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.760
 have we run laval clouds still low 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.540
 swam 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.320
 here it is necessary to specify an index of type int it 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.800
 our room index is also possible 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.820
 specify the name let's punish soon 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.990
 the name that was so convenient is ours 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.990
 name game 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.390
 First, let's look at build 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.500
 settings 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.890
 what's with us so what's wrong with us 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.960
 yet no sam add add my 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.800
 view as a zero scene and add with us 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.970
 nothing you need to protect you one more 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.860
 the scene and the same game 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.280
 and so it is with us under the index 1 go 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.960
 again my all on her we have created 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.130
 let's see what we did I forgot 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.760
 This script and transfer to the main camera 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.760
 script my opinion 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.959
 In this case, the main camera can be 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.450
 leave leave as is that is not 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.819
 change anything so we have a button 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.370
 start if we push it then he 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.000
 move the game itself and the game begins 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.959
 please do the same thing we did 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.599
 just the main menu and let's now 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.400
 make another button just i think 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:12.299
 copy so as not to occupy me your 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.299
 time loaf yurik will be about what 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:21.419
 70 probably 787 this is a little game also she 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.070
 will be the same size to be 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:33.530
 prettier little and write exit here 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:36.300
 and here we don't need to load some 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.669
 level because we just want to get out 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.349
 games but again we are from i think i will you 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.490
 show from failed because we are now 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:49.370
 We run the unity itself, so 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:52.610
 me out the most impossible to get out from 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.949
 we very much this is not all happening a 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.520
 Here we have two keys I've found at 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:07.009
 start and immediately the game started but let's 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.009
 do so again 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:15.059
 so Iâ€™m a little of you 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:21.259
 trust i will create xh nobody has everything 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:21.259
 run the game and so plex plex 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.310
 we create a scene so she usually 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.150
 nothing surprising is created 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.000
 Now I have a window opened 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.520
 make the quality of the graphics don't think that 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.500
 this is what will happen with us 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:55.060
 here we have the unity logo again 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.220
 the game itself is start and oxide click on 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.099
 the elder we have started the game that is 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.490
 this cat is okay so we need more 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.440
 still need to provide all the way out 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.039
 the main menu but it will be in the following 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.220
 lessons 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:16.470
 and if I quit the game now the window 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.000
 disappear so i think this is all thanks 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.210
 our video, we consider in more detail 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.430
 more about the scene try and action with them 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.550
 while you subscribe 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.550
