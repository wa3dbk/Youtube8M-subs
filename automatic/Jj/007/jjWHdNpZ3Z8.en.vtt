00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.630
 want to play the best games since this 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 conceived by the authors of the highest graphics 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 in full hd resolution 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 but spending a small state budget 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.840
 for the purchase of video card option is not for you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.420
 then we present gigabyte gtx760 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.539
 one of the quietest and most powerful 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.720
 video cards for experienced players 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.300
 gtx760 is the closest gtx670 so 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.679
 the difference between generations 6 and 7 is extremely 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.860
 height in this segment 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.660
 but gtx760 any modern games will go 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.370
 at the time of the publication of the video in resolution 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.100
 full hd with maximum settings 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 graphics or close to them begin 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.989
 familiar with the configuration in our 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.969
 sample and this version is thousands of 33 megahertz 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.710
 there is an instruction where in detail 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.809
 talked about all the main elements 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 cards and how its safe 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.280
 install connect and configure 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 There is also a CD with drivers and drivers. 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.789
 if you watch this video then for sure 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 can download the latest version 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.539
 programs and drivers from official 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.369
 gigabyte and nvidia sites for 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 compatibility with old power supplies 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.020
 Included are two adapters with 4 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.790
 contact power most often to him 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.479
 connected hard drives and the idea and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.400
 disk drives on 6 contact pisya I certainly 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.140
 included is the graphics card itself 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 it is packed in a thick plastic 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 located inside softening foam 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 to get the video card from the package 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 just enough to open a small 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.909
 a piece of scotch and no sudden movements 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.740
 extract it now to appearance length 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.240
 video card two hundred sixty five 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 millimeters by the standards so much 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.750
 very few productive models 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 Yes, and a modest weight of only 1 and 4 kilograms 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.840
 Card 2 slot takes and requires 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.869
 air inlet space 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 so that the cooling goes as we intended 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.659
 in gigabytes we are proud of how quiet 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.729
 maybe your gtx gaming card 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 760 can stay quiet cold even 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 in the most sophisticated and graphically perfect 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 games this superiority provides 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 windforce cooling system 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.899
 PCB provides installation 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.240
 and other cooling systems so besides 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.819
 regular holes there are seven more points 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.800
 mounting if you look under the grill 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.080
 cooling and on the back of the card 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.500
 you will see another pride high 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.390
 will find 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.880
 other components that prolong life 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.340
 devices and improve the quality of the system 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.440
 here everything that is possible from 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.750
 solid state capacitors japanese 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.610
 production and memory of thier 1 to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.830
 special boost items 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.320
 simple voltage switching speed 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.570
 everything works fast and reliably 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.200
 output image is through 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.890
 four connectors 2 9 different versions as well 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.810
 full hdmi and displayport hdmi in 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.060
 In this case, as it should be for the best 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 work is covered with gold next to it is 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.350
 a small lattice injected through it 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.570
 fan and air can go away 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.730
 outside let's try this miracle in 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.980
 real games and synthetic tests 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.800
 the results are more than impressive 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.320
 only the 3d test became a serious test 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.930
 mark fire strike handling huge 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.000
 the number of small particles tessellation bulk 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.680
 light effects fog still many 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.290
 The factors of this test made 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.630
 drop the frame rate below 20 not 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.160
 you are scared we never win anywhere 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.459
 find the same load 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.340
 them gta4 throne failed to strain them 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.680
 760 dozens of different game tests 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.140
 left the frame rate higher or equal 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.780
 60 at the highest possible settings 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.239
 and resolution full hd in two-three games 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.519
 a year ago for example just cause 2 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.440
 it was possible to include 32 without complications 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.720
 multiple full-screen anti-aliasing and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.049
 maximum settings keeping frequency 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.450
 frames at 50 60 in all three test 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.760
 the verdict is unambiguous if you want 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 play all games and not think about 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.100
 updates several years gigabyte 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.650
 gtx760 cooling system have enforce 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.850
 can be a great choice there is 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.100
 Of course, reasons to look for more 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.739
 productive solutions and their 2 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.320
 the video card will be more powerful by the way for the game 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.560
 on multiple monitors in 2k resolution 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.350
 and 4k as well as for professional tasks 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.000
 like video processing and 3d graphics 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.010
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.040
 join us and play with 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.040
 pleasure
