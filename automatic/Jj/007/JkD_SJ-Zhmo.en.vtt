 Lower favo then the lights before kids hit 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:18.369
 And Johns 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:20.289
 It is thrown into the deep place of the first run 3 run home run left middle and it is a good form with 3 to 0 with this 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.610

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.610
 The supervision of the land is also a smile 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.190
 Now On the other hand mouth seeing to return to Hauser of the starting lineup this season 3 there has been a starter in the game first time 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.110
 Let's go 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.460

 The picture is a strikeout 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.699
 It is three consecutive strikeouts 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.699
 It will be a start of the form that I cut a Softbank lesson and made it to Cuba. 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.570
 I 'm going to simmer the Lander from the two back plates Now and 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.040
 About Tsuka Okajima 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.970
 And but now the bottom unreasonable one of the right intermediate 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.240
 The fourth point enters 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.690
 Then give a valuable additional point 5 points also three times 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.100
 Meeting is in the middle 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.100
 Five times the table is a burger from this Hauser from a two-out runner first base 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:22.970
 This will be again 3-point difference in the very withstand you let alone beat the long visit of flight time 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.970
 However, I take this Takedao with Rakuten One Naute Cool Base behind it 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.180
 On the chance of having 3 fur balls 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.070

 This is the runner sweep 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:46.050
 Mitaka is a touch-out but I want to wear it with a memorial sky base that should be clean 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.050
 Take the lead of the game's largest 6 points 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.930
