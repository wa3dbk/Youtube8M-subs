recognize<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.430> today<00:00:57.789> most<00:00:58.629> women<00:00:59.019> just<00:00:59.289> do

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
recognize that today most women just do

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.310 
recognize that today most women just do
not<00:00:59.620> have<00:00:59.679> a<00:00:59.920> lot<00:01:00.219> of<00:01:00.250> time<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.789> spend<00:01:01.109> hours<00:01:02.109> in

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
not have a lot of time to spend hours in

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.689 
not have a lot of time to spend hours in
the<00:01:02.440> kitchen<00:01:02.469> whether<00:01:02.949> it's<00:01:03.129> cooking<00:01:03.280> or

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
the kitchen whether it's cooking or

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.160 
the kitchen whether it's cooking or
whether<00:01:03.910> it's<00:01:04.090> even<00:01:04.150> making<00:01:04.570> products<00:01:05.050> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
whether it's even making products and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.780 
whether it's even making products and
even<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.530> notion<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:05.980> making<00:01:06.310> products<00:01:06.700> is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
even the notion of making products is

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.330 
even the notion of making products is
relatively<00:01:07.240> new<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.110> like<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.890> idea<00:01:08.950> of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
relatively new so I like the idea of

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.920 
relatively new so I like the idea of
women<00:01:09.460> being<00:01:09.760> their<00:01:09.940> own<00:01:10.060> kitchen<00:01:10.540> chemists

moisturizer spritz very very easy rose

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.590 
moisturizer spritz very very easy rose
water<00:01:20.619> and<00:01:21.009> rose<00:01:21.640> water<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.090> really<00:01:22.329> really

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
water and rose water is really really

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.539 
water and rose water is really really
good<00:01:22.840> because<00:01:23.020> rose<00:01:23.530> water<00:01:23.829> essentially<00:01:24.280> is

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
good because rose water essentially is

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.179 
good because rose water essentially is
made<00:01:25.180> from<00:01:25.479> rose<00:01:25.810> petals<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.470> water<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.070> it's

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
made from rose petals and water and it's

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.859 
made from rose petals and water and it's
just<00:01:27.340> goes<00:01:27.790> through<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.150> distillation

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
just goes through this distillation

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.440 
just goes through this distillation
process<00:01:29.439> where<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.130> water<00:01:30.369> like<00:01:31.030> once<00:01:31.329> you

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
process where the water like once you

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.719 
process where the water like once you
take<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.840> roses<00:01:32.259> out<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.950> has<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.310> properties

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
take the roses out it has the properties

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.370 
take the roses out it has the properties
of<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.909> rose<00:01:34.060> which<00:01:34.240> are<00:01:34.329> very<00:01:34.659> very<00:01:34.869> slopping

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
of the rose which are very very slopping

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.920 
of the rose which are very very slopping
they've<00:01:35.590> been<00:01:35.740> used<00:01:36.009> in<00:01:36.479> beauty<00:01:37.479> treatments

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
they've been used in beauty treatments

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.480 
they've been used in beauty treatments
for<00:01:38.079> centuries<00:01:38.470> yes

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
for centuries yes

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.950 
for centuries yes
and<00:01:39.759> so<00:01:39.939> there's<00:01:40.119> rose<00:01:40.299> water<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.810> can

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
and so there's rose water and you can

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.170 
and so there's rose water and you can
typically<00:01:41.290> find<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.890> at<00:01:42.159> health<00:01:42.970> food

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
typically find this at health food

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.859 
typically find this at health food
stores<00:01:43.509> or<00:01:43.659> even<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.969> Middle<00:01:45.969> Eastern<00:01:46.390> markets

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
stores or even in Middle Eastern markets

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.719 
stores or even in Middle Eastern markets
because<00:01:47.259> they<00:01:47.290> use<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.680> lot<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:47.979> rose<00:01:48.189> water<00:01:48.399> and

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
because they use a lot of rose water and

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.960 
because they use a lot of rose water and
we're<00:01:48.880> cooking
