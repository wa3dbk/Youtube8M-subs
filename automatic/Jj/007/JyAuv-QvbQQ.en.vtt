BitFenix colossus chasis all of the LED
fans<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.270> come<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.659> five<00:01:10.049> different<00:01:10.229> colors

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
fans they come in five different colors

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.850 
fans they come in five different colors
we<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.310> red<00:01:11.670> green<00:01:12.180> blue<00:01:12.540> white<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.439> orange

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
we have red green blue white and orange

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.999 
we have red green blue white and orange
but<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.689> LEDs<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> don't

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
but if you don't like LEDs if you don't

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
but if you don't like LEDs if you don't
like<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> lightning<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:19.049> also<00:01:19.170> come

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
like a lot of lightning they also come

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.499 
like a lot of lightning they also come
in<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.920> black<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.869> white<00:01:23.240> now

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.050 

all<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.900> Specter<00:01:28.770> fans<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
all of these Specter fans they use the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.359 
all of these Specter fans they use the
same<00:01:30.090> type<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:31.610> sick<00:01:32.610> cold<00:01:32.820> blade<00:01:33.240> fan<00:01:33.720> design

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
same type of sick cold blade fan design

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.179 
same type of sick cold blade fan design
the<00:01:35.369> sickle<00:01:36.030> blade<00:01:36.350> has<00:01:37.350> very<00:01:37.619> low<00:01:37.920> air

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the sickle blade has very low air

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
the sickle blade has very low air
resistance<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.390> silent<00:01:39.810> fan<00:01:40.229> at

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
resistance so it's a very silent fan at

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
resistance so it's a very silent fan at
the<00:01:40.890> same<00:01:41.130> time<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.640> does<00:01:41.820> push<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> lot<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> air

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the same time it does push a lot of air

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.780 
the same time it does push a lot of air
so<00:01:42.960> airflow<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.560> performance<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.579> still

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so airflow and performance is still

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
so airflow and performance is still
still<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.170> while<00:01:46.649> keeping<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> noise

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
still up there while keeping the noise

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.690 
still up there while keeping the noise
down<00:01:48.079> they<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:49.290> use<00:01:49.619> something<00:01:50.220> called<00:01:50.310> fluid

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
down they all use something called fluid

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.899 
down they all use something called fluid
dynamic<00:01:51.509> bearings<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:54.049> these<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.909> high

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
dynamic bearings and these are very high

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.459 
dynamic bearings and these are very high
performance<00:01:57.509> bearings<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> long

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
performance bearings they have a long

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.020 
performance bearings they have a long
life<00:01:58.680> expectancy<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.820> they're<00:02:00.000> very

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
life expectancy and they're very

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.889 
life expectancy and they're very
efficient<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.710> silent<00:02:02.360> now<00:02:03.360> speaking

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
efficient also very silent now speaking

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.249

nine Spectre LED fans and I'm going to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.190 
nine Spectre LED fans and I'm going to
show<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.170> how<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.530> connect<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.070> thing<00:02:54.200> so

when you buy a Spectre LED fan out of
the<00:02:59.190> box<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.730> works<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.060> any<00:03:00.360> normal<00:03:00.630> LED<00:03:01.170> fan

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the box it works like any normal LED fan

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.370 
the box it works like any normal LED fan
you<00:03:01.860> plug<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.820> into<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.540> power<00:03:03.959> supply<00:03:04.170> or

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
on the LED fans it's got this to pin

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.699 
on the LED fans it's got this to pin
little<00:03:17.160> jumper<00:03:17.579> here<00:03:17.790> which<00:03:18.269> if<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.500> leave<00:03:19.680> it

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
little jumper here which if you leave it

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.819 
little jumper here which if you leave it
in<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.790> will<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.030> always<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.750> standard<00:03:22.260> LED<00:03:22.590> fan

however<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.760> disconnect<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:25.549> like<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.820> and

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
however if you disconnect it like so and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.759 
however if you disconnect it like so and
use<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.920> included<00:03:29.630> 90<00:03:30.630> centimeter<00:03:31.200> cable
