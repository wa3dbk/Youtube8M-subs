sort of EQ that you can you can use
another<00:02:19.810> thing<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.380> they<00:02:20.500> did<00:02:20.709> was<00:02:20.739> a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
another thing that they did was a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.210 
another thing that they did was a
highway<00:02:21.070> 1<00:02:21.430> series<00:02:21.820> with<00:02:22.030> these<00:02:22.150> pickups<00:02:22.660> is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
highway 1 series with these pickups is

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.069 
highway 1 series with these pickups is
that<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.120> middle<00:02:25.420> position<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.959> this

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
that in the middle position on this

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.699 
that in the middle position on this
Telecaster<00:02:26.829> it<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.610> hum<00:02:27.970> canceling<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.350> one<00:02:29.680> of

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
Telecaster it is hum canceling so one of

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.650 
Telecaster it is hum canceling so one of
the<00:02:29.860> pickups<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.370> reverse<00:02:30.790> won't<00:02:31.120> reverse

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the pickups is reverse won't reverse

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.600 
the pickups is reverse won't reverse
polarity<00:02:32.079> so<00:02:32.530> if<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.769> need<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.070> use<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> lead

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
polarity so if you need to use a lead

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.130 
polarity so if you need to use a lead
sound<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.329> don't<00:02:34.510> want<00:02:34.660> any<00:02:34.840> noise<00:02:35.110> any

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
sound and you don't want any noise any

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.440 
sound and you don't want any noise any
buzzing<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.190> right<00:02:36.700> there<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:39.450> also

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
buzzing it's right there for you also

buzzing it's right there for you also
with<00:02:40.840> these<00:02:40.959> pickups<00:02:41.380> there<00:02:41.530> are<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> little

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
with these pickups there are a little

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.710 
with these pickups there are a little
bit<00:02:41.950> different<00:02:42.310> than<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.549> typical<00:02:42.790> Telecaster
