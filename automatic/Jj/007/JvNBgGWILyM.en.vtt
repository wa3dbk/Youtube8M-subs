abuse the beatdown it's like an

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.039 
abuse the beatdown it's like an
evolution<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.500> Ric<00:01:34.680> Flair<00:01:35.240> when<00:01:36.240> NWO

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

evolution it was Ric Flair when NWO
there<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> whole<00:01:37.560> bunch<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> guys<00:01:38.100> bossman

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
there was a whole bunch of guys bossman

Virgil<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.840> list<00:01:40.049> goes<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.920> was

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
Virgil the list goes on and on that was

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.289 
Virgil the list goes on and on that was
probably<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.549> bad<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
probably the one bad thing about the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210 
probably the one bad thing about the
nwo's<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.320> many<00:01:43.470> guys<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
nwo's they put so many guys in there to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
nwo's they put so many guys in there to
take<00:01:44.369> Falls<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.909> Michael<00:01:45.210> Wall<00:01:45.390> Street<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
take Falls like Michael Wall Street and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.899 
take Falls like Michael Wall Street and
everybody<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.799> every<00:01:47.670> group<00:01:47.880> has

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
everybody like that but every group has

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.359 
everybody like that but every group has
that<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.450> guy<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:50.009> probably<00:01:50.130> going

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that one guy and that's probably going

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
that one guy and that's probably going
to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.520> McGillicuddy<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> end

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to be McGillicuddy but in the end

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.359 
to be McGillicuddy but in the end
they'll<00:01:52.200> probably<00:01:52.470> come<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.829> sparkling

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
