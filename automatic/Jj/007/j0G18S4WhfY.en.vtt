00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
twisted Christmas to update I've been

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.269 
twisted Christmas to update I've been
playing<00:00:29.939> killing<00:00:30.270> for<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.260> long<00:00:31.710> time<00:00:32.070> now

playing killing for for a long time now

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.740 
playing killing for for a long time now
I<00:00:32.910> played<00:00:33.539> it<00:00:33.660> since<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.019> was<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> quake<00:00:34.470> mod<00:00:34.770> I

think it's a lot of people say that it's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.530 
think it's a lot of people say that it's
a<00:00:38.820> ripoff<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.630> left<00:00:40.020> 4<00:00:40.200> dead<00:00:40.969> that's<00:00:41.969> because

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
