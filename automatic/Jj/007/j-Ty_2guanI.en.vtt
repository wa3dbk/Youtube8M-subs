00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
let that concrete and the joints dry
underneath<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.379> stone<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:17.039> well<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
underneath the stone as well as the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.109 
underneath the stone as well as the
joint<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:19.380> through<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.310> once

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
joint going through here and once

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.529 
joint going through here and once
they're<00:00:21.359> dry<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.990> define<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.859> seat

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
they're dry you can define the seat

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:34.930 
they're dry you can define the seat
alright<00:00:24.539> well<00:00:24.930> we'll<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.289> back<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> then

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.060 

now<00:00:35.940> clean<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> ass<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> stuff<00:00:37.559> there's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
now clean from the ass and stuff there's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.369 
now clean from the ass and stuff there's
one<00:00:38.370> last<00:00:38.760> step<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
one last step to it and what is that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.490 
one last step to it and what is that
that<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.100> basically<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.820> seal<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:43.020> protect

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that is basically to seal it to protect

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.330 
that is basically to seal it to protect
it<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:45.329> climate<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.950> area

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it from the climate here in this area

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.020 
it from the climate here in this area
you<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> thawing<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.710> freezing<00:00:50.030> cycle

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you have the thawing and freezing cycle

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990 
you have the thawing and freezing cycle
throughout<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.260> winter<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.340> extremely

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
throughout the winter and it's extremely

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.610 
throughout the winter and it's extremely
hard<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.629> joints<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.610> flagstone<00:00:57.149> itself

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
hard on joints and the flagstone itself

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.970 
hard on joints and the flagstone itself
so<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> prevent<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.579> make<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> last<00:01:00.719> longer<00:01:00.980> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so to prevent and make it last longer we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.420 
so to prevent and make it last longer we
take<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.520> sealer<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> siloxane<00:01:06.979> pour<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
take a sealer this siloxane pour it in a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.590 
take a sealer this siloxane pour it in a
pan<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.420> extremely<00:01:10.200> simple<00:01:11.600> pouring

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
pan and is it extremely simple pouring

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.440 
pan and is it extremely simple pouring
it<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.369> take<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.119> paint

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it in there and we take just a paint

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.310 
it in there and we take just a paint
roller<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.020> spread

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
roller you like this and then you spread

material<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.770> shows<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
material as you can see it shows kind of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.190 
material as you can see it shows kind of
milky<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> white<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.960> to

I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.860> here<00:01:52.860> 72<00:01:53.729> hours<00:01:54.210> after<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.810> put

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I think on here 72 hours after you put

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.850 
I think on here 72 hours after you put
it<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> Cabot<00:01:56.820> dry<00:01:57.630> put<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> liberally

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it on to a Cabot dry put it liberally

it on to a Cabot dry put it liberally
where<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> joints<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.469> because<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
where the joints are because you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.359 
where the joints are because you
definitely<00:02:02.280> want<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> protect<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> joints

see there next to the house and that
helps<00:02:07.989> it<00:02:08.989> helps<00:02:09.289> prevent<00:02:09.739> moisture<00:02:10.540> speci<00:02:11.540> in

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
helps it helps prevent moisture speci in

the<00:02:11.780> winter<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.709> get<00:02:12.890> into<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.459> joints<00:02:14.060> and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the winter to get into the joints and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.339 
the winter to get into the joints and
then<00:02:15.410> expand<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.280> freeze<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.090> then<00:02:17.510> pop<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
then expand and freeze and then pop the

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.990 
then expand and freeze and then pop the
joints<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.620> see<00:02:21.890> we<00:02:22.129> took<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.370> smaller

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
joints as you can see we took a smaller

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.530 
joints as you can see we took a smaller
section<00:02:23.420> here<00:02:24.110> but<00:02:25.010> we<00:02:25.220> are<00:02:25.340> having<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.450> they

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
section here but we are having and they

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.000 
section here but we are having and they
just<00:02:26.750> do<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:26.989> over<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.290> whole<00:02:27.379> pad<00:02:27.739> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
just do that over the whole pad and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.670 
just do that over the whole pad and
everything<00:02:28.489> is<00:02:28.580> good<00:02:28.790> right<00:02:29.000> exactly

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
everything is good right exactly

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.170 
everything is good right exactly

you usually with one gallon you can for
the<00:02:35.239> most<00:02:35.269> part<00:02:35.750> go<00:02:35.989> about<00:02:36.200> 200<00:02:36.860> square<00:02:37.040> feet

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549

the most part go about 200 square feet
so<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.599> patio<00:02:39.140> being<00:02:39.440> about<00:02:39.709> 500<00:02:40.579> square

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
so this patio being about 500 square

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.610 
so this patio being about 500 square
feet<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.799> would<00:02:42.980> need<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:45.110> would<00:02:45.260> need<00:02:45.440> about

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
feet you would need you would need about

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.119 
feet you would need you would need about
two<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.160> half<00:02:46.190> or<00:02:46.610> three<00:02:46.730> towers<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:48.560> 93

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
two and a half or three towers to 93

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.699 
two and a half or three towers to 93
gallons<00:02:49.579> but<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.209> excellent<00:02:50.930> stuff<00:02:51.410> it

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
gallons but this is excellent stuff it

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.490 
gallons but this is excellent stuff it
prevents<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:53.209> moisture<00:02:53.750> from<00:02:53.930> going<00:02:54.290> into

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
prevents the moisture from going into

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.520 
prevents the moisture from going into
the<00:02:54.769> joints<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.480> also<00:02:56.480> lets<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.900> material

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
the joints and also lets the material

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.839 
the joints and also lets the material
breathe<00:02:58.660> after<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:00.920> put<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.310> down<00:03:01.549> and

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
breathe after you have put it down and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.550 
breathe after you have put it down and
how<00:03:02.230> how<00:03:03.230> often<00:03:03.440> should<00:03:03.739> they<00:03:03.799> seal<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:06.140> best

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
how how often should they seal the best

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.970 
how how often should they seal the best
way<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.890> test<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:08.139> every<00:03:09.139> year<00:03:09.500> take<00:03:09.950> a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
way to test that is every year take a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.559 
way to test that is every year take a
cup<00:03:10.700> full<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.120> water<00:03:11.950> put<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.069> anywhere<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:14.209> on

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
cup full of water put it anywhere and on

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.069 
cup full of water put it anywhere and on
here<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:15.380> if<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.069> still<00:03:16.400> bubbles<00:03:17.120> out<00:03:17.389> you

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
here and if it still bubbles out you

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.650 
here and if it still bubbles out you
know<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.100> sealer<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:20.030> still<00:03:20.329> working

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
know that the sealer is still working
