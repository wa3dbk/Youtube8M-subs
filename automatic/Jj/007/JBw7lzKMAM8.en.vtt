00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you're playing and the whole thing is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500

all falling into the water below this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
all falling into the water below this
has<00:00:55.020> gameplay<00:00:55.500> implications<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
has gameplay implications as it is

difficult<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.390> aim<00:00:57.629> during<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> quakes<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
difficult to aim during the quakes and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.279 
difficult to aim during the quakes and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
difficult to be stealthy wall splashing
through<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> water<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> lot<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
through the water so there's a lot of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140 
through the water so there's a lot of
different<00:01:04.140> environment<00:01:04.739> changes<00:01:05.220> also<00:01:05.610> with

artillery I'm going to read a little bit

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.399 
artillery I'm going to read a little bit
about<00:01:08.189> artillery<00:01:08.840> artillery<00:01:09.840> starts<00:01:10.260> out

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
about artillery artillery starts out

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.469 
about artillery artillery starts out
looking<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.799> an<00:01:10.950> ordinary<00:01:11.280> military<00:01:12.180> base

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
looking like an ordinary military base

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
looking like an ordinary military base
but<00:01:13.200> during<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> gameplay<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.430> you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but during the gameplay as you're

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.210 
but during the gameplay as you're
playing<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.180> storm<00:01:15.630> kicks<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.220> lightning

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
playing a storm kicks up lightning

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100 
playing a storm kicks up lightning
begins<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> flash<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> horizon<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
begins to flash on the horizon and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
begins to flash on the horizon and
eventually<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> tornado<00:01:20.159> develops<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> sweeps

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
eventually a tornado develops and sweeps

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.280 
eventually a tornado develops and sweeps
near<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> play<00:01:21.930> space<00:01:22.259> dust<00:01:23.159> debris<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.720> dust

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
near the play space dust debris a dust

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.810 
near the play space dust debris a dust
and<00:01:25.470> debris<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.860> kicked<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.310> making<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and debris are kicked up making it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.600 
and debris are kicked up making it
difficult<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.920> buffering<00:01:29.310> winds

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
difficult to see and the buffering winds

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.840 
difficult to see and the buffering winds
can<00:01:29.970> mask<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.900> approach<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.640> guessing

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
can mask your approach so I'm guessing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
can mask your approach so I'm guessing
people<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:34.070> camping<00:01:35.070> those<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.490> be

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the storm to kick up so they can blend
