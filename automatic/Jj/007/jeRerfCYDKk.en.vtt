00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.160
 to prepare lentils with chorizo ​​and potato 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.769
 for this we need lentils that we have 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.110
 had all the night soaking we have 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.689
 water changed and now we already have 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.560
 with water ready to meet them and two 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.230
 bay leaves 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.930
 we need garlic onion green pepper 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.770
 and carrot chorizo ​​potatoes paprika 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.770
 olive oil and salt 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.780
 well, we cut the pepper 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.300
 pieces of green 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.820
 we have here some garlics with skin and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.670
 all we have chopped carrot 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.620
 we have chopped the two potatoes the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.719
 onion in a piece of onion not very 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.540
 great also chopped and chorizo 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.730
 Now we're going to put all this in the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.940
 casserole where we have the lentils with 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.820
 water carrying a chorradita of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.380
 oil and two bay leaves 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.380
 then we add everything 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.380
 once it starts to boil we will go down 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.990
 the fire so that it does not boil 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.910
 because if we do not break our skin 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 the lentils have to boil 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.610
 gently but now in principle that 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.380
 take strength to prepare the solution of 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.470
 the lentils we put in a pan 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.260
 small oil and a few teeth of 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.850
 garlic when they are golden we will remove them 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:41.720
 and in this same oil we will throw 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.720
 post ag a little tiny onion 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.229
 once we have removed the garlic 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.909
 golden ones we have put the chopped onion 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.140
 we've put in a little salt and now 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.140
 we will let it punch 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.960
 we already have pochada the onion now 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.560
 we add a 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 a little bit of paprika we sauté 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:16.670
 and we add it to the capture 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.670
 where we have everything cooking gently 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.280
 now and we will also add a bit of 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:27.019
 Now go to the pot because the legume 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.540
 it is first cooked without salt and now 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.790
 It has been a while since we added the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.030
 so let's put the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.030
 Salt 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.650
 we will try it 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 and that it comes down smoothly so that it does not 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.790
 Lentils break a lot 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.430
 to dad 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.730
 well we already have our lentils with 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:06.140
 We have had chorizo ​​and potatoes 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.930
 cooking approximately 30 to 35 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.819
 minutes that is already choosing lentils 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.760
 and if you see that they are soft because 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.950
 it is as it is it is pardina lentil that is 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.430
 of the little girl then and has been in 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.379
 soak it cooks very easily 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.900
 then this is the result because the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.150
 we have viruses 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.099
 and now once replaced and we only 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.099
 is to catch the spoon and enjoy
