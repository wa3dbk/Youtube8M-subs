00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.890
 of humanity 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.220
 1 of 2013 this entrepreneur and inventor 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.050
 born in the usa spoke for the first time 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 of his idea of ​​bringing human beings to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.480
 red planet for the next decade 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.809
 in January 2013 he reported his plans 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.600
 to build a settlement for 80,000 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.530
 people on Mars when technology 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.230
 make possible the life of the man there 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.480
 now his plans have increased to a 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.730
 million people that according to the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.079
 entrepreneur could be part of a 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.390
 sustainable colony on this planet 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.149
 the general manager of spacex is 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.710
 sure that the future of humanity 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.690
 it depends on our ability to go more 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 from the earth to space 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.600
 I think there is a strong argument 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.909
 humanitarian to make life multi 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.100
 planetary in order to safeguard the

 existence of humanity in the case of 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 that something catastrophic happened 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 in this case be poor or have a 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.619
 disease would not be relevant because the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.180
 humanity would be extinguished opined mus 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.180
 the American whose companies 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.250
 include tesla motors and paypal and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.979
 he elaborated the payment plan for his colony 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.020
 Martian according to which the people who 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.170
 want to create a farm in space 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.270
 will have to pay their own travel the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.850
 who want to go to Mars will have to be 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.920
 saving all the money and selling all 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 his things just as the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.750
 people who moved to the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 first american colonies 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.460
 but also warns that life in the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.310
 Red planet would be difficult because of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.160
 inhospitable conditions and obstacles 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.470
 unknown as well as instability 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.649
 of colonial governments could 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.929
 provoke a civil war anarchy and 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.480
 even cannibalism given the safe 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.480
 shortage of supplies on Mars 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.900
