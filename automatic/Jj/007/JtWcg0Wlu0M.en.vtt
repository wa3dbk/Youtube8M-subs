00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
that's one oz and we gotta mix it with

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
that's one oz and we gotta mix it with
one<00:00:34.559> odds<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.820> Laura<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:38.270> don't

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
but that's pretty much raised damaging

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.750 
but that's pretty much raised damaging
yes<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.710> once<00:01:02.710> again<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:03.310> can't<00:01:03.940> see<00:01:04.390> right<00:01:04.900> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
yes and once again I can't see right in

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.080 
yes and once again I can't see right in
the<00:01:06.760> backwards<00:01:07.360> camera<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:09.400> usually<00:01:09.850> have

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
the backwards camera and I usually have

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.330 
the backwards camera and I usually have
a<00:01:10.360> very<00:01:10.980> big<00:01:12.000> block<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:14.260> know<00:01:14.320> I'm<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.010> going

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
a very big block you know I'm just going

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.440 
a very big block you know I'm just going
to<00:01:15.370> do<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.640> really<00:01:16.300> messy<00:01:16.720> because<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:18.450> am

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
to do it really messy because I am

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.690 
to do it really messy because I am
having<00:01:19.750> troubles<00:01:20.530> today

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.050 

I<00:01:24.789> actually<00:01:25.450> think<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:26.140> mean<00:01:26.380> oh<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.850> gosh<00:01:28.090> oh<00:01:30.060> my

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:46.990 
I actually think I mean oh my gosh oh my
gosh<00:01:38.610> yeah

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.800 

if<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.750> can't<00:01:48.020> tell<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:48.710> already<00:01:49.540> failing<00:01:50.540> in

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
if you can't tell I'm already failing in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.360 
if you can't tell I'm already failing in
the<00:01:50.990> backwards<00:01:51.590> camera<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:54.590> putting<00:01:55.070> this

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
the backwards camera that putting this

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.840 
the backwards camera that putting this
Neutron<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:57.310> if<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.490> want<00:01:58.760> it<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.210> process

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
Neutron and if you want it to process

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.100 
Neutron and if you want it to process
faster<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:02.630> suggest<00:02:03.350> blow<00:02:04.100> drying<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.240> high

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.140 

so<00:03:36.709> it's<00:03:36.800> pretty<00:03:36.950> much<00:03:37.069> what<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.459> do<00:03:37.640> you

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
so it's pretty much what you do you

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.970 
so it's pretty much what you do you
should<00:03:38.330> probably<00:03:38.690> part<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.319> I<00:03:39.500> just<00:03:39.740> do<00:03:39.950> it

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
should probably part it I just do it

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.050 
should probably part it I just do it
messy<00:03:40.459> because<00:03:40.900> I'm<00:03:41.900> in<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.080> rush<00:03:42.290> but<00:03:43.060> I'm

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
messy because I'm in a rush but I'm

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.680 
messy because I'm in a rush but I'm
turning<00:03:44.569> your<00:03:44.750> side<00:03:44.989> blue<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.420> redoing<00:03:47.420> this

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
turning your side blue and redoing this

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.910 
turning your side blue and redoing this
purple<00:03:48.170> because<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.640> feeds<00:03:49.940> too<00:03:50.300> fast<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:52.810> yep

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
purple because it feeds too fast but yep

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.080 
purple because it feeds too fast but yep
I'm<00:03:54.920> just<00:03:55.040> going<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.280> go<00:03:55.370> through<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.730> do<00:03:55.970> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
I'm just going to go through and do the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.690 
I'm just going to go through and do the
rest<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.480> probably<00:03:56.840> do<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.319> video<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.340> how<00:03:58.670> to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
rest and probably do a video on how to

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.400
