00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
they take down the Thai champion Luong

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
they take down the Thai champion Luong
very<00:01:35.070> easily<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> their

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
very easily but when they get to their

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
very easily but when they get to their
actual<00:01:37.020> battle<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.650> when<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> see

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
actual battle that's when you get to see

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.590 
actual battle that's when you get to see
how<00:01:38.340> their<00:01:38.490> abilities<00:01:38.880> work<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> their

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
how their abilities work and their

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450 
how their abilities work and their
fighting<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.500> massive<00:01:40.860> ruined

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
fighting in this like massive ruined

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
fighting in this like massive ruined
city<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.970> rain<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.079> gives<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> really

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
city with rain so it gives it a really

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.600 
city with rain so it gives it a really
great<00:01:43.770> atmosphere

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
great atmosphere

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.130 
great atmosphere
but<00:01:44.909> I'm<00:01:45.119> guessing<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.570> main<00:01:45.720> reason<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but I'm guessing the main reason that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
but I'm guessing the main reason that
it's<00:01:46.350> called<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.710> gym<00:01:46.920> sniper<00:01:47.280> k9<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.030> because

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's called the gym sniper k9 is because

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's called the gym sniper k9 is because
it<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.570> has<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.079> backpack<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:50.189> can

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it actually has this backpack which can

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
it actually has this backpack which can
detach<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.119> turn<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.659> like

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
detach and turn into this like

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.830 
detach and turn into this like
mechanical<00:01:52.740> dog<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> big<00:01:54.000> sniper<00:01:54.390> rifle

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
mechanical dog with a big sniper rifle

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.520 
mechanical dog with a big sniper rifle
on<00:01:54.960> its<00:01:55.110> back

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
on its back

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
on its back
just<00:01:55.710> think<00:01:55.950> crying<00:01:56.790> wolf<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.540> Metal<00:01:57.810> Gear

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
just think crying wolf from Metal Gear

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
just think crying wolf from Metal Gear
Solid<00:01:58.320> 4<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.799> backpack<00:01:59.189> ends<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.640> acting<00:02:00.000> as

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
Solid 4 the backpack ends up acting as

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
Solid 4 the backpack ends up acting as
like<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.570> self-propelled<00:02:01.530> artillery

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
like this self-propelled artillery

weapon and it's able to run across the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.719 
weapon and it's able to run across the
battlefield<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> way<00:02:05.189> they're<00:02:05.399> able<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
battlefield in this way they're able to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
amazing from a lot of different angles

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.260 
amazing from a lot of different angles
and<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.770> actually<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.550> trips<00:02:11.849> him<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.090> at

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
first because they end up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.020 
first because they end up
knocking<00:02:13.620> off<00:02:13.740> all<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.130> his<00:02:14.250> important<00:02:14.700> weapon

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
left and right and then he ends up

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
left and right and then he ends up
looking<00:02:18.570> like<00:02:18.750> he's<00:02:19.020> gonna<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.350> defeated<00:02:19.860> but

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.880 
which is exactly what the white base
tried<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.810> original<00:02:34.230> series<00:02:34.650> and

another secret weapon which a lot of
people<00:02:58.440> think<00:02:58.770> is<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.950> Trans<00:02:59.490> Am<00:02:59.700> system<00:03:00.240> from

people think is the Trans Am system from

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.850 
people think is the Trans Am system from
Gundam<00:03:00.750> double-o<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.380> actually<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
Gundam double-o but it's actually the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.190 
Gundam double-o but it's actually the
exam<00:03:02.250> system<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.940> that's<00:03:03.600> when<00:03:03.780> he<00:03:03.870> starts<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
exam system and that's when he starts to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200 
exam system and that's when he starts to
move<00:03:04.380> real<00:03:04.590> fast<00:03:04.800> with<00:03:05.100> his<00:03:05.190> two<00:03:05.400> swords<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
move real fast with his two swords and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.730 
move real fast with his two swords and
he<00:03:06.270> starts<00:03:06.510> like<00:03:06.570> slashing<00:03:07.020> them<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.440> this

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
he starts like slashing them up and this

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.230 
he starts like slashing them up and this
is<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.250> crazy<00:03:08.550> part<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> episode

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
is a really crazy part of the episode

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.700 
is a really crazy part of the episode
because<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.780> when<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.020> think<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.410> Yuki

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
because this is when you think that Yuki

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.310 
because this is when you think that Yuki
might<00:03:11.340> actually<00:03:11.580> lose<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.360> battle<00:03:12.810> but

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
might actually lose in this battle but

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.620 
might actually lose in this battle but
watch<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.250> intro<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.910> show<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.330> pretty

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
watch the intro of the show it's pretty

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.900 
watch the intro of the show it's pretty
damn<00:03:15.840> obvious<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.950> final<00:03:17.370> battle<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
damn obvious the final battle of the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.810 
damn obvious the final battle of the
series<00:03:18.270> is<00:03:18.450> almost<00:03:18.780> certainly<00:03:19.320> going<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.650> be

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
series is almost certainly going to be

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.340 
series is almost certainly going to be
Yuki<00:03:20.820> versus<00:03:21.300> Saiyan<00:03:21.660> rayji<00:03:22.020> they've<00:03:22.200> been

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
Yuki versus Saiyan rayji they've been

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.470 
Yuki versus Saiyan rayji they've been
building<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> entire<00:03:23.580> series<00:03:24.209> so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
building it up the entire series so

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970 
building it up the entire series so
that's<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:25.020> guessing<00:03:25.560> what's<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:25.950> to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
that's I'm guessing what's going to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.830 
that's I'm guessing what's going to
happen<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.640> cans<00:03:27.000> up<00:03:27.150> pulling<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.510> victory

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
happen but you cans up pulling a victory

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.300 
happen but you cans up pulling a victory
right<00:03:28.080> out<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.290> his<00:03:28.500> ass<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.830> don't<00:03:28.890> know<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
right out of his ass I don't know if it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.729 
right out of his ass I don't know if it
was<00:03:29.400> luck<00:03:29.670> or<00:03:30.180> if<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.420> was<00:03:30.510> skill<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.530> he

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
was luck or if it was skill but he

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.260 
was luck or if it was skill but he
manages<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.310> make<00:03:32.459> his<00:03:32.640> way<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.850> one<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.090> his

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
manages to make his way to one of his

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.940 
manages to make his way to one of his

could definitely take Yuki at this point
honestly<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.510> think<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.989> ila<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.530> gonna<00:03:58.709> be

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.930 
honestly I think that ila is gonna be
the<00:03:58.950> one<00:03:59.070> who's<00:03:59.310> gonna<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.610> one<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.880> the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
the one who's gonna be one of the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.090 
the one who's gonna be one of the
biggest<00:04:00.269> challenges<00:04:00.750> but<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.709> way<00:04:01.860> they've

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
biggest challenges but the way they've

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.650

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
said my only complaint was that the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.690 
said my only complaint was that the
first<00:04:29.620> half<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:29.980> episode<00:04:30.010> was<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.430> little

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
first half of the episode was a little

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.890 
first half of the episode was a little
slow<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.150> stuff<00:04:31.360> doesn't<00:04:31.540> really<00:04:31.750> do

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
slow and that stuff doesn't really do

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.600
