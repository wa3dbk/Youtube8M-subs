about four drops and I apply it to a a
cotton<00:01:59.920> ball<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:01.119> when<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.569> have<00:02:01.780> your

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
cotton ball now when you have your

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.989 
cotton ball now when you have your
full-size<00:02:02.380> kits<00:02:02.679> it's<00:02:02.950> actually<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.399> spray<00:02:03.789> and
