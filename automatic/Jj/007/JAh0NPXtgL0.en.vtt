00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.189
 Equally satisfied we came today 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.830
 Oracle bitter defeats now weekends Woods very much made 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.059
 have easy 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.240
 suffered and suffered for the reason 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.249
 equipped and is so Ramsauer 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.199
 To keep up last days I was already something 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.330
 Quieter a bit subdued but rather larger the proxy on the players 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.560
 so important, we really believe that, and ultimately win 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.270
 our flour can put a small exclamation point 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.389
 to look for the not all the teams here and they showed us that too 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.229
 that we can play really hard at home 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.849
 hard to beat 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.909
 Capone certainly not a team to try on the the smallest game 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.210
 to come and run fast play yourself make 9 4 points 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.340
 that has largely been taken away and thereby one has 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.689
 seen that planks actually 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:23.789
 then closed or rhythm came 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.629
 and 3 the last 15 minutes were very clear because keep buying something 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.449
 you have been beaten for it 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.960
 yes i am meanwhile Â«Sorry a game and commercial thought thank you that is 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.909
 Although certainly Euro and people and problem but already 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.249
 extensive 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.889
 a lager wants to say a lot so i believe 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.749
 meanwhile, if I understood what role I play, I function well 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.629
 for the crew in Cali at no more 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.270
 help provided that for that we take profits that he is part of it 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.219
 contributes 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.450
 under the 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.729
 According to Bernd lead a team 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.460
 that's the way it works best 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.160
 the corporation must go to it now mute double digit Llosa games ahead of us 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.750
 it's about affects production for the clergy from my point of view now percent 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.099
 van der Kamp unfairly accumulates that all our very focused screws in 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.090
 Seoul Stansted come
