designed the griptilian initially with
with<00:00:30.060> bench<00:00:30.300> made<00:00:31.279> this<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.520> has<00:00:33.180> been<00:00:34.040> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
with bench made this one has been this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
with bench made this one has been this
is<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.310> one<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.670> ritter<00:00:36.329> style<00:00:36.870> blade

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is the one with the ritter style blade

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
is the one with the ritter style blade
on<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.560> so<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.460> Doug<00:00:38.790> Ritter's<00:00:39.090> blade

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
on it so it's got Doug Ritter's blade

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.910 
on it so it's got Doug Ritter's blade
design<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.060> s30v<00:00:42.480> steel<00:00:42.990> which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
design and and the s30v steel which

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
design and and the s30v steel which
which<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.060> mel<00:00:45.240> Pardew's<00:00:45.600> ones<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
which the mel Pardew's ones have the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.330 
which the mel Pardew's ones have the
154cm<00:00:47.220> generally<00:00:48.180> speaking<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
154cm generally speaking so this one

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.070 
154cm generally speaking so this one
doesn't<00:00:53.340> actually<00:00:53.490> have<00:00:53.850> any<00:00:53.880> male<00:00:54.570> party<00:00:54.930> win

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
doesn't actually have any male party win

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.040 
doesn't actually have any male party win
it<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.770> got<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.640> bug<00:00:56.820> ritter<00:00:57.060> blade

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
it because it's got the bug ritter blade

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.890 
it because it's got the bug ritter blade
and<00:00:58.380> it's<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.740> a<00:00:58.770> Kevin<00:00:59.760> Wilkins<00:01:00.030> handle<00:01:00.720> so

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
and it's got a Kevin Wilkins handle so

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.270 
and it's got a Kevin Wilkins handle so
this<00:01:01.080> is<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.550> Kevin<00:01:02.550> Wilkins<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
this is really Kevin Wilkins and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.999 
this is really Kevin Wilkins and
decorator<00:01:05.280> together<00:01:06.210> even<00:01:06.810> though<00:01:07.009> Doug

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
decorator together even though Doug

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.680 
decorator together even though Doug
didn't<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.550> know<00:01:09.000> anything<00:01:09.210> about<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
didn't really know anything about that

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.960 
didn't really know anything about that
that<00:01:10.380> collaboration<00:01:10.920> has<00:01:11.100> Kevin<00:01:11.730> did<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that collaboration has Kevin did it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.080 
that collaboration has Kevin did it
afterwards<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.790> course<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
afterwards so and the of course the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.010 
afterwards so and the of course the
access<00:01:15.360> lock<00:01:15.510> designed<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:16.020> McHenry<00:01:16.470> Williams

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
access lock designed by McHenry Williams

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.660 
access lock designed by McHenry Williams
so<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.350> interesting<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.310> an<00:01:20.430> interesting

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
so it's interesting it's an interesting

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.520 
so it's interesting it's an interesting
thing<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.380> handles<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:22.890> really

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
thing because the the handles I really

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.899 
thing because the the handles I really
have<00:01:25.530> nothing<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> original

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
have nothing to do with the original

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.399 
have nothing to do with the original
design<00:01:27.450> these<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.780> completely<00:01:28.380> different

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
design these are completely different

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.840 
design these are completely different
one<00:01:31.409> thing<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.710> noticed<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.640> knife

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
one thing I noticed about the knife

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.180 
one thing I noticed about the knife
right<00:01:33.150> away<00:01:33.510> was<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.260> handles<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.950> very

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
right away was that the handles are very

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.940 
right away was that the handles are very
thick<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> blade<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.810> thin<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
thick and the blade is very thin and it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.320 
thick and the blade is very thin and it
was<00:01:38.100> kind<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> threw<00:01:38.670> me<00:01:38.700> off<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.940> little<00:01:39.180> bit

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
was kind of threw me off a little bit

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.780 
was kind of threw me off a little bit
because<00:01:39.540> while<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.440> love<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.190> feel<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> these

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because while I love the feel of these

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120 
because while I love the feel of these
handles<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.450> love<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.350> dimpling<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
handles and I love the the dimpling that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
handles and I love the the dimpling that
golf<00:01:44.370> ball<00:01:44.430> dimpling<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.510> then<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
golf ball dimpling there and then and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.010 
golf ball dimpling there and then and
everything<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:48.270> still<00:01:48.690> feels<00:01:48.900> like

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
everything it's a it still feels like

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
everything it's a it still feels like
you<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.530> big<00:01:49.830> chunk<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.520> hand<00:01:50.760> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you got this big chunk on your hand and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.520 
you got this big chunk on your hand and
you<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.299> little<00:01:51.510> building<00:01:51.960> paper<00:01:52.260> thin

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you have this little building paper thin

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
you have this little building paper thin
blade<00:01:52.710> coming<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.130> paper<00:01:53.340> thin<00:01:53.580> but<00:01:53.760> thinner

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
blade coming out paper thin but thinner

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
blade coming out paper thin but thinner
than<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.220> I'd<00:01:56.369> expect<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
than then then what I'd expect for a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.390 
than then then what I'd expect for a
handle<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.140> thick<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.729> bit<00:02:01.280> maybe<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
handle is thick so a little bit maybe I

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.859 
handle is thick so a little bit maybe I
would<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.580> preferred<00:02:02.850> thinner<00:02:03.270> handles<00:02:03.720> but

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
would have preferred thinner handles but

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.109 
would have preferred thinner handles but
I'm<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.320> sure<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.070> original<00:02:05.460> handles

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I'm not sure if the original handles

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.770 
I'm not sure if the original handles
were<00:02:06.240> thicker<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.650> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
were thicker this is this is a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
were thicker this is this is a
secondhand<00:02:09.780> purchase<00:02:10.229> knife<00:02:10.439> with<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.340> puck

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
secondhand purchase knife with the puck

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.160 
secondhand purchase knife with the puck
clip<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> left<00:02:12.390> hand<00:02:12.540> side<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.900> suppose

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
clip on the left hand side and suppose

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.660 
clip on the left hand side and suppose
the<00:02:13.349> right<00:02:13.500> hand<00:02:13.709> side<00:02:13.770> which<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:14.160> used<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.459> so

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the right hand side which I'm used to so

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.970 
the right hand side which I'm used to so
it's<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.940> little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.150> awkward

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it's a little bit awkward

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.149 
it's a little bit awkward
so<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.810> holes<00:02:18.959> are<00:02:19.110> maintained<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.920> can

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
so the holes are maintained so this can

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.210 
so the holes are maintained so this can
be<00:02:20.190> mounted<00:02:20.489> both<00:02:21.830> right-handed<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
be mounted both right-handed and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.410 
be mounted both right-handed and
left-handed<00:02:23.480> mom<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:25.470> got<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.860> big<00:02:26.420> chunk

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
left-handed mom it's got this big chunk

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.360 
left-handed mom it's got this big chunk
here<00:02:27.629> in<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> back<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.500> big<00:02:31.530> back<00:02:31.920> spacer

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
here in the back so the big back spacer

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
here in the back so the big back spacer
here<00:02:32.400> I'm<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.150> sure<00:02:33.209> why<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.690> sticks<00:02:34.049> out<00:02:34.200> like

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
here I'm not sure why it sticks out like

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920 
here I'm not sure why it sticks out like
this<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.709> never<00:02:34.920> looked<00:02:35.640> into<00:02:35.879> Kevin<00:02:36.750> Wilkins

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
this I never looked into Kevin Wilkins

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.869

rationale<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.620> designing<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.430> us<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.760> that

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
rationale for designing of us like that

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.820 
rationale for designing of us like that
way<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.239> probably<00:02:40.140> would<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.470> preferred<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
way I probably would have preferred the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.770 
way I probably would have preferred the
look<00:02:41.069> of<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.340> sitting<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> inside<00:02:42.299> but<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
look of it sitting on the inside but it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.330 
look of it sitting on the inside but it
does<00:02:42.989> have<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> nice<00:02:43.379> feel<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.890> sticking<00:02:44.160> out

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
does have a nice feel to it sticking out

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.970 
does have a nice feel to it sticking out
that's<00:02:44.879> kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> neat<00:02:45.650> gives<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.860> little

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
that's kind of neat gives it a little

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.330 
that's kind of neat gives it a little
bitty<00:02:47.510> sort<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.620> unique<00:02:49.620> character<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
bitty sort of unique character to it

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.789 
bitty sort of unique character to it
that<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> don't<00:02:50.940> always<00:02:51.150> see<00:02:51.319> nice<00:02:52.319> color<00:02:52.680> on

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
that you don't always see nice color on

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.110 
that you don't always see nice color on
the<00:02:53.010> handles<00:02:53.340> cause<00:02:53.519> they're<00:02:53.670> sort<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the handles cause they're sort of a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.740 
the handles cause they're sort of a
yellowish<00:02:54.959> green<00:02:55.260> chartreuse<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:56.609> like<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.510> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
yellowish green chartreuse I like that I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.979 
yellowish green chartreuse I like that I
love<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> feel<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.670> dimpling<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.390> it's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
love the feel of the dimpling on it it's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.470 
love the feel of the dimpling on it it's
nice<00:03:01.370> access<00:03:02.370> lock<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.760> course<00:03:03.000> from<00:03:03.239> ends

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
nice access lock of course from ends

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160 
nice access lock of course from ends
meet<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:05.280> too<00:03:05.430> much<00:03:05.549> waffle<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.269> little<00:03:07.019> bit

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
meet not too much waffle a little bit

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.449 
meet not too much waffle a little bit
pride<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> little<00:03:07.650> bit<00:03:07.890> loose<00:03:08.069> on<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.310> pivot

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
pride a little bit loose on the pivot

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.640 
pride a little bit loose on the pivot
here<00:03:08.700> could<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:08.940> tightened<00:03:09.390> that's<00:03:10.260> locks

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
here could be tightened that's locks

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.710 
here could be tightened that's locks
typically<00:03:11.069> do<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.459> some<00:03:11.910> blade<00:03:12.269> play<00:03:12.569> of

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
typically do you have some blade play of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.170 
typically do you have some blade play of
them<00:03:12.900> when<00:03:13.079> closed<00:03:13.549> nothing<00:03:14.549> nothing<00:03:14.879> that

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
them when closed nothing nothing that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.250 
them when closed nothing nothing that
you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.359> feel<00:03:15.510> when<00:03:15.629> they're<00:03:15.720> opened<00:03:16.109> a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
you can feel when they're opened a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.330 
you can feel when they're opened a
little<00:03:16.709> bit<00:03:16.890> closed<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:18.140> there<00:03:19.310> there<00:03:20.310> there

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
little bit closed but there there there

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.400 
little bit closed but there there there
I<00:03:20.879> think<00:03:21.269> they're<00:03:21.389> perfectly<00:03:21.750> acceptable<00:03:22.260> I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
I think they're perfectly acceptable I

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.129 
I think they're perfectly acceptable I
mean<00:03:22.970> benchmade<00:03:23.970> does<00:03:24.180> pretty<00:03:24.540> decent<00:03:24.930> stuff

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
mean benchmade does pretty decent stuff

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.199 
mean benchmade does pretty decent stuff
so<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:26.040> blade<00:03:26.250> play<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.579> usually<00:03:26.970> fairly

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
so the blade play is usually fairly

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.000 
so the blade play is usually fairly
minimal<00:03:28.069> but<00:03:29.069> there<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.310> some<00:03:30.680> what<00:03:31.680> else<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
minimal but there is some what else to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.490 
minimal but there is some what else to
say<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.400> about<00:03:32.639> this<00:03:33.230> Miss<00:03:34.230> Ritter<00:03:36.290> yeah<00:03:37.290> so

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
say here about this Miss Ritter yeah so

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.110 
say here about this Miss Ritter yeah so
if<00:03:37.590> you're<00:03:37.739> familiar<00:03:37.829> with<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> design<00:03:38.669> on<00:03:38.700> on

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
if you're familiar with the design on on

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.949 
if you're familiar with the design on on

on the the other griptilian 'he's this
this<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.680> slightly<00:03:43.950> different<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.669> was

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
this one is slightly different and was

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.390 
this one is slightly different and was
designed<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.870> conjunction<00:03:46.019> with<00:03:46.349> with<00:03:47.160> Doug

designed in conjunction with with Doug

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.900 
designed in conjunction with with Doug
Ritter<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.160> probably<00:03:50.609> read<00:03:50.760> all
