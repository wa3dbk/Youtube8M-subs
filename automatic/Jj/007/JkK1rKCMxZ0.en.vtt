00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
that's what it was it was my appendix

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.559 
that's what it was it was my appendix
had<00:02:47.959> broken<00:02:48.170> clear<00:02:48.590> off<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.329> floated<00:02:50.329> up

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
had broken clear off and floated up

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.710 
had broken clear off and floated up
against<00:02:50.900> my<00:02:50.989> diaphragm<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:53.180> walled<00:02:53.450> off

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
against my diaphragm and it walled off

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.490 
against my diaphragm and it walled off
up<00:02:53.989> there<00:02:55.239> but<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.540> had<00:02:56.689> peritonitis<00:02:57.140> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
up there but I had peritonitis and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.399 
up there but I had peritonitis and
gangrene<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.159> everything<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.900> I<00:02:59.930> basically

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
gangrene and everything so I basically

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.899 
gangrene and everything so I basically
should<00:03:00.799> have<00:03:00.920> died<00:03:01.069> in<00:03:01.280> fact<00:03:01.459> when<00:03:01.609> they<00:03:01.700> sent

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
should have died in fact when they sent

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.869 
should have died in fact when they sent
me<00:03:02.000> home<00:03:02.120> after<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> week<00:03:03.280> they<00:03:04.280> literally<00:03:04.609> send

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
me home after a week they literally send

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.539

me<00:03:04.970> home<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.269> die<00:03:05.299> because<00:03:06.099> no<00:03:07.099> one<00:03:07.280> has<00:03:07.430> ever

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
me home to die because no one has ever

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.690 
me home to die because no one has ever
lived<00:03:07.790> through<00:03:07.879> that<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:10.430> then<00:03:10.549> you

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
lived through that is it but then you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.119

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
started having you were thinking yeah

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.619 
started having you were thinking yeah
what<00:03:13.370> about<00:03:13.519> in<00:03:13.639> your<00:03:13.670> life<00:03:13.849> at<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.269> point

what about in your life at that point

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.660 
what about in your life at that point
right<00:03:14.959> went<00:03:15.170> out<00:03:15.470> when<00:03:16.159> I<00:03:16.250> was<00:03:16.340> laying<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.609> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
right went out when I was laying in the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.830 
right went out when I was laying in the
hospital<00:03:16.790> bed<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.359> could<00:03:17.480> hear<00:03:17.629> them<00:03:17.720> out<00:03:17.810> there

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
hospital bed I could hear them out there

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.569 
hospital bed I could hear them out there
talking<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.440> basically<00:03:19.220> trying<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.489> figure

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
talking and basically trying to figure

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.929 
talking and basically trying to figure
out<00:03:19.819> much<00:03:20.000> longer<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.329> was<00:03:20.540> gonna<00:03:20.900> live<00:03:21.939> and

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
out much longer I was gonna live and

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.670 
out much longer I was gonna live and
what<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.269> odds<00:03:23.389> are<00:03:23.569> of<00:03:23.659> me<00:03:23.840> making<00:03:24.409> it<00:03:24.530> and

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
what the odds are of me making it and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.240 
what the odds are of me making it and
and<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.459> started<00:03:25.730> thinking<00:03:25.970> about<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.950> things

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and I started thinking about the things

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250 
and I started thinking about the things
the<00:03:28.939> things<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.359> bothered<00:03:29.689> me<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.810> most<00:03:29.930> was

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
the things that bothered me the most was

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.420 
the things that bothered me the most was
the<00:03:30.379> fact<00:03:30.409> that<00:03:30.650> never<00:03:30.980> should<00:03:31.159> were<00:03:31.250> number

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the fact that never should were number

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.410 
the fact that never should were number
one<00:03:31.609> would<00:03:32.540> never<00:03:32.720> see<00:03:32.870> my<00:03:32.989> kids<00:03:33.230> raised<00:03:34.420> and

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
number two I wouldn't fulfill a life

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
painter because I'm still painting

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.839 
painter because I'm still painting
science<00:03:44.449> and<00:03:45.129> always<00:03:46.129> wanted<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.459> quit<00:03:46.669> and<00:03:46.699> I

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
science and always wanted to quit and I

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.890 
science and always wanted to quit and I
saved<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.389> like<00:03:47.720> close<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.370> $4,000

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
saved up like close to $4,000

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.270 
saved up like close to $4,000
$3,500<00:03:50.900> something<00:03:51.169> like<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.409> to<00:03:51.949> quit<00:03:52.129> my

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
$3,500 something like that to quit my

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.520 
$3,500 something like that to quit my
job<00:03:52.310> with<00:03:52.699> but<00:03:52.909> once<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.780> got<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.139> that<00:03:54.290> goal

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
job with but once I got to that goal

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.229 
job with but once I got to that goal
then<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.370> didn't<00:03:55.609> quite<00:03:55.760> have<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:55.940> nerve<00:03:56.209> to

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
then I didn't quite have the nerve to

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.189 
then I didn't quite have the nerve to
quit<00:03:56.919> and<00:03:57.919> so<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.819> have<00:03:59.690> been<00:03:59.720> dealing<00:04:00.169> with

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
quit and so I have been dealing with

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.500 
quit and so I have been dealing with
that<00:04:00.379> for<00:04:00.440> about<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.769> year<00:04:01.159> knowing<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.329> should

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
that for about a year knowing I should

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.899 
that for about a year knowing I should
go<00:04:02.599> in<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.810> quit<00:04:02.989> get<00:04:03.290> started<00:04:03.709> but<00:04:04.579> I<00:04:04.609> didn't

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
go in and quit get started but I didn't

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.860 
go in and quit get started but I didn't
do<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.150> now<00:04:05.299> I'd<00:04:05.449> waited<00:04:05.659> too<00:04:05.930> long<00:04:06.819> so<00:04:07.819> that

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
do it now I'd waited too long so that

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.020 
do it now I'd waited too long so that
those<00:04:08.870> things<00:04:09.250> three<00:04:10.250> things<00:04:10.489> bothered<00:04:10.879> me

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
those things three things bothered me

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.530 
those things three things bothered me
and<00:04:11.260> after<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> got<00:04:12.919> better<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:13.970> made<00:04:14.389> it

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
and after I got better and made it
