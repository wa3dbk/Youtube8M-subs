00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
completely maxed out well we've done a

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.179 
completely maxed out well we've done a
lot<00:01:45.939> of<00:01:45.970> optimization<00:01:46.720> on<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.900> engine<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.890> try

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
lot of optimization on the engine to try

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.800 
lot of optimization on the engine to try
and<00:01:48.369> make<00:01:48.460> sure<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.700> it's<00:01:48.970> playable<00:01:49.270> on<00:01:49.570> lots

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
and make sure that it's playable on lots

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.350 
and make sure that it's playable on lots
of<00:01:49.930> different<00:01:50.020> specs<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.500> machines<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.790> if<00:01:52.150> you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
of different specs of machines so if you

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.060 
of different specs of machines so if you
want<00:01:52.750> have<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> lower<00:01:53.260> end<00:01:53.470> machine<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> couple

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
want have a lower end machine a couple

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.380 
want have a lower end machine a couple
years<00:01:54.189> old<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.520> can<00:01:54.640> actually<00:01:54.880> still<00:01:55.090> play<00:01:55.270> on

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
years old you can actually still play on

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.940 
years old you can actually still play on
some<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.689> lower<00:01:55.840> settings<00:01:56.260> it's<00:01:56.710> not

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
some of the lower settings it's not

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.039 
some of the lower settings it's not
critical<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.939> gameplay<00:01:58.240> aspect<00:01:58.960> that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
as well next question i have is a how

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.199 
as well next question i have is a how
long<00:02:41.830> was<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.280> development<00:02:42.700> cycle<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:43.120> this

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
long was the development cycle for this

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.840 
long was the development cycle for this
game<00:02:43.360> development<00:02:44.200> cycle<00:02:44.590> was<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:45.520> over<00:02:45.700> two

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
game development cycle was just over two

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.610 
game development cycle was just over two
years<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.330> us<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.690> went<00:02:47.050> through<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> concept

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
years for us we went through a concept

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.260 
years for us we went through a concept
phase<00:02:47.860> pre-production<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:49.000> went<00:02:49.180> into

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
phase pre-production and then went into

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.620 
phase pre-production and then went into
production<00:02:49.950> when<00:02:50.950> THQ<00:02:51.540> handed<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.600> reins

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
production when THQ handed the reins

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.510 
production when THQ handed the reins
over<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.959> sega<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.500> were<00:02:53.650> granted<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.100> small

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
over to sega we were granted a small

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.650 
over to sega we were granted a small
extension<00:02:54.790> which<00:02:55.030> we're<00:02:55.209> really<00:02:55.390> pleased

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
extension which we're really pleased

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.760 
extension which we're really pleased
about<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.989> we've<00:02:56.140> had<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> little<00:02:56.470> bit<00:02:56.680> longer

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
about so we've had a little bit longer

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.410 
about so we've had a little bit longer
than<00:02:57.040> we<00:02:57.100> originally<00:02:57.220> anticipated<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.330> we

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
than we originally anticipated and we

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.940 
than we originally anticipated and we
took<00:02:58.570> all<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.050> extra<00:02:59.350> time<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.770> put<00:02:59.920> it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
took all that extra time and we put it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.800 
took all that extra time and we put it
back<00:03:00.130> into<00:03:00.310> polishing<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.300> experience
