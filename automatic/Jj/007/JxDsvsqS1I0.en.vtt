00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 organize another crossover this program 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.130
 where I pick up two characters or two 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.320
 groups of characters and put it to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 fight and last episode was batman 10 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 if you lost you can click here or here 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
 or description 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.810
 today psb I need to talk to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.279
 you quickly get some warnings from some 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.230
 It's very cool that I had for this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 this crossover who decides the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 winner of the struggles you are not me 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.769
 right after every episode you go there 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 in our forum and you put your text 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.020
 Who do you think you get in the crossover? 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 and there is always the best text wins some 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.059
 But I have a very cool idea. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.040
 also to add that is beyond you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 to win something a graphic novel 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
 but here is something like a draw 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 I need your text better, I'll go 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.590
 use to create 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.969
 I'll use it script to create a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 comics video I use the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.440
 your text as a script is a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
 illustrator I already talked to him 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.660
 to do illustration and I do the editing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.150
 game on youtube with credits to you 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.350
 which made the text concerned is its text 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.210
 illustrated as if it were a story in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 comics iran in the nexxera video delayed 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 to release new episodes solve 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 now waiting for the illustrator's response 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 and he said that he is studying with the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 public now he can not even catch 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.890
 this work, but they are the proof of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.740
 he will be able to make the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.090
 illustrations and not to leave much time 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 without the crossover, right? 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.600
 I stop making the new episodes 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 even as soon as he can make the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.439
 The illustrations we start to do here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.240
 also that you found the idea let 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.340
 in the comments to know where past 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.299
 debate with verses Iron man is this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.040
 on here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.229
 batman that happened to the knight of the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 darkness was drawn the winner was already 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.509
 in our forum 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.130
 I already put it in the post if you want 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.320
 to know if you are the winner 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.799
 It's down here, and this time it will not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 New graphic draw denies that because 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.090
 these boundaries are expensive and this time 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.340
 It's not working. 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.750
 Mask participate anyway this 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.909
 text there forum because its history 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 It could turn into a comic. 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.530
 road that will be here on r7 at 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.810
 video format gomes crossed and let's go 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.179
 put two of the greatest archers of the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.300
 fiction by making clear leagues 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.810
 miles and miles and miles to get back and right 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.610
 see who is the best way said 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.650
 besides the side of bsi comics we have the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.209
 green archer and the marvel side we have 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.860
 place of a file we will present 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.440
 first hero of dc comics 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 the oil is bad or the green archer was 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.569
 created by george papi and death whiting 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.580
 in 1941 in the magazine more fantÃ´mas number 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.200
 73 which is a batman mix with the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.239
 barein prince knows of flash gordon 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.830
 but the creators said that the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.750
 inspiration was in hollywood in his 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.940
 Origin A Shame A Millionaire Type 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.980
 industrial playboy and one night 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.230
 while he was drunk he fell from a 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.739
 his yacht wrecked on an island 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.150
 deserted 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.100
 there he improvised a bow and arrow to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.470
 able to hunt and feed and left the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.940
 island when a group of bandits 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.830
 embarked on it if bandits used 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.420
 island as a hideout and oliver klein 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.950
 caught off guard 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.430
 Coast this time he spent in 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.650
 island 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.780
 he realized what it's like to live without comfort 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.440
 of civilization and when he returned to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.510
 the city 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250
 I look really bad I decided to spend the hours 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.440
 places to fight crime as the archer 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.299
 green already the clint barton or the hawk 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.599
 archer a very tragic story as 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.280
 some heroes in normally their parents 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.989
 died during a trip with a 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.340
 car accident and a small client 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.600
 was sent to an orphanage 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.250
 he started to develop many 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.500
 problems with relationships and 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.060
 problems with authorities as well and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.530
 ended up running away from the orphanage and 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.630
 integrating a circus group where 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.220
 trained by sporting and trio 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.049
 shock wandered the world gaining 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.970
 life in presentations with archery 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.620
 and juggling until one day he 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.130
 witnessed the iron man saving 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.019
 people of bandits and decided that 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.880
 would become a crime fighter only 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.250
 that in his first heroic act he went 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.410
 confused with bandits and the black widow 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.910
 saved his life and recruited him to 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.130
 fight an iron man like 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.500
 villain so he started as a villain but 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.639
 that changed until he became a superhero 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.739
 let's say the two are similar in 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.840
 almost everything the guy came from the personality 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.730
 theirs is very hard head very much 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.650
 stressed very impatiently that the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.579
 combat techniques that the two use 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.859
 arrows 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.530
 each one has its arrow style to 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.630
 explosive flashes by 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.750
 x-ray of ice praxe praxe of fire 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.639

 black canary negro and fia are also 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.319
 two very similar characters the two 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.639
 have a romantic affair 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:29.710

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.590
 super heroes of every publisher the archer 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.960

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.490
 in the players but some take advantages 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.979
 in some things like the green quartet 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.900

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.389
