can<00:02:32.940> also<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.450> type<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.080> utilizing<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
can also just type it in utilizing the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.840 
can also just type it in utilizing the
keyboard<00:02:35.550> here<00:02:35.819> as<00:02:35.940> well<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.489> easier

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
keyboard here as well it's just easier

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.030 
keyboard here as well it's just easier
for<00:02:38.880> me<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> use<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.600> keypad<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.470> point<00:02:40.860> nine

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
for me to use this keypad so point nine

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.970 
for me to use this keypad so point nine
zero<00:02:41.069> for<00:02:41.670> cat<00:02:41.850> five<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.510> 5e<00:02:43.550> for<00:02:44.550> cat<00:02:44.790> six<00:02:45.980> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
zero for cat five and 5e for cat six I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.610 
zero for cat five and 5e for cat six I
would<00:02:47.280> suggest<00:02:47.670> doing<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.600> point<00:02:48.989> nine<00:02:49.230> five

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
would suggest doing a point nine five

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.900 
would suggest doing a point nine five
and<00:02:50.070> again<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.660> depending<00:02:52.290> upon<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and again you can depending upon the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.390 
and again you can depending upon the
outside<00:02:54.269> diameter<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.470> cable<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.160> how

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
outside diameter to the cable that's how

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.309 
outside diameter to the cable that's how
you<00:02:56.489> adjust<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.239> particular<00:02:57.600> length<00:02:58.050> so

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
you adjust this particular length so

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.870 
you adjust this particular length so
let's<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.650> ahead<00:02:58.769> must<00:02:59.220> leave<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> point

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
let's go ahead must leave it a point

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.150 
let's go ahead must leave it a point

in 12 I'm going to hit the ok button now
because<00:04:12.750> we're<00:04:13.019> changing<00:04:13.049> two<00:04:13.769> digits<00:04:14.310> here

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
because we're changing two digits here

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.509 
because we're changing two digits here
that<00:04:15.630> zero<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.590> I'm<00:04:16.709> going<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.979> left<00:04:17.220> arrow

that zero and I'm going to left arrow

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.779 
that zero and I'm going to left arrow
over<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:19.320> highlight<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.859> zero<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.190> zero<00:04:20.459> is

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
over to highlight the zero the zero is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.470 
over to highlight the zero the zero is
going<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> eventually<00:04:21.419> become<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:22.019> one

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.430 

and<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:25.020> one<00:04:25.280> over<00:04:26.280> here<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.780> eventually

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
and the one over here is eventually

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.810 
and the one over here is eventually
going<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.650> become<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.980> two<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:29.460> we're<00:04:29.580> changing

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
going to become a two so we're changing

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.220 
going to become a two so we're changing
two<00:04:30.240> digits<00:04:30.720> here<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.740> I'm<00:04:32.640> going<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.910> hit<00:04:33.230> the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
two digits here so I'm going to hit the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.100 
two digits here so I'm going to hit the
enter<00:04:34.410> button<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:35.220> start<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.790> zero<00:04:36.110> and
