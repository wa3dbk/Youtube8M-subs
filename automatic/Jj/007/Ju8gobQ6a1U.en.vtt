00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.820
 again, all right, good rub the road 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.650
 until a homogeneous mass that's growing again, 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.460
 homogeneous mass and now by a little bit 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.449
 add flour and everything is fine again 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.290

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.790
 I can for a little bit all 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.010
 Immediately here now add our dough 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.320
 baking powder mixed with flour so she 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.240
 probably everything was distributed and again 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.060
 very well we knead everything 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.920
 Here is a very soft, obedient dough 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.970
 it turns out take this on the fault 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.220
 breaks very easily 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.110
 Now we bring down the lump in probes 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.590
 we put in a bag and send it to 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.380
 30 minutes for 30 minutes 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.460
 our dough stood in the fridge I 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.830
 I got one piece of dough I'm small 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.439
 put it away because it will be us 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.850
 then on the groove and the pack and baking I 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.830
 covered with foil 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.470
 smeared with butter and sprinkled 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.810
 a little bit could but then 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.040
 to make it easier to remove the cake itself now 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.930
 we will do this kind of manipulation we 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 This dough will lay out like this 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.320
 do not be afraid of the pieces straight like this 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.350
 fold out 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.190
 and start sculpt form here 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.800
 butterflies 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.690
 I fashioned but the butterfly and from all over 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.150
 main dough and now left here 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.540
 a piece of a small now to him I natra on 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.890
 a large grater on the edges of our butterflies need 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.200
 sure to make such little ones 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.150
 bumpers so that a little bit of dough rises 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.910
 and now here we will be neatly 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.130
 spread dzhen and thin so here 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.200
 spread across the surface i 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.150
 smeared all the jam and here I was 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.250
 Lemon such slices I wanted 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
 you can add too 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.220
 experiment now with this 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.440
 dough that we rub will do 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.020
 completely different drawings to create or 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.730
 that this is really a butterfly like this 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.080
 Here now looks our butterfly and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.680
 In this form, I send in the warmed 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.870
 oven to 170 degrees and she will be so 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.780
 not less than 30 minutes to good good 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.269
 tanned well that's got our butterfly from 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.300
 ovens in this form and so we will leave 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.220
 cool completely so handsome with us 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.110

 homemade tea cake
