the place where they're bending their
arms<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> makes<00:01:10.890> sense<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.850> happens<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
arms that makes sense so what happens is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
arms that makes sense so what happens is
that<00:01:12.750> puts<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> strain<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.310> also

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that puts a lot of strain on here also

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
that puts a lot of strain on here also
if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> put<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> thumb<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.500> muscles

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
if you put the thumb up here the muscles

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.609 
if you put the thumb up here the muscles
become<00:01:17.820> tight<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> elbow<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> loose

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
become tight here on the elbow and loose

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
become tight here on the elbow and loose
here<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> wrist<00:01:20.250> okay<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> wrist<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
here on the wrist okay the wrist is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.890 
here on the wrist okay the wrist is
built<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.799> flexible<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> move<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
built to be flexible and move like that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.929 
built to be flexible and move like that
whereas<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> elbow<00:01:25.890> isn't<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.670> why

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
whereas the elbow isn't so that's why

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.330 
whereas the elbow isn't so that's why
you<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.570> tennis<00:01:27.930> elbow<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> ask

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you get tennis elbow now when you ask

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
you get tennis elbow now when you ask
people<00:01:29.880> why<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.450> put<00:01:30.780> their<00:01:31.079> thumb<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.380> here

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
people why they put their thumb up here

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
people why they put their thumb up here
on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> backhand<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.729> reason<00:01:33.240> they<00:01:33.329> say<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
on the backhand the reason they say is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
on the backhand the reason they say is
it<00:01:33.750> gives<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> little<00:01:34.320> bit<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.619> stability

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it gives me a little bit more stability

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.370 
it gives me a little bit more stability
kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> gives<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> good<00:01:36.090> backing<00:01:36.420> okay<00:01:37.229> but

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
kind of gives me a good backing okay but

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.899 
kind of gives me a good backing okay but
this<00:01:37.530> actually<00:01:37.770> isn't<00:01:38.130> true<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.759> what

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
this actually isn't true see what

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.359 
this actually isn't true see what
happens<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.570> let's<00:01:40.229> say<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> ball<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> coming<00:01:41.250> in

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
happens is let's say a ball is coming in

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.399 
happens is let's say a ball is coming in
here<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> let's<00:01:42.299> say<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> hits<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:43.140> here

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
here and let's say it hits it right here

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
here and let's say it hits it right here
on<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.009> bottom<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.549> doesn't<00:01:44.790> hit<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
on the bottom it doesn't hit it in the
