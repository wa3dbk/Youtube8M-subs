Archer<00:01:39.229> really<00:01:39.740> can't<00:01:39.979> remember<00:01:40.369> things<00:01:40.550> but

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
Archer really can't remember things but

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.600 
Archer really can't remember things but
then<00:01:41.210> again<00:01:41.330> even<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.619> anybody<00:01:43.070> would<00:01:43.399> want

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610

then again even so anybody would want
the<00:01:43.729> Grail<00:01:43.940> so<00:01:44.210> why<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.020> he<00:01:45.380> has<00:01:45.860> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the Grail so why is it that he has a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.590 
the Grail so why is it that he has a
grudge<00:01:46.280> or<00:01:46.580> not<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> grudge<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:47.450> he's

grudge or not a grudge but he's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.779 
grudge or not a grudge but he's

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.530 
wicked bitch and we have Archer saving
him<00:04:22.720> as<00:04:22.840> well<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.260> Archer<00:04:23.950> it's<00:04:24.190> like<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.940> think

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
him as well so Archer it's like I think

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.480 
him as well so Archer it's like I think
he's<00:04:25.780> going<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.410> extent<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.979> lot<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.400> it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
he's going to this extent a lot of it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.580 
he's going to this extent a lot of it
has<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.669> do<00:04:27.940> for<00:04:27.970> Rin<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.600> think<00:04:28.930> he<00:04:29.080> respects

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
has to do for Rin I think he respects

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.500 
has to do for Rin I think he respects
Rin<00:04:29.830> enough<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.340> he<00:04:30.580> likes<00:04:30.820> when<00:04:30.910> enough<00:04:31.300> that

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
Rin enough and he likes when enough that

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.120 
Rin enough and he likes when enough that
he'll<00:04:31.870> do<00:04:32.110> these<00:04:32.320> things<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.710> trying<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:33.010> help

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
he'll do these things and trying to help

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.830 
he'll do these things and trying to help
out<00:04:33.370> Shiro<00:04:33.940> whatever<00:04:34.330> because<00:04:34.630> he<00:04:34.690> doesn't

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
out Shiro whatever because he doesn't

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.270 
out Shiro whatever because he doesn't
wanna<00:04:35.020> make<00:04:35.050> her<00:04:35.290> sad<00:04:35.500> probably<00:04:36.100> and

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
wanna make her sad probably and

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.280 
wanna make her sad probably and
ultimately<00:04:36.880> he<00:04:37.120> does<00:04:37.330> respect<00:04:37.750> her<00:04:37.930> so<00:04:37.960> that's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
ultimately he does respect her so that's

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.100 
ultimately he does respect her so that's
probably<00:04:38.560> why<00:04:38.950> he<00:04:39.220> came<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.910> save<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.360> day<00:04:40.570> so

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
probably why he came to save the day so

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.650 
probably why he came to save the day so
it's<00:04:41.410> like<00:04:41.470> it's<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.800> weird<00:04:42.240> personality<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.570> a

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
it's like it's a weird personality in a

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.330 
it's like it's a weird personality in a
weird<00:04:43.900> situation<00:04:44.080> with<00:04:44.650> him<00:04:44.800> because<00:04:45.070> it's

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
weird situation with him because it's

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.520 
weird situation with him because it's
like<00:04:45.460> he<00:04:46.030> even<00:04:46.270> dealt<00:04:46.720> doesn't<00:04:47.020> lecture<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
like he even dealt doesn't lecture and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.200 
like he even dealt doesn't lecture and
he<00:04:47.620> wants<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.919> knock<00:04:48.130> them<00:04:48.250> off<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.669> if<00:04:48.820> that

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
he wants to knock them off and if that

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.820 
he wants to knock them off and if that
was<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.419> case<00:04:49.450> perfect<00:04:50.110> opportunity<00:04:50.440> just

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
was the case perfect opportunity just

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.710 
was the case perfect opportunity just
like<00:04:50.890> castor<00:04:51.340> do<00:04:51.460> whatever<00:04:51.760> Tim<00:04:52.030> but<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.570> fact

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
like castor do whatever Tim but the fact

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.180 
like castor do whatever Tim but the fact
that<00:04:52.870> he<00:04:52.960> saved<00:04:53.050> them<00:04:53.440> gives<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.950> little<00:04:53.979> bit

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
that he saved them gives a little bit

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.890 
that he saved them gives a little bit
more<00:04:54.400> of<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.580> complexity<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.479> character

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
more of a complexity to the character

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.030 
more of a complexity to the character
and<00:04:56.110> then<00:04:56.229> things<00:04:56.500> start<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.010> little

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
and then things start to get a little

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.159 
and then things start to get a little
bit<00:04:57.370> more<00:04:57.490> interesting<00:04:57.729> as<00:04:58.030> well<00:04:58.240> when<00:04:58.750> sabres

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
bit more interesting as well when sabres

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.690 
bit more interesting as well when sabres
going<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.740> then<00:04:59.979> she<00:05:00.190> gets<00:05:00.220> stopped<00:05:00.580> by

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
going and then she gets stopped by

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.310 
going and then she gets stopped by
assassin<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:01.360> we<00:05:01.450> have<00:05:01.570> another<00:05:01.870> one<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.200> the

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
assassin so we have another one of the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.140 
assassin so we have another one of the
opponents<00:05:02.770> as<00:05:02.860> well<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.250> things<00:05:03.669> are<00:05:03.850> starting

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
opponents as well so things are starting

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.909 
opponents as well so things are starting
to<00:05:04.210> move<00:05:04.360> along<00:05:04.660> again<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.080> lot<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.350> buildup<00:05:05.740> in

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
to move along again a lot of buildup in

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.500 
to move along again a lot of buildup in
this<00:05:06.010> episode<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.550> towards<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.120> end<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.360> lot
