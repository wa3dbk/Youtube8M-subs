00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 you guys are well found by believe 75 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.900
 we are at the long-awaited final of the roundup 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.349
 of the comparative t as you see 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.650
 heat sinks or cooling bases for 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.859
 laptops in this case I think 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 to have reviewed and tested for you 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 all available some products 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.039
 master we start from the last to the first 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 I leave this here because it is beautiful 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.279
 then around 20 euros we have you 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 light it is a product 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.640
 particular modular because it has one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 single fan 80 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.120
 placed here you can pick up and move 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
 at pleasure in practice by entering it e 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 pointing it towards the area that you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 you think it is the hottest one in the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 own notebook then in my case or 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 macbook pro 13 inch I think it is 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.670
 this then once turned 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.350
 here it is with only one cable and plastic 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.860
 a very light material and is suitable 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.810
 for small notebooks 13 14 15 inches lo 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 I put in last position because 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 honestly it is the kind of material not 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.020
 I appreciate it a lot even though the efficiency 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 of the event is undoubted 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.420
 but the fan is not a very loud one 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.189
 it is not adjustable but also a usb hub 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 power supply via usb with 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.820
 this external bridge is possible 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 therefore extending does not actually concern you 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 a photo by 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.470
 let's move on to the second ranked classified 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.659
 which I think is absurd 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.600
 although this is very nice here 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.670
 this is the infinite goes a model of 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.700
 beautiful design definitely beautiful 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.729
 brushed aluminum door 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.530
 usb input 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.360
 here it is fan adjustment which 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.049
 less key elements are available 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 ignition rubber bases to accommodate 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.110
 and make a 14 15 17 stop comfortably 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.520
 inches even if for the seventeen le 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.039
 little little and a triple port that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.679
 you are here a small lend usb hub 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.799
 beautiful comfortable the area arrives from here the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.629
 noise was heard that enough e 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.810
 despite being a beautiful object of 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.120
 design costing around 45 euros between 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.849
 the other would not recommend it for the boulders 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.110
 and performance mainly because I have a 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.319
 stained altitude that you look at yourself 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.060
 how delicate especially because not 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.590
 we can cool these areas here 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.079
 lateral that in some cases and above all 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.049
 for that of the macs where it feeds 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.420
 they can be the most sensitive though 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.190
 definitely it is a living room object if 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 you want a product to always keep in 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.630
 arm or within your reach 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.769
 salottino this is highly recommended 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:52.220
 we go to the next guys in my opinion 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:55.579
 the third classified is the youtube las 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.799
 which remains for the two small fans 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.630
 modular or that can be inserted at will 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.799
 any point of this perforated grid 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.380
 look just press the button 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.380
 to move them this remains the product 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.519
 more versatile assessment looks 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.950
 raw, however, is made of rubber from here 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.650
 you have seen no here I am clumsy I do not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.889
 It's not the fault of the thing 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.170
 it's not the fault of the thing I can do it 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.069
 I'm the song I apologize for sorry 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.290
 I'm not stupid is that they draw me like that 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.840
 then here we have small passers-by 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.160
 for rubber cable a single usb port 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.110
 with a rear loop with one 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 the extension that allows you to do from 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.710
 bridge then connect 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.050
 simultaneously another object e 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.500
 the two little ones will not block our door 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.870
 fans 60mm I believe are 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.660
 quite noisy the flow is not 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.400
 adjustable but do their duty yes 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.890
 can hold on the knees but the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
 lack of a lower platform there 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.950
 makes it a bit uncomfortable despite everything is 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 really efficient is on the 27 28 euros 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.600
 on amazon and it's really a nice one 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.740
 I recommend it to everyone 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.510
 a bit more geeks 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.400
 sincerely the second classified a 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.790
 my opinion 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:20.049
 and this is because it is also my choice 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.070
 in the office this is called ergostand 2 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.080
 and it is practically a base that can be 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.300
 lift to two legs that block the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.230
 computer a cinco the single fan from 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.780
 120 mm moderate noise 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.510
 in any case thanks to the controls put in place 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.880
 on the back side we can turn on and 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.250
 turn off our little object 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.050
 four USB 2.0 ports and adjust the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.090
 pot feeding takes place via 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.930
 micro usb port is also available 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.980
 mini usb or conversely but nothing 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.480
 advantages of these objects because already 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.190
 given the review you know that I 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:01.150
 I can only raise here here 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.370
 here and place my computer so in 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.260
 overhead so you can 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.260
 bring the notebook screen to the 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.310
 equal to that of an external screen 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.640
 excellent cooling base 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.640
 versatile perhaps even more practical for 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.520
 the stand qualities and for the present of a 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.230
 usb 2.0 hub that for the capacity of 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.960
 cooling that is limited because of the 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.030
 limited action fan e 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.620
 slightly noisy e 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.110
 in these points it does not reach the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.860
 perfection let's go to the winner at this 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.230
 costs and I don't remember badly 37 euros on 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.760
 amazon we go to check perfect 36 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.030
 42 hours on amazon 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.520
 now the latest product but in my opinion 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.990
 is the winner is very simple note park 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.310
 it's one 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.280
 I think this is the category 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.230
 basic cooling for more PCs 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.620
 apt 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.090
 in practice a compact block pier that 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.270
 you can easily get on 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.970
 legs because below and is armored on 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.660
 feet to adjust the height as you do 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.000
 does a bit with keyboards and in rubber 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.200
 who hold it still on the table and one 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.320
 single monolithic wind race from 230 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.570
 mm I assure you that this is the 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.970
 maximum in terms of yield efficiency 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.500
 and the fan being very numerous 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.590
 large and can rotate a regime of 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.560
 lower rotation but in the same way 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.140
 however equal noise production 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.420
 a higher air mass with a 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.430
 computer above is very nice does little 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.280
 noise is the most interesting thing to be 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.650
 here comes a very pleasant air flow 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.960
 with which to refresh our hands too 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.960
 during the hottest day 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.650
 guys from believe 75 we all have a 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.630
 winner is the master note 1 lo cooler 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.030
 I recommend to everyone but I also recommend you 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.020
 the other products classified a little 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.930
 behind but that they have 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.070
 truly special specializations 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.000
 which can still be the best 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.620
 for you 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.910
 despite not having won this 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.470
 comparative 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.870
 thanks to cooler master for 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.610
 having supplied me with all the products of the 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.680
 cooperative a hug from place 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.680
 exhausted qaeda is really everything
