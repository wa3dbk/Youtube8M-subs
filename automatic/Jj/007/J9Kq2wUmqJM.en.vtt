playing the game the Beckenham and
there's<00:00:03.510> really<00:00:03.689> only<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.110> little<00:00:04.440> bit<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.859> what

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I can say about this basically this

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.419 
I can say about this basically this
entire<00:00:07.680> game<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:09.480> centered<00:00:10.380> around<00:00:10.469> hoping

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
entire game is centered around hoping

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.810 
entire game is centered around hoping
that<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.880> get<00:00:12.059> these<00:00:12.240> three<00:00:12.719> items<00:00:13.820> when

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
that you can get these three items when

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.010 
that you can get these three items when
you<00:00:14.849> get<00:00:15.059> those<00:00:15.179> three<00:00:15.360> items<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:15.900> to

you get those three items you have to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.120 
you get those three items you have to
search<00:00:16.170> around<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> house<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.859> little

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
search around the house for a little

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.950 
search around the house for a little
ghost<00:00:17.310> girl<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.910> those<00:00:18.060> three<00:00:18.270> items<00:00:18.539> -

ghost girl to get those three items -

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
ghost girl to get those three items -
and<00:00:19.230> hopefully<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.609> don't<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:21.000> killed

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and hopefully you don't get killed

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.000 
and hopefully you don't get killed
randomly<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> processor<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
randomly in the processor which is

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.349 
randomly in the processor which is
something<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
something I really don't like about the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.390 
something I really don't like about the
game<00:00:24.390> which<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:25.859> basically<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
game which is that you know basically I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.839 
game which is that you know basically I
ought<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:26.910> killed<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.269> any<00:00:27.359> point<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.840> time

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
ought to get killed at any point in time

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.669 
ought to get killed at any point in time
what<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.880> found<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.199> find<00:00:31.439> this

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
what I found is that you will find this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.560 
what I found is that you will find this
older<00:00:32.279> woman<00:00:32.870> type<00:00:33.870> ghost<00:00:34.290> thing<00:00:34.880> which<00:00:35.880> if

older woman type ghost thing which if

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
older woman type ghost thing which if
you<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.200> her<00:00:37.380> three<00:00:37.649> times<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.340> basically

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you see her three times that's basically

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.510 
you see her three times that's basically
the<00:00:39.840> game<00:00:40.050> saying<00:00:40.500> well<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.820> gonna<00:00:42.030> die

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
the game saying well you're gonna die

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.590 
the game saying well you're gonna die
handprints<00:00:44.520> you'll<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.850> around<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> game<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
handprints you'll see around the game I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.490 
handprints you'll see around the game I
don't<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.289> any<00:00:47.180> big<00:00:48.230> reason<00:00:49.230> why<00:00:49.350> they

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
don't really see any big reason why they

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.959 
don't really see any big reason why they
should<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.309> than<00:00:50.399> dad<00:00:50.670> -<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
should be there other than dad - the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
should be there other than dad - the
suspense<00:00:51.329> factor<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.170> oh<00:00:52.530> no<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.920> gonna<00:00:53.070> die

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
suspense factor of oh no I'm gonna die

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.170 
suspense factor of oh no I'm gonna die
soon<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.129> ghost<00:00:56.399> girl<00:00:56.550> has<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

I<00:01:09.750> thought<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> were<00:01:10.140> supposed<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I thought you were supposed to do is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.170 
I thought you were supposed to do is
just<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> wait<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.460> no<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.000> need<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
just kind of wait around no you need to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.830 
just kind of wait around no you need to
go<00:01:12.299> looking<00:01:12.570> around<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.960> house<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
go looking around the house and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
go looking around the house and
eventually<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> older<00:01:16.229> ghost<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:17.310> come<00:01:17.340> at

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
eventually the older ghost will come at

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
eventually the older ghost will come at
you<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.890> sit

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you and I don't know if you can just sit

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
you and I don't know if you can just sit
there<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> older<00:01:21.000> ghost<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
there where the older ghost is there and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
there where the older ghost is there and
the<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.290> daughter<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:23.009> take<00:01:23.189> care<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the little daughter will take care of it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
the little daughter will take care of it
but<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:24.060> clicking<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:25.110> girl

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
but I was clicking on the little girl

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
but I was clicking on the little girl
ghost<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.979> crazy<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.750> don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
ghost like crazy and I really don't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
ghost like crazy and I really don't
think<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.350> play<00:01:28.530> again<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
think I can play again and get to that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.240 
think I can play again and get to that
point<00:01:29.939> at<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.390> win<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.740> find<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.100> whether

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
point at which I win to find out whether

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
point at which I win to find out whether
or<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.520> clicking<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.030> necessary<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
or not clicking is necessary because it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
or not clicking is necessary because it
was<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.380> difficult<00:01:34.619> game<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> beat<00:01:35.340> based

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
was a very difficult game to beat based

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
was a very difficult game to beat based
on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> fact<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.180> your<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.960> hope<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
on the fact that your only hope of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
on the fact that your only hope of
completing<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.369> chance<00:01:41.119> there<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
completing it was chance there really is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
completing it was chance there really is
nothing<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.170> say<00:01:43.320> other<00:01:43.920> than<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
nothing more I can say other than the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.789 
nothing more I can say other than the
fact<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.090> time-based<00:01:45.770> but<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
fact that's not really time-based but I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.899 
fact that's not really time-based but I
did<00:01:47.009> find<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> were<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.820> sitting

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
did find that if you were just sitting

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.230 
did find that if you were just sitting
in<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.270> spot<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.649> long<00:01:49.770> time

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
in one spot for a really long time

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
in one spot for a really long time
generally<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> next<00:01:51.780> move<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.320> would

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
generally the next move that you would

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.179 
generally the next move that you would
make<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:53.579> end<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.509> death<00:01:54.570> I've<00:01:55.189> had

make would end in your death I've had

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.190 
make would end in your death I've had
like<00:01:56.780> 69000<00:01:57.780> seconds<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:58.590> something<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:58.979> time

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
like 69000 seconds or something in time

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.670 
like 69000 seconds or something in time
and<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:01.370> don't<00:02:02.090> know<00:02:02.270> how<00:02:02.420> they<00:02:02.540> FaceTime<00:02:03.470> maybe

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
and I don't know how they FaceTime maybe

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.050 
and I don't know how they FaceTime maybe
it's<00:02:03.830> milliseconds<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:04.550> don't<00:02:04.729> know

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's milliseconds I don't know

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
and eight moves and I lost generally my

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.510 
and eight moves and I lost generally my
moves<00:02:09.170> like<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.979> amount<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.190> movies<00:02:10.369> that

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
moves like the amount of movies that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.650 
moves like the amount of movies that
they<00:02:10.610> gave<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.760> before<00:02:14.390> you

the fewest moves I've gotten was 12 I

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.000 
the fewest moves I've gotten was 12 I
recommend<00:02:27.110> moving<00:02:27.380> through<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> game<00:02:27.800> pretty

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
recommend moving through the game pretty

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.610 
recommend moving through the game pretty
fastly<00:02:28.580> because<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.209> may<00:02:29.569> be<00:02:29.600> time<00:02:30.050> based<00:02:30.380> I'm

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
fastly because it may be time based I'm

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.500 
fastly because it may be time based I'm
not<00:02:30.800> quite<00:02:31.040> sure<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.550> game<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.760> still<00:02:32.120> kind<00:02:32.360> of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
not quite sure the game is still kind of

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.270 
not quite sure the game is still kind of
random<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.050> up<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.290> grabs<00:02:33.530> for<00:02:33.800> any<00:02:33.950> really

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
random and up to grabs for any really

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.240 
random and up to grabs for any really
suggestion<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.560> very<00:02:40.040> good

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
suggestion for it's a very good

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.300 
suggestion for it's a very good
environmentally<00:02:40.970> based<00:02:41.060> game<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:42.260> think<00:02:42.920> that

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
environmentally based game I think that

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.490 
environmentally based game I think that
the<00:02:43.730> creator<00:02:44.090> Don<00:02:44.390> land<00:02:44.720> who<00:02:45.019> also<00:02:45.230> created

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the creator Don land who also created

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.320 
the creator Don land who also created
the<00:02:45.860> game<00:02:46.040> soul<00:02:46.370> sister<00:02:46.760> which<00:02:47.000> I'll<00:02:47.120> probably

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the game soul sister which I'll probably

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.750 
the game soul sister which I'll probably
give<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.600> link<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.070> really<00:02:49.340> good<00:02:49.489> job

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
give a link to then a really good job

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.370 
give a link to then a really good job
with<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.590> whole<00:02:51.800> scary<00:02:52.430> environment<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.930> think

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
with the whole scary environment I think

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.890 
with the whole scary environment I think
the<00:02:54.709> what<00:02:55.340> she<00:02:55.550> kind<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.090> struggled<00:02:56.510> with<00:02:56.660> and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the what she kind of struggled with and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.240 
the what she kind of struggled with and
could<00:02:57.140> have<00:02:57.260> made<00:02:57.410> better<00:02:57.440> was<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.890> whole

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
could have made better was the whole

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.090 
could have made better was the whole
chance<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:59.000> living<00:02:59.269> or<00:02:59.540> dying<00:02:59.920> success<00:03:00.920> or

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
chance of living or dying success or

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.090 
chance of living or dying success or
failure<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:02.620> transitions<00:03:03.620> were<00:03:03.739> kind<00:03:03.980> of

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
failure and transitions were kind of

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.039 
failure and transitions were kind of
weird<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.850> guess<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.180> was<00:03:05.329> all<00:03:05.360> supposed<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
weird but I guess it was all supposed to

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.289 
weird but I guess it was all supposed to
add<00:03:06.170> into<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.560> whole<00:03:06.890> suspense<00:03:07.370> factor<00:03:07.880> and

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
add into that whole suspense factor and

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.610 
add into that whole suspense factor and
was<00:03:08.570> also<00:03:08.750> kind<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:10.420> frustrating<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.450> have<00:03:11.720> so

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
was also kind of frustrating to have so

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.150 
was also kind of frustrating to have so
many<00:03:12.920> places<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.610> go<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.620> really<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:15.799> a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
many places to go and really have a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.250 
many places to go and really have a
little<00:03:16.400> amount<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.910> time<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.660> find<00:03:17.840> what<00:03:18.110> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
little amount of time to find what you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.250 
little amount of time to find what you
need<00:03:18.500> get<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.160> all<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.579> girl<00:03:19.850> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
need get it all to the girl and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.930 
need get it all to the girl and
basically<00:03:21.260> after<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.489> really<00:03:22.790> don't

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
basically after that you really don't

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.449 
basically after that you really don't
have<00:03:23.000> anything<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.329> worry<00:03:23.510> about

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
have anything to worry about

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.720 
have anything to worry about
I<00:03:25.930> feel<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.049> it's<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.260> good<00:03:27.350> game<00:03:27.620> but<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.519> guess

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
I feel like it's a good game but I guess

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.069 
I feel like it's a good game but I guess
that's<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.000> because<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.329> beat<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.540> when<00:03:29.840> I

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
that's just because I beat it when I

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.500 
that's just because I beat it when I
couldn't<00:03:31.010> beat<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.459> was<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:31.880> frustrated<00:03:32.090> but

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
couldn't beat it I was so frustrated but

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.759 
couldn't beat it I was so frustrated but
this<00:03:32.630> game<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:33.019> was<00:03:33.110> like<00:03:33.290> who<00:03:34.250> makes<00:03:34.549> this<00:03:34.880> game

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
this game I was like who makes this game

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.370 
this game I was like who makes this game
but<00:03:37.239> yeah<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:40.670> really<00:03:41.329> all<00:03:41.630> there<00:03:41.810> is

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
but yeah so it's really all there is

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.640 
but yeah so it's really all there is
I<00:03:44.060> managed<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.300> record<00:03:45.540> winning<00:03:46.020> because<00:03:46.290> I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
I managed to record winning because I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.680 
I managed to record winning because I
noticed<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.100> places<00:03:47.970> really<00:03:48.210> didn't<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.660> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
noticed that places really didn't have a
