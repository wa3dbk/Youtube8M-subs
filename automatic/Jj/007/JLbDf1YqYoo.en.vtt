00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.520 

then<00:04:23.250> thus<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:25.210> call<00:04:25.930> off<00:04:26.080> faster

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
then thus the on call off faster

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.360 
then thus the on call off faster
off-color<00:04:27.430> know<00:04:28.419> yeah<00:04:29.199> that's<00:04:29.800> off-color

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
off-color know yeah that's off-color

that's<00:04:30.729> on<00:04:30.970> color<00:04:31.240> really<00:04:31.780> he<00:04:32.320> should<00:04:32.530> change

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
that's on color really he should change

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.800 
that's on color really he should change
it<00:04:32.919> as<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.250> other<00:04:33.370> way<00:04:33.550> around<00:04:33.789> but<00:04:33.940> also<00:04:34.570> it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
it as the other way around but also it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.450 
it as the other way around but also it
is<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.160> then<00:04:36.370> we<00:04:36.729> can<00:04:36.940> delete<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.509> and<00:04:38.190> um<00:04:39.190> I

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.750 
the first thing I think did I know I
didn't<00:05:34.000> wait<00:05:34.240> yeah<00:05:34.810> I<00:05:34.870> did<00:05:35.169> aes<00:05:36.099> transparent

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
didn't wait yeah I did aes transparent

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.110 
didn't wait yeah I did aes transparent
FF<00:05:37.150> is<00:05:37.389> a<00:05:37.590> solid<00:05:38.590> so<00:05:38.830> if<00:05:38.979> you<00:05:39.099> do<00:05:39.220> your<00:05:39.639> ex<00:05:39.880> you

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
FF is a solid so if you do your ex you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.000 
FF is a solid so if you do your ex you
have<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.330> have<00:05:40.449> a<00:05:40.570> tea<00:05:40.690> or<00:05:41.020> FF<00:05:41.440> before<00:05:41.889> the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
have to have a tea or FF before the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.040 
have to have a tea or FF before the
colligative<00:05:42.599> otherwise<00:05:43.599> it<00:05:43.840> won't<00:05:43.990> work

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
colligative otherwise it won't work

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.740 
colligative otherwise it won't work
because<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.860> can<00:05:45.099> turn<00:05:45.250> up<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.460> way<00:05:45.760> so<00:05:46.570> when

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
because I can turn up that way so when

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.520 
because I can turn up that way so when
we<00:05:46.870> press<00:05:47.110> X<00:05:47.409> and<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:48.550> x-ray<00:05:49.000> will<00:05:49.300> toggle<00:05:49.570> one

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
we press X and the x-ray will toggle one

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.339 
we press X and the x-ray will toggle one
would<00:05:50.680> press<00:05:50.889> see<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.400> go<00:05:51.759> green<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.659> full

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
would press see it go green and the full

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.170 
would press see it go green and the full
backward<00:05:53.650> toggle<00:05:53.979> but<00:05:54.460> has<00:05:54.669> ever<00:05:54.849> made<00:05:55.120> the

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
backward toggle but has ever made the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.240 
backward toggle but has ever made the
hack<00:05:55.479> if<00:05:55.720> we<00:05:55.840> can't<00:05:56.080> see<00:05:56.259> it<00:05:56.560> alls<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:57.039> stuff

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
hack if we can't see it alls and stuff

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.180 
hack if we can't see it alls and stuff
