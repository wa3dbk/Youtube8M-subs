00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
they have this steel chassis that's a

trellis<00:00:45.360> type<00:00:45.629> frame<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.559> you've<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.950> this

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
trellis type frame so you've got this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
trellis type frame so you've got this
triangle<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.520> that<00:00:50.520> connects<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
triangle right here that connects to the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.880 
triangle right here that connects to the
frame<00:00:51.360> there's<00:00:51.629> no<00:00:51.750> frame<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.469> down<00:00:52.649> here

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
frame there's no frame going down here

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
frame there's no frame going down here
around<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.399> motor<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.059> motor<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> stress

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
around the motor the motor is a stress

part<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> frame<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.120> add<00:00:57.449> some

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
part of the frame and so you add some

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.939 
part of the frame and so you add some
strength<00:00:57.989> while<00:00:58.199> keeping<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> light<00:00:58.710> weight
