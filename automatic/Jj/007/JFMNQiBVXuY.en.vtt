00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.930
 count the seas that the new album that 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.010
 let's go to present tonight is an album 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:18.699
 which starts from the Mediterranean sea what 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.190
 quite normal for me because being 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.179
 born in palermo i always had it as a 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.880
 lunar natural factor and from there it is always 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.769
 how to say my curiosity rested 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.250
 always on fairy tales that that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.680
 they just popped up with this element 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.629
 very strong and these fables are found 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.670
 a little in the whole Mediterranean area below 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.399
 but there are other forms with other names 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.930
 matrix and from there it practically came to me 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.850
 the idea also of making people talk about 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.000
 fairy tales like the black fairy tales and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.180
 even not only the white fairy tales that 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.519
 they are the stories of what will happen 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.309
 the sea there are so many guests 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.350
 let's say this is an album that like 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.150
 always agricantus met 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.010
 equally in itself but in this that there 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.720
 we are self overcome because there are so many 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.730
 collaborations both on disk and for 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.650
 regarding the concert the new ones 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.460
 agricantus projects are definitely 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.530
 to go and meet what 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.770
 the future holds us for sure 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.800
 will be the populations that are a little 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.350

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.450

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.750
