00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.990
 I present my Easter 1913 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.220
 and I'll tell you how he started it in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.040
 cold times and employment in winter 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.530
 first of all we put the accelerator 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.530
 more or less halfway through 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.190
 then we will pull the lever towards 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.790
 outside and we turn it to the left 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.790
 we will hear a click 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.670
 with the steering wheel I look for the top point 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.699
 12 and do not put the string and spin 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.719
 the steering wheel to lower the brake and let 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.719
 the rolled rope 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.940
 then he uncovered the nozzle inside 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.940
 of the cylinder 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.830
 then in an aluminum tube 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.830
 that I recovered from an open cigar two 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.830
 or three cubic centimeters of diesel oil what 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.160
 I heat and the open in the nozzle of the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.160
 top 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.180
 is ready for the pull has given 5 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.510
 or 6 compressions and usually ends 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.510
 First 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.060
 I hope it has been helpful
