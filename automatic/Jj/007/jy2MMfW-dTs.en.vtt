your P stone we're going to show you how

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.139 
your P stone we're going to show you how
this<00:02:03.039> all<00:02:03.219> comes<00:02:03.700> together

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
this all comes together

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.359 
this all comes together
so<00:02:04.989> before<00:02:05.259> we<00:02:05.380> start<00:02:05.619> cutting<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.069> want<00:02:06.249> to<00:02:06.309> go

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
so before we start cutting I want to go

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.580 
so before we start cutting I want to go
over<00:02:06.459> some<00:02:06.609> safety<00:02:06.759> issues<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.989> grandeur<00:02:08.440> is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
over some safety issues the grandeur is

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.039 
over some safety issues the grandeur is
very<00:02:08.770> loud<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.729> want<00:02:10.209> some<00:02:10.390> ear<00:02:10.569> muffs<00:02:10.840> and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
very loud so you want some ear muffs and

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.830 
very loud so you want some ear muffs and
you<00:02:11.860> also<00:02:12.069> want<00:02:12.640> some<00:02:12.790> eye<00:02:12.939> protection

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you also want some eye protection

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.559 
you also want some eye protection
I<00:02:13.870> remember<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:15.069> always<00:02:15.850> important<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.480> look

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
I remember it's always important to look

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:31.260 
I remember it's always important to look
good<00:02:16.720> while<00:02:17.470> being<00:02:17.650> safe

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.450 

so<00:02:31.990> we're<00:02:32.140> halfway<00:02:32.320> through<00:02:32.530> installing<00:02:33.160> our

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
so we're halfway through installing our

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.940 
so we're halfway through installing our
edging<00:02:33.930> before<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.050> start<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.530> kind<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.800> want

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
edging before you start you kind of want

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.700 
edging before you start you kind of want
to<00:02:36.010> know<00:02:36.100> your<00:02:36.400> layout<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.870> case<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.500> have

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
to know your layout in this case we have

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.710 
to know your layout in this case we have
five<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> half<00:02:39.400> feet<00:02:39.700> off<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.000> foundation

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
five and a half feet off the foundation

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.020 
five and a half feet off the foundation
and<00:02:41.290> once<00:02:41.470> we<00:02:41.590> pass<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.980> foundation<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.880> is

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
and once we pass the foundation it is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.640 
and once we pass the foundation it is
closing<00:02:43.390> into<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> four-foot<00:02:44.830> fly<00:02:45.390> walkway<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
closing into a four-foot fly walkway so

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.240 
closing into a four-foot fly walkway so
it's<00:02:48.750> as<00:02:49.750> simple<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.380> all<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.040> need<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
it's as simple as this all you need to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.630 
it's as simple as this all you need to
do

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
do

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.000 
do
there's<00:02:52.570> slots<00:02:52.960> in<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.380> edging<00:02:53.710> for<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
there's slots in the edging for the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.930 
there's slots in the edging for the
spikes<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:56.500> sure<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.920> your<00:02:57.340> curve<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:57.730> right

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
spikes make sure the your curve is right

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.390 
spikes make sure the your curve is right
or<00:02:58.180> your<00:02:58.360> line<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.750> correct<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.950> all<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.250> have

or your line is correct and all you have
to<00:03:00.490> do<00:03:00.580> take<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.880> hammer<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.450> tap<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.960> it's<00:03:17.110> time

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
to do take a hammer and tap so it's time

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.310 
to do take a hammer and tap so it's time
to<00:03:17.380> make<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.530> cut<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.940> simple<00:03:19.240> as<00:03:19.390> measuring<00:03:20.020> and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
to make a cut as simple as measuring and

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.980 
to make a cut as simple as measuring and
cutting<00:03:20.500> what<00:03:20.860> we<00:03:20.980> like<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.190> use<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.990> soapstone

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
cutting what we like to use is soapstone

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.590 
cutting what we like to use is soapstone
it<00:03:23.920> draws<00:03:24.190> great<00:03:24.520> on<00:03:24.700> metal<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.150> also<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
it draws great on metal and also the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.330 
it draws great on metal and also the
speeds<00:03:25.870> where<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.350> get<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> nice<00:03:26.680> straight

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
speeds where so you get a nice straight

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.480 
speeds where so you get a nice straight
cut<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:28.270> want<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> make<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.750> cut<00:03:29.050> at<00:03:29.490> 63

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
cut we want to make this cut at 63

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.410 
cut we want to make this cut at 63
inches<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:33.160> just<00:03:33.370> as<00:03:33.520> simple<00:03:33.910> as<00:03:34.120> using<00:03:34.300> your

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
inches it's just as simple as using your

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.160 
inches it's just as simple as using your
speed<00:03:34.750> square<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.140> lining<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.500> up<00:03:37.110> now<00:03:38.110> you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
speed square and lining it up now you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:04:03.589 
speed square and lining it up now you
have<00:03:38.320> a<00:03:38.380> line

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.780 

so<00:04:04.599> before<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.560> get<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.769> stone<00:04:06.010> in<00:04:06.250> one<00:04:06.670> of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
so before you get the stone in one of

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.949 
so before you get the stone in one of
the<00:04:06.879> final<00:04:07.239> things<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.510> do

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
the final things to do

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.030 
the final things to do
well<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.920> we<00:04:09.040> like<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.370> do<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:09.730> go<00:04:10.480> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
well that we like to do is go and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.039 
well that we like to do is go and
spray-paint<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.670> tops<00:04:13.030> because<00:04:13.569> when<00:04:13.900> you're

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
spray-paint the tops because when you're

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.430 
spray-paint the tops because when you're
a<00:04:14.080> meringue<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:15.580> finish<00:04:15.959> starts<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.049> chip<00:04:17.229> off

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
a meringue the finish starts to chip off

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.620 
a meringue the finish starts to chip off
and<00:04:17.769> you'll<00:04:18.310> actually<00:04:18.459> get<00:04:18.790> rust<00:04:19.120> spots<00:04:19.389> if

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
and you'll actually get rust spots if

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.629 
and you'll actually get rust spots if
you<00:04:19.750> have<00:04:19.900> exposed<00:04:20.350> steel<00:04:21.100> which<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.489> don't

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
you have exposed steel which you don't

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.719 
you have exposed steel which you don't
want<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:22.419> we<00:04:22.540> just<00:04:22.690> go<00:04:22.810> back<00:04:23.020> with<00:04:23.440> some<00:04:23.770> you
