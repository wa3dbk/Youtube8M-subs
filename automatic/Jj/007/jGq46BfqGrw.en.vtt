00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:08.130
 that's the way it is 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.050
 are everywhere we go 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.329
 something new new species new animal communities new biological 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.329
 relationships 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.100
 I studied biology and then one day I got a call 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.330
 from all 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.680
 Scientists from a neighboring institute are in urgent need of assistance 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.830
 on a research trip what am I coming to me 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.740
 Clearly, of course, one thing is not exactly so intriguing that I'm fascinated 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 in the forest, nevertheless, of the two lovers 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.780
 crying study area where I work most is the deep sea before the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
 Coast off Pakistan 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.650
 whether Pakistani-Chinese border 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.850
 Plates on top of each other so that the continental board passes through light 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.710
 huge pushing up of pigments these bridges systems are sea bottom 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.890
 are exciting for us because Esther comes to that with Hahn am 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.890
 Seabed exit 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.120
 still bubbles even in water depths of 3000 meters 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
 and now it is in the future 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.900
 watching how much methane really comes out in the form of gas bubbles 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 print 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.700
 on the meteor can ride up to 30 scientists 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.310
 now come again 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.439
 about 30 men from the crew from the captain to the sailors and protests 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 that is our attention 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.769
 a diving robot of the seabed among many 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.159
 you can see the movie 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.159
 Camera system is equipped 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.170
 just by watching exactly what we see on the seabed 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.170
 we learn a lot about it 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 Ulm 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.059
 the next step is then the center at the bottom of the sea 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.599
 we have a device that will be a sign 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.079
 but it is basically a vacuum cleaner whose negative pressure generated 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.629
 they would become a son and they will be a container 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.920
 and made out with Hamit 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 Dead organic matter that are mainly plankton organisms 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.649
 Friemel here and finances the sea surface 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.809
 the giants from the sea surface on the seabed 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.809
 Warendorf buried over thousands of years 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.489
 This organic material is broken down to ride and if it is certain 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.729
 Temperatures Troop Damon experiences in the sediments 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.729
 then this methane forms 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.409
 it looks like it used to 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.089
 and if there is still a brand 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.499
 so one must not with certainty not hold everything in hand for it 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.019
 necessary 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 Lienen's almost ten years of experience 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.549
 4 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.869
 one of these duties 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:11.809
 all the organisms that have been collected during this journey 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.519
 for example, mussels 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.419
 and they can assume that all 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.840
 just nice as we have containers here in the samples now that's all 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.840
 new species have not been described yet 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.270
 May 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.919
 Being on a research vessel means to me in my element 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:52.590
 his 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.090
 that is the life that we as a scientist also cloudy 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.009
 that is pioneering work that is 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.629
 yes that is not food 10 9
