00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
deck is to bounce back cuts like this on

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.010 
deck is to bounce back cuts like this on
these<00:02:55.280> two<00:02:55.790> back<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> your<00:02:56.150> hand<00:02:56.330> because<00:02:56.810> when

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
counter blast to draw more cards so yeah

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.759 
counter blast to draw more cards so yeah
this<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.780> one<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.200> ways<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.440> get<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.830 
on and the best part of it is another
engine<00:03:58.579> of<00:03:58.700> that<00:03:58.730> is<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.269> course<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.660> process

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
engine of that is of course the process

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.729 
engine of that is of course the process
to<00:04:00.140> engine<00:04:00.579> which<00:04:01.579> is<00:04:01.610> using<00:04:02.030> her<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:03.200> draw

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
to engine which is using her as a draw

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.560 
to engine which is using her as a draw
engine<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.220> for<00:04:04.430> somebody<00:04:04.610> just<00:04:04.910> call<00:04:05.450> her

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
engine like for somebody just call her

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.199 
engine like for somebody just call her
out<00:04:06.070> boosts<00:04:07.070> give<00:04:07.670> further<00:04:07.910> effect

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
out boosts give further effect

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.819 
out boosts give further effect
especially<00:04:08.420> effec<00:04:08.720> which<00:04:08.989> is<00:04:09.110> when<00:04:09.560> he's<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
especially effec which is when he's the

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.160 
especially effec which is when he's the
banker<00:04:10.040> he<00:04:10.130> gets<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.519> charged<00:04:10.820> one<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.420> draw

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
banker he gets so charged one and draw

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.250 
banker he gets so charged one and draw
one<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:13.640> of<00:04:13.819> course<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.060> could<00:04:14.209> so<00:04:14.930> blast<00:04:15.140> the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
one and of course you could so blast the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.539 
one and of course you could so blast the
bouncer<00:04:15.590> back<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:15.890> use<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.190> next<00:04:16.220> and

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
bouncer back and use it the next and

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:16.750 
bouncer back and use it the next and
again

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
again

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.550 
again
but<00:04:17.390> this<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.690> not<00:04:17.870> really<00:04:18.050> useful<00:04:18.500> when

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
but this is not really useful when

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.770 
but this is not really useful when
opponents<00:04:19.010> at<00:04:19.220> for<00:04:19.880> fire<00:04:20.150> damage<00:04:20.480> because

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
opponents at for fire damage because

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.420 
opponents at for fire damage because
they<00:04:21.020> are<00:04:21.110> mostly<00:04:21.380> guarded<00:04:21.830> anyway

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
they are mostly guarded anyway

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.310 
they are mostly guarded anyway
but<00:04:22.880> during<00:04:23.030> early<00:04:23.300> game<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:23.630> this<00:04:24.140> can

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
but during early game this this can

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.960 
but during early game this this can
either<00:04:24.500> pressure<00:04:24.770> opponent<00:04:25.250> or<00:04:25.370> defeat

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
either pressure opponent or defeat

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.730 
either pressure opponent or defeat
oh<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.600> know<00:04:26.840> give<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.230> card<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.530> want

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
oh you know give you the card you want

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.570 
oh you know give you the card you want
like<00:04:28.190> drops<00:04:28.490> no<00:04:28.730> cause<00:04:30.070> that's<00:04:31.070> not<00:04:31.250> that's

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
like drops no cause that's not that's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.280 
like drops no cause that's not that's
not<00:04:31.730> only<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.060> few<00:04:32.330> ways<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:32.630> could<00:04:32.810> also<00:04:32.930> you

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
not only the few ways you could also you

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.970 
not only the few ways you could also you
know<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.590> could<00:04:33.860> also<00:04:33.980> use<00:04:34.250> her<00:04:35.680> if<00:04:36.680> you

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
know you could also use her if you

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.340 
know you could also use her if you
really<00:04:37.250> need<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.580> like<00:04:37.960> let's<00:04:38.960> say<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.140> let

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
really need to like let's say you let

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.560 
really need to like let's say you let
game<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.650> don't<00:04:39.770> let<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.040> hit<00:04:40.280> or<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.450> have

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
game you don't let you hit or you have

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.240 
game you don't let you hit or you have
no<00:04:41.930> more<00:04:42.170> laying<00:04:42.500> on<00:04:42.650> your<00:04:42.680> deck<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.100> could

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
no more laying on your deck you could
