00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.340
 show at the 2014 cashier area 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.439
 We have a remodeling a mum 09 of ours 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 Dealer yamaha motorcycle small out of the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.300
 Saarland and the company is small here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 Just shown something for one 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 Road model as the MT 09 is possible 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 if one was also on the trains 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.170
 wants to move racecourse one is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.280
 Hergang has various features 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.320
 taken and the corresponding 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.650
 has revised a fork built-in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.420
 with correspondingly large attitudes with 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.170
 stable postures one has a radial 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.180
 built -in brake system and taken 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 then said we will want then 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.290
 Of course, we continue to do that consistently 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.489
 Continue it is a motor tuning 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.210
 then carried out accordingly 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.370
 been 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 but there are many really 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.409
 customized style elements at this 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.200
 This is about the very small vehicle 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.659
 Led blinker that goes over the radial 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.780
 brake pumps very much anodized 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.180
 material was used for this purpose 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 akrapovic exhaust system too 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.400
 is approvable according to us 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.670
 also consider a brake brake system 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.610
 the rear wheel brake built-in wave 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.380
 slices and a modification of the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690
 landing gear accordingly 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.820
 racetracks is suitable 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.770
 based on the well-known model mt 07 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.540
 a very reasonably priced model 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.670
 allround model for both 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.400
 beginners as well as advanced 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.440
 is suitable we have a conversion the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240
 we show here on the custombike 2014 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.100
 if we start at the beginning then we see 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.410
 for example, here too 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.690
 corresponding rims corresponding pvm 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.070
 rims and that continues then in 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:05.159
 a big 43 mm upside down fork and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.409
 radially installed brembo brakes as 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.120
 brake system with appropriate hand 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.019
 brake cylinders an underrun protection for 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.470
 the levers 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.450
 to a corresponding handlebar construction 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.159
 the one qualified of all the handlebars 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.959
 then picks up and for one 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.720
 sportier, more ambitious 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.940
 driving position provides another feature 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.530
 Of course, having your vehicle is the one 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.319
 Carbon share 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.150
 from the company 3c were specially carbon 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.250
 Elements made for this vehicle 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.930
 which excellently in the complete 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.480
 insert optics of the vehicle 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.540
 that starts at the corresponding lamps 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.910
 disguise settles over diverse 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.790
 design elements continues and ends at the rear in 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.530
 a very special short tail 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.580
 Construction made of full carbon 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.940
 was made 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.190
 We see some painted parts 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.459
 on the engine half on the swingarm 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.800
 we'll see with the extra 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.950
 milled in logo again in addition 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.160
 a brake system milled from the full 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.320
 fully adjustable adjustable very light 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.300
 very nice from the optics 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.780
 this is easy milling technology in 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.780
 completion
