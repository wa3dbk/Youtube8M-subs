front<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.140> me<00:00:04.200> here<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.589> 440<00:00:05.460> fan<00:00:06.319> stator

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
front of me here is a 440 fan stator

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.910 
front of me here is a 440 fan stator
from<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.309> early<00:00:08.880> nineties<00:00:09.450> here<00:00:09.809> these<00:00:10.710> were

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
from the early nineties here these were

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.640 
from the early nineties here these were
used<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.550> several<00:00:12.480> models<00:00:12.929> you'd<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
used in several models you'd have to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.350 
used in several models you'd have to
check<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.130> which<00:00:14.280> one's<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.700> decor

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
check and see which one's the decor

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.420 
check and see which one's the decor
linked<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.960> were<00:00:16.049> used<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:16.740> this

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
linked to and were used in but this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.859 
linked to and were used in but this
model<00:00:17.670> here<00:00:18.119> we'll<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.330> take<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> look<00:00:18.720> at<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
model here we'll just take a look at the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.390 
model here we'll just take a look at the
state<00:00:19.050> or<00:00:19.199> itself<00:00:19.529> first<00:00:19.859> we've<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.279> our

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
state or itself first we've got our

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.310 
state or itself first we've got our
three<00:00:20.699> lighting<00:00:20.910> coils<00:00:21.449> we've<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.050> two

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
three lighting coils we've got one two

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.259 
three lighting coils we've got one two
three<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.039> they're<00:00:23.160> always<00:00:23.490> indicated<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
three and they're always indicated the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.099 
three and they're always indicated the
largest<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> largest<00:00:26.099> gauge<00:00:26.699> wire<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
largest the largest gauge wire on the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
largest the largest gauge wire on the
stator<00:00:28.650> itself<00:00:29.189> those<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.730> lighting

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
stator itself those are your lighting

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.179 
stator itself those are your lighting
coils<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.289> has<00:00:31.439> three<00:00:31.679> large<00:00:31.920> ones

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
coils so this one has three large ones

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
coils so this one has three large ones
and<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:32.790> our<00:00:32.910> other<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.300> coils<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.899> here

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and then our other two coils on here

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.139 
and then our other two coils on here
stacked<00:00:34.530> horizontally<00:00:34.739> these<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.700> ignition

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
stacked horizontally these are ignition

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
stacked horizontally these are ignition
coils<00:00:36.600> our<00:00:37.050> bottom<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.100> our

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
coils our bottom one here is our

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
coils our bottom one here is our
low-speed<00:00:38.969> coil<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.290> our

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
low-speed coil and then this is our

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.130 
low-speed coil and then this is our
high-speed<00:00:40.620> coil<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.520> top<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:42.960> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
high-speed coil on top so the way we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.580 
high-speed coil on top so the way we
check<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.860> ohms<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:45.289> well<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.379> take<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
check this for ohms is well we take a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
check this for ohms is well we take a
look<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:46.920> plugs<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.489> first<00:00:47.879> we've<00:00:48.450> got

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
look at our plugs here first we've got

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
look at our plugs here first we've got

our two yellow wire connectors are these
two<00:01:52.380> female<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> go

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
two female here so you just want to go

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
two female here so you just want to go
from<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> ground<00:01:55.110> wire<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.189> common<00:01:56.700> wire

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
from the ground wire to this common wire

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
from the ground wire to this common wire
here<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> basically<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.409> key<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
here and basically that's your key put a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
here and basically that's your key put a
wire<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.640> hooks<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> two<00:02:00.810> loops<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> two

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
wire in it hooks the two loops the two

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
wire in it hooks the two loops the two
together<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.950> you've<00:02:02.579> got<00:02:02.610> connection<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
together and you've got connection and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.450 
together and you've got connection and
then<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.350> unplug<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.159> basic

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
then when you unplug it that's basic

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.130 
then when you unplug it that's basic
your<00:02:05.579> key<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.060> losing<00:02:06.420> connection<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:07.020> can

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
your key or losing connection you can

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.979 
your key or losing connection you can
shut<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> sled<00:02:07.740> off<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.750> plug

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
shut the sled off so so that's our plug

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.300 
shut the sled off so so that's our plug
there<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.099> just

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
there what we can do is we can just

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
there what we can do is we can just
check<00:02:11.489> our<00:02:11.700> lighting<00:02:12.120> coil<00:02:12.390> first<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.930> all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
check our lighting coil first of all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.560 
check our lighting coil first of all
our<00:02:13.980> lighting<00:02:14.310> coil<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> large<00:02:15.210> gauge

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
our lighting coil with the large gauge

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.270 
our lighting coil with the large gauge
wire<00:02:15.870> basically<00:02:16.440> you're<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:16.890> looking<00:02:17.250> for

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
wire basically you're just looking for

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.010 
wire basically you're just looking for
continuity<00:02:17.820> it's<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.480> very<00:02:18.750> low

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
continuity it's going to be very low

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.010 
continuity it's going to be very low
ohms<00:02:19.350> usually<00:02:20.010> under<00:02:20.340> one<00:02:20.670> ohm<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.720> know

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
ohms usually under one ohm so I know

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.230 
ohms usually under one ohm so I know
this<00:02:22.320> unit<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.920> most<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.430> these<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:24.060> this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
this unit here most of these in this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.610 
this unit here most of these in this
style<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.780> doesn't<00:02:25.080> matter<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.590> use

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
style it doesn't matter if you use

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.560 
style it doesn't matter if you use
negative<00:02:26.520> or<00:02:26.640> positive<00:02:26.820> when<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.330> check

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
negative or positive when you check

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.380 
negative or positive when you check
these<00:02:27.890> most<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> ignition<00:02:29.610> or<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.240> sorry

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
these most of the ignition or I'm sorry

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.090 
these most of the ignition or I'm sorry
the<00:02:30.510> lighting<00:02:30.780> coils<00:02:31.380> whether<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.950> this

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the lighting coils whether it be this

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.840 
the lighting coils whether it be this
model<00:02:32.580> or<00:02:32.760> even<00:02:33.150> other<00:02:33.300> models<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:34.050> 0.5<00:02:34.850> 0.4

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
model or even other models like 0.5 0.4

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.600 
model or even other models like 0.5 0.4
you<00:02:36.390> know<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.810> looking<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.230> continuity<00:02:37.650> so

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
you know just looking for continuity so

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.100 
you know just looking for continuity so
on<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.820> multimeter<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:39.990> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
on my multimeter I just have it on the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.550 
on my multimeter I just have it on the
lot<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> lowest<00:02:41.040> setting<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.020> minus<00:02:43.020> 200

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
lot on the lowest setting and minus 200

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.500 
lot on the lowest setting and minus 200
right<00:02:43.740> there<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> 200<00:02:44.700> setting<00:02:45.030> point<00:02:45.300> 5

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
right there on the 200 setting point 5

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.690 
right there on the 200 setting point 5
ohms<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.800> that's<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.100> we're<00:02:47.250> looking<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.520> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
ohms so that's all we're looking for is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.780 
ohms so that's all we're looking for is
continuity<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.630> check<00:02:49.790> continuity

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
continuity you can check continuity

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.790 
continuity you can check continuity
between<00:02:52.880> our<00:02:53.880> plug<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.870> side<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.650> our

is our low-speed coil and our low-speed

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.120 
is our low-speed coil and our low-speed
coil<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.870> checked<00:03:49.260> between<00:03:49.860> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
coil is going to be checked between the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.900 
coil is going to be checked between the
two<00:03:50.430> male<00:03:51.150> connectors<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.799> it's<00:03:53.790> going

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
two male connectors here and it's going

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.449 
two male connectors here and it's going
to<00:03:53.970> give<00:03:54.329> us<00:03:54.480> roughly<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.320> hundred<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.799> fifty

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
to give us roughly one hundred and fifty

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.370 
to give us roughly one hundred and fifty
five<00:03:56.670> ohms<00:03:57.000> got<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:57.630> hundred<00:03:57.870> fifty<00:03:58.140> six

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
five ohms got one hundred fifty six

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.630 
five ohms got one hundred fifty six
point<00:03:58.769> six<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.180> that's<00:04:00.390> our<00:04:00.630> low-speed<00:04:01.170> coil

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
point six so that's our low-speed coil

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.430 
point six so that's our low-speed coil
and<00:04:02.640> you'll<00:04:03.150> notice<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.870> coil<00:04:04.170> is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and you'll notice like this coil is

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.600 
and you'll notice like this coil is
fewer<00:04:05.430> ohms<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.540> like<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.959> 580<00:04:07.560> or<00:04:07.799> 700

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
fewer ohms then the like a 580 or 700

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.970 
fewer ohms then the like a 580 or 700
and<00:04:08.850> that's<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.239> know<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.540> smaller<00:04:09.980> this

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
and that's you know it's a smaller this

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.000 
and that's you know it's a smaller this
this<00:04:11.400> was<00:04:11.610> for<00:04:11.880> 440<00:04:12.750> fan<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.500> we've<00:04:13.650> got<00:04:13.829> our

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
this was for 440 fan so we've got our

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.280 
this was for 440 fan so we've got our
low<00:04:14.160> speed<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.850> now<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.390> check<00:04:15.630> our<00:04:15.930> high

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
low speed and now we can check our high

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.680 
low speed and now we can check our high
speed<00:04:16.350> which<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.070> our<00:04:17.519> female<00:04:18.030> plug<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.600> the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
speed which is our female plug on the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
speed which is our female plug on the
bottom<00:04:18.840> there<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> top<00:04:19.950> left<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.710> top

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
bottom there to the top left and top

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.940 
bottom there to the top left and top
left<00:04:23.099> gives<00:04:23.370> us<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:24.270> seventeen<00:04:24.810> point<00:04:25.289> four

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
left gives us the seventeen point four

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.050 
left gives us the seventeen point four
you<00:04:26.520> know<00:04:26.610> in<00:04:26.760> that

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
you know in that

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.530 
you know in that
ballpark<00:04:27.389> so<00:04:28.220> that's<00:04:29.220> that's<00:04:29.550> good<00:04:29.760> for<00:04:30.000> ohms

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
ballpark so that's that's good for ohms

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.590 
ballpark so that's that's good for ohms
most<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.200> these<00:04:31.320> old<00:04:31.680> style<00:04:32.360> Staters<00:04:33.360> from<00:04:33.510> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
most of these old style Staters from the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.780 
most of these old style Staters from the
early<00:04:33.810> 90s<00:04:34.230> with<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.410> horizontal<00:04:34.790> ignition

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
early 90s with the horizontal ignition

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.129 
early 90s with the horizontal ignition
coils<00:04:36.150> on<00:04:36.300> them<00:04:36.510> they're<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:36.900> ballpark

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
coils on them they're in that ballpark

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.720 
coils on them they're in that ballpark
15<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:38.190> 17<00:04:38.760> maybe<00:04:39.270> 18<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:41.550> don't

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
15 to 17 maybe 18 so you you don't

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.220 
15 to 17 maybe 18 so you you don't
necessarily<00:04:41.940> have<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.419> look<00:04:42.600> up<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.720> exact

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
necessarily have to look up the exact

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.430 
necessarily have to look up the exact
specs<00:04:43.650> all<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.100> time<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.080> our<00:04:46.260> last

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
specs all the time and then our last

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.860 
specs all the time and then our last
reading<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.639> going<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:47.940> be<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.120> two<00:04:48.270> coils<00:04:48.540> in

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
reading is going to be the two coils in

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.940 
reading is going to be the two coils in
series<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.510> those<00:04:51.900> two<00:04:51.960> or<00:04:52.470> added

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
series and that is those two or added

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.750 
series and that is those two or added
together<00:04:53.130> are<00:04:53.460> 155<00:04:54.270> then<00:04:54.600> our<00:04:54.720> 17<00:04:55.290> there<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:56.460> in

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
together are 155 then our 17 there so in

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.050 
together are 155 then our 17 there so in
series<00:04:57.620> 173<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.860> some<00:04:59.010> change<00:04:59.310> point<00:04:59.790> six

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
series 173 and some change point six

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.879 
series 173 and some change point six
point<00:05:00.330> seven<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.760> now<00:05:02.760> we<00:05:02.820> know<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.150> our

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
point seven so now we know that our

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.650 
point seven so now we know that our
ignition<00:05:04.889> coils<00:05:05.760> if<00:05:06.000> you're<00:05:06.150> checking<00:05:06.360> this

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
ignition coils if you're checking this

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.600 
ignition coils if you're checking this
on<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> sled<00:05:07.320> or<00:05:07.620> even<00:05:07.889> out<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.190> sled<00:05:08.460> our

is okay this little common wire just if

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.710 
is okay this little common wire just if
you<00:05:20.010> tick<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.760> sheath<00:05:21.030> off<00:05:21.270> here<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.600> just

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
you tick the sheath off here it just

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.570 
you tick the sheath off here it just
goes<00:05:21.900> down<00:05:22.139> it<00:05:22.410> comes<00:05:22.500> right<00:05:22.740> back<00:05:22.919> up<00:05:22.979> it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
goes down it comes right back up it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.520 
goes down it comes right back up it
doesn't<00:05:23.850> go<00:05:23.940> down<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.419> stator<00:05:24.690> for

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.100 
doesn't go down to the stator for
anything<00:05:25.740> for<00:05:26.460> any<00:05:26.610> connections<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.419> so<00:05:28.020> in

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
anything for any connections so so in

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.990 
anything for any connections so so in
this<00:05:28.169> particular<00:05:28.350> state<00:05:29.280> if<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.580> checked<00:05:29.880> it

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
this particular state if you checked it

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.969 
this particular state if you checked it
you'd<00:05:30.120> say<00:05:30.270> yeah<00:05:30.479> this<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.840> good<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.890> know

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
you'd say yeah this is good you know

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.790 
you'd say yeah this is good you know
there's<00:05:32.190> always<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.690> small<00:05:33.690> chance<00:05:34.169> there's

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
there's always that small chance there's

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.469 
there's always that small chance there's
a<00:05:34.860> little<00:05:35.190> bit<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.550> short<00:05:35.850> somewhere<00:05:36.150> that

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
a little bit of a short somewhere that

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.969 
a little bit of a short somewhere that
isn't<00:05:36.630> quite<00:05:36.900> showing<00:05:37.320> up<00:05:37.470> yet<00:05:37.710> when<00:05:37.890> you

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
isn't quite showing up yet when you

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.400 
isn't quite showing up yet when you
check<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.340> cold<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.570> may<00:05:39.720> only<00:05:39.960> show<00:05:40.260> up

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
check it cold and it may only show up

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.890 
check it cold and it may only show up
when<00:05:40.530> it's<00:05:40.680> warm<00:05:41.010> so<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:42.419> just<00:05:42.510> have<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.780> watch

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
when it's warm so you just have to watch

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.300 
when it's warm so you just have to watch
for<00:05:43.110> those<00:05:43.200> issues<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.680> know<00:05:43.890> check<00:05:44.100> for

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
for those issues you know check for

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.500 
for those issues you know check for
connections<00:05:44.850> make<00:05:45.060> sure<00:05:45.240> all<00:05:45.390> the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
connections make sure all the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.000 
connections make sure all the
connections<00:05:45.960> are<00:05:46.110> tight<00:05:46.380> you<00:05:46.710> know<00:05:46.800> there's

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
connections are tight you know there's

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.210 
connections are tight you know there's
nothing<00:05:47.820> clipped<00:05:48.270> or<00:05:48.479> chipped<00:05:48.930> anywhere<00:05:49.440> I've

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
nothing clipped or chipped anywhere I've

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.890 
nothing clipped or chipped anywhere I've
seen<00:05:50.520> sleds<00:05:50.820> before<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.330> can't<00:05:51.539> find<00:05:51.780> an

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
seen sleds before you can't find an

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.270 
seen sleds before you can't find an
issue<00:05:52.020> at<00:05:52.260> all<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.530> all<00:05:52.740> of<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.919> sudden<00:05:53.220> you

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
issue at all and all of a sudden you

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.610 
issue at all and all of a sudden you
look<00:05:53.520> real<00:05:53.820> close<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.930> wire<00:05:55.200> will

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
look real close and the wire will

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.469 
look real close and the wire will
actually<00:05:55.979> be<00:05:56.100> like<00:05:56.250> cut<00:05:56.550> through<00:05:56.940> right<00:05:57.450> at

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
actually be like cut through right at

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.690 
actually be like cut through right at
the<00:05:57.930> plug<00:05:58.260> and<00:05:58.590> just<00:05:58.620> you'll<00:05:59.280> never<00:05:59.520> you'd

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
the plug and just you'll never you'd

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.879 
the plug and just you'll never you'd
never<00:05:59.910> see<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:00.450> you<00:06:01.169> don't<00:06:01.289> move<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.650> plug

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
never see it you don't move the plug

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.100 
never see it you don't move the plug
enough<00:06:02.190> to<00:06:02.370> see<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.700> wire<00:06:02.910> move<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.900> know<00:06:04.020> you

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
enough to see the wire move you know you

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.500 
enough to see the wire move you know you
some<00:06:04.830> issues<00:06:05.160> like<00:06:05.370> that<00:06:05.550> I've<00:06:05.820> seen<00:06:06.330> before

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
some issues like that I've seen before

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.090 
some issues like that I've seen before
it<00:06:06.900> just<00:06:07.139> you<00:06:07.380> almost<00:06:07.560> start<00:06:07.770> pulling<00:06:08.070> your

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
it just you almost start pulling your

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.650 
it just you almost start pulling your
hair<00:06:08.370> out<00:06:08.400> because<00:06:08.820> something<00:06:09.240> is<00:06:09.330> just<00:06:09.539> not

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
hair out because something is just not

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.690 
hair out because something is just not
right<00:06:09.810> with<00:06:10.289> it<00:06:10.440> so<00:06:10.680> but<00:06:11.190> at<00:06:11.280> least<00:06:11.400> if<00:06:11.610> you

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
right with it so but at least if you

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.730 
right with it so but at least if you
measure<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.270> my<00:06:12.720> 's<00:06:12.750> you<00:06:13.470> know<00:06:13.530> if<00:06:13.620> you

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
measure it my 's you know if you

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.190 
measure it my 's you know if you
measured<00:06:14.130> it<00:06:14.280> and<00:06:14.669> it<00:06:15.330> gave<00:06:15.570> you<00:06:15.780> you<00:06:16.080> know

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
measured it and it gave you you know

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.650 
measured it and it gave you you know
zero<00:06:16.620> if<00:06:17.070> it<00:06:17.250> didn't<00:06:17.520> show<00:06:17.669> anything<00:06:17.940> then<00:06:18.510> you

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
zero if it didn't show anything then you

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.240 
zero if it didn't show anything then you
know<00:06:18.780> while<00:06:18.930> my<00:06:19.110> issue<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.530> somewhere<00:06:19.860> in<00:06:20.010> here

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
know while my issue is somewhere in here

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.370 
know while my issue is somewhere in here
so<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.520> just<00:06:20.550> check<00:06:20.970> your<00:06:21.150> wires<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:21.780> you

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
so you just check your wires and you

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.650 
so you just check your wires and you
know<00:06:22.470> look<00:06:22.710> for<00:06:22.889> loose<00:06:23.010> broken<00:06:23.460> wires<00:06:23.669> so<00:06:24.030> but

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
know look for loose broken wires so but

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.000 
know look for loose broken wires so but
that's<00:06:24.810> how<00:06:24.930> you<00:06:24.960> check<00:06:25.350> this<00:06:25.620> particular

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
that's how you check this particular

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.490 
that's how you check this particular
stator<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:26.910> those<00:06:27.419> are<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.600> own<00:06:27.720> values<00:06:28.289> on

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
stator and those are the own values on

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.310 
stator and those are the own values on
readings<00:06:28.919> thank<00:06:29.190> you
