00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.800 

so<00:00:16.180> I<00:00:16.539> fish<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> lot<00:00:17.650> of<00:00:17.770> offshore<00:00:18.100> lately<00:00:18.490> and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so I fish a lot of offshore lately and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.940 
so I fish a lot of offshore lately and
efficient<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.840> lot<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:20.080> brush<00:00:20.260> piles<00:00:20.560> and<00:00:20.830> one

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
efficient a lot of brush piles and one

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.800 
efficient a lot of brush piles and one
of<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.130> biggest<00:00:21.280> things<00:00:21.610> involved<00:00:22.330> when<00:00:22.690> it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
of the biggest things involved when it

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.420 
of the biggest things involved when it
comes<00:00:23.020> to<00:00:23.140> offshore<00:00:23.260> fishing<00:00:23.710> is<00:00:24.010> it's<00:00:24.310> really

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
comes to offshore fishing is it's really

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.340 
comes to offshore fishing is it's really
seeing<00:00:24.850> the<00:00:25.060> fish<00:00:25.270> and<00:00:25.630> then<00:00:25.750> catching<00:00:26.260> them

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
seeing the fish and then catching them

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
seeing the fish and then catching them
and<00:00:26.500> that's<00:00:26.620> really<00:00:26.800> what<00:00:26.980> keeps<00:00:27.160> you<00:00:27.340> going

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 
and that's really what keeps you going

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.940 
and that's really what keeps you going
it's<00:00:27.880> not<00:00:28.000> so<00:00:28.210> much<00:00:28.420> you<00:00:28.990> know<00:00:29.080> probing<00:00:29.590> areas

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
it's not so much you know probing areas

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.710 
it's not so much you know probing areas
and<00:00:30.160> that<00:00:30.310> it's<00:00:30.700> really<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.180> way<00:00:31.300> I<00:00:31.330> like<00:00:31.690> to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
and that it's really the way I like to

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.110 
and that it's really the way I like to
do<00:00:31.960> is<00:00:32.169> I<00:00:32.259> like<00:00:32.289> the<00:00:32.619> same<00:00:32.860> you<00:00:33.190> catch<00:00:33.399> on<00:00:33.579> so<00:00:34.089> I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
do is I like the same you catch on so I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.759 
do is I like the same you catch on so I
got<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.329> new<00:00:34.510> little<00:00:34.690> product<00:00:35.409> that<00:00:35.589> i'm<00:00:35.679> going

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
got a new little product that i'm going

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.040 
got a new little product that i'm going
to<00:00:35.859> try<00:00:36.070> got<00:00:36.429> this<00:00:36.579> way<00:00:36.850> that<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.149> figured<00:00:37.929> out

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
to try got this way that I figured out

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.500 
to try got this way that I figured out
how<00:00:38.199> to<00:00:38.260> ring<00:00:38.559> it<00:00:38.710> up<00:00:38.859> it's<00:00:39.730> called<00:00:39.909> the<00:00:40.030> deeper

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
how to ring it up it's called the deeper

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.059 
how to ring it up it's called the deeper
and<00:00:40.719> it's<00:00:40.839> actually<00:00:40.960> it's<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.289> solar<00:00:41.649> module

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
and it's actually it's a solar module

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:44.669 
and it's actually it's a solar module
that<00:00:42.280> floats<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.989> got<00:00:44.319> some<00:00:44.499> busts<00:00:44.649> balls

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679 
that floats and I got some busts balls

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.009 
that floats and I got some busts balls
coming<00:00:45.399> up<00:00:45.489> right<00:00:45.729> here<00:00:46.120> what<00:00:46.659> I'm<00:00:46.780> going<00:00:46.839> to

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
coming up right here what I'm going to

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.079 
coming up right here what I'm going to
do<00:00:47.199> is<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:47.530> raked<00:00:47.769> up<00:00:47.920> this<00:00:48.129> kind<00:00:48.519> of<00:00:48.579> cool<00:00:48.789> rig

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
do is I raked up this kind of cool rig

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.779 
do is I raked up this kind of cool rig
where<00:00:49.659> I<00:00:49.690> can<00:00:49.989> clip<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.440> on<00:00:50.679> our<00:00:50.829> module<00:00:51.339> to

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
where I can clip this on our module to

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.819 
where I can clip this on our module to
one<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.120> my<00:00:52.210> marker<00:00:52.600> buoys<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.170> set<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.739> over

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
one of my marker buoys and set it over

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.919 
one of my marker buoys and set it over
the<00:00:54.039> brush<00:00:54.219> pile<00:00:54.489> back<00:00:54.940> off<00:00:55.179> the<00:00:55.329> brush<00:00:55.510> pollen

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
the brush pile back off the brush pollen

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.079 
the brush pile back off the brush pollen
fish<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.620> have<00:00:57.069> a<00:00:57.100> real-time<00:00:57.579> image<00:00:57.940> of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
fish it and have a real-time image of

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.849 
fish it and have a real-time image of
what<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.420> fish<00:00:58.600> are<00:00:58.780> doing<00:00:59.109> are<00:00:59.350> they<00:00:59.589> still

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
what the fish are doing are they still

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.619 
what the fish are doing are they still
there<00:00:59.920> are<00:01:00.519> they<00:01:00.729> moving<00:01:00.909> around<00:01:01.269> did<00:01:01.600> a

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
there are they moving around did a

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.450 
there are they moving around did a
bigger<00:01:01.870> fish<00:01:02.139> move<00:01:02.409> up<00:01:02.620> so<00:01:03.129> we're<00:01:03.280> going<00:01:03.370> to

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
bigger fish move up so we're going to

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.920 
bigger fish move up so we're going to
give<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.729> try<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:03.999> my<00:01:04.299> first<00:01:04.479> time<00:01:04.659> trying

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
give it a try this my first time trying

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.270 
give it a try this my first time trying
it<00:01:05.170> out<00:01:05.320> but<00:01:05.680> I<00:01:05.710> think<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:05.980> going<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.130> be<00:01:06.190> a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
it out but I think it's going to be a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.860 
it out but I think it's going to be a
great<00:01:06.490> tool<00:01:06.730> for<00:01:06.790> doing<00:01:07.480> some<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.810> this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
great tool for doing some of this

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.630 
great tool for doing some of this
offshore<00:01:08.110> stuff<00:01:08.620> when<00:01:08.800> it<00:01:08.830> comes<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.250> brush

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
offshore stuff when it comes to brush

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.210 
offshore stuff when it comes to brush
and<00:01:10.110> isolated<00:01:11.110> kind<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.440> structure<00:01:11.860> fishing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
and isolated kind of structure fishing

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.060 
and isolated kind of structure fishing
offshore<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.630> this<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.170> my<00:01:14.290> deeper<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.040> a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
offshore so this is my deeper this is a

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.570 
offshore so this is my deeper this is a
holding<00:01:15.400> site<00:01:15.640> for<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.410> this<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:17.650> deeper

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
holding site for it and this is deeper

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.850 
holding site for it and this is deeper
basically<00:01:19.510> it's<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.140> waterproof<00:01:20.680> house

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
basically it's a waterproof house

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.980 
basically it's a waterproof house
transducer<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.730> what<00:01:22.330> I'm<00:01:22.420> going<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.600> do<00:01:22.750> with

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
transducer and what I'm going to do with

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.770 
transducer and what I'm going to do with
it<00:01:23.230> is<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:24.010> allows<00:01:24.250> me<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.610> use<00:01:24.640> my<00:01:24.760> phone<00:01:25.300> using

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
it is it allows me to use my phone using

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.200 
it is it allows me to use my phone using
a<00:01:25.960> Bluetooth<00:01:26.320> connection<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.610> basically<00:01:27.910> see

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
a Bluetooth connection to basically see

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.180 
a Bluetooth connection to basically see
it<00:01:28.270> when<00:01:28.900> it's<00:01:29.080> off<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.560> boat<00:01:29.710> on<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.040> way

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
it when it's off the boat on the way

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.430 
it when it's off the boat on the way
from<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.550> so<00:01:31.000> what<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.180> did<00:01:31.540> like<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.140> said<00:01:32.200> I'm

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
from it so what I did like I said I'm

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.780 
from it so what I did like I said I'm
efficient<00:01:32.800> brush<00:01:32.950> piles<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.460> want<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.700> know

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
efficient brush piles I want to know

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.700 
efficient brush piles I want to know
what's<00:01:34.060> going<00:01:34.510> on<00:01:34.630> when<00:01:34.960> I'm<00:01:35.080> off<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.560> brush

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
what's going on when I'm off the brush

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.620 
what's going on when I'm off the brush
pile<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.280> my<00:01:36.460> regular<00:01:37.000> showing<00:01:37.240> or<00:01:37.390> can't

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
pile and my regular showing or can't

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.230 
pile and my regular showing or can't
scan<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:38.680> rigged<00:01:38.920> up<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.250> buoy<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:40.000> I

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
scan it so I rigged up this buoy and I

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.810 
scan it so I rigged up this buoy and I
took<00:01:40.300> an<00:01:40.660> ice<00:01:40.900> crew<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:42.280> little<00:01:42.520> piece<00:01:42.640> of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
took an ice crew and a little piece of

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.820 
took an ice crew and a little piece of
30<00:01:43.030> pound<00:01:43.270> mano<00:01:43.540> with<00:01:43.810> some<00:01:43.990> clips<00:01:44.260> on<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.650> and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
30 pound mano with some clips on it and

30 pound mano with some clips on it and
the<00:01:45.490> deeper<00:01:45.670> has<00:01:46.060> these<00:01:46.330> ringlets<00:01:46.900> that<00:01:47.200> you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
the deeper has these ringlets that you

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.840 
the deeper has these ringlets that you
can<00:01:47.470> choose<00:01:47.680> either<00:01:47.920> one<00:01:48.070> on<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.400> top<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.760> one

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
on the side in this situation i'm going

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.530 
on the side in this situation i'm going
to<00:01:51.160> use<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.400> one<00:01:51.580> on<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.820> side<00:01:52.030> because<00:01:52.480> i

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
to use the one on the side because i

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.940 
to use the one on the side because i
want<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.930> drift<00:01:53.170> just<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.440> little<00:01:53.680> bit<00:01:53.800> off

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
want it to drift just a little bit off

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.130 
want it to drift just a little bit off
the<00:01:54.130> buoy<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.550> order<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.880> scan<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.900> i'm<00:01:56.050> going

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
the buoy in order to scan and i'm going

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.100 
the buoy in order to scan and i'm going
to<00:01:56.230> use<00:01:56.410> my<00:01:56.440> clip<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.610> i'm<00:01:57.730> just<00:01:57.909> going<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.240> put

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
to use my clip and i'm just going to put

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.790 
to use my clip and i'm just going to put
the<00:01:59.200> clip<00:01:59.380> on<00:01:59.560> there

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
the clip on there

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.300 
the clip on there
close<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.700> clip<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:04.010> going<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.160> go<00:02:04.280> find

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
close the clip and I'm going to go find

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.430 
close the clip and I'm going to go find
my<00:02:04.640> brush<00:02:04.940> pile<00:02:05.180> drop<00:02:05.690> it<00:02:05.840> right<00:02:05.960> next<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.410> it

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
my brush pile drop it right next to it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.230 
my brush pile drop it right next to it
and<00:02:06.560> I'm<00:02:06.770> getting<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.130> real-time<00:02:07.580> picture<00:02:08.090> of

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
and I'm getting a real-time picture of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.359 
and I'm getting a real-time picture of
what's<00:02:08.570> happening<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.290> pile<00:02:09.560> as<00:02:09.860> I'm

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
what's happening on that pile as I'm

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.040 
what's happening on that pile as I'm
fishing<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.420> should<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.570> pretty<00:02:11.780> cool

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
fishing it so this should be pretty cool

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.800 
fishing it so this should be pretty cool
let's<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.710> how<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.860> works<00:02:12.980> alright<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.270> I'm

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
let's see how it works alright so I'm

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.870 
let's see how it works alright so I'm
coming<00:02:15.320> up<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.500> my<00:02:15.560> brush<00:02:15.800> pile<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.580> what<00:02:16.790> I'm

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
coming up to my brush pile and what I'm

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
coming up to my brush pile and what I'm
going<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.480> actually<00:02:17.600> going<00:02:17.840> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
going to do is I'm actually going to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.900 
going to do is I'm actually going to
drop<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.320> buoy<00:02:18.470> down<00:02:18.740> there<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:19.760> I'm

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
drop the buoy down there and then I'm

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.370 
drop the buoy down there and then I'm
going<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.060> come<00:02:20.240> back<00:02:20.300> soon<00:02:20.840> as<00:02:20.930> my<00:02:21.020> buoys<00:02:21.350> down

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
going to come back soon as my buoys down

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.860 
going to come back soon as my buoys down
I'm<00:02:22.070> gonna<00:02:22.190> go<00:02:22.370> ahead<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.550> clip<00:02:23.030> my<00:02:23.390> deeper

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
I'm gonna go ahead and clip my deeper

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.140 
I'm gonna go ahead and clip my deeper
using<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.830> clipping<00:02:25.190> mechanism<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.850> showed

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
using the clipping mechanism that showed

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.180 
using the clipping mechanism that showed
you<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:27.050> side<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> buoy<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.070> going

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
you the side of the buoy and it's going

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.800 
you the side of the buoy and it's going
to<00:02:28.250> give<00:02:28.400> me<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.550> real-time<00:02:29.000> image<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.510> what's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
to give me a real-time image of what's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.600 
to give me a real-time image of what's
happening<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.500> brush<00:02:30.770> pile<00:02:31.040> at<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
happening on that brush pile at that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.250 
happening on that brush pile at that
very<00:02:31.820> moment<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.540> we're<00:02:32.660> going<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> pull<00:02:33.020> up

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
very moment so we're going to pull up

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
very moment so we're going to pull up
and<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.070> just<00:02:34.310> kind<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.520> liquid<00:02:34.730> normally

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and do it just kind of liquid normally

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.760 
and do it just kind of liquid normally
do<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.390> put<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.780> blue<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.080> right<00:02:36.320> next<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
do it put the blue it right next to the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.200 
do it put the blue it right next to the
brush<00:02:36.950> pile<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.460> we<00:02:37.580> got<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> good<00:02:37.910> idea<00:02:38.030> of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
brush pile so we got a good idea of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.520 
brush pile so we got a good idea of
where<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.630> here<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:38.960> coming<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.320> right

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
where it is here it's coming up right

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.040 
where it is here it's coming up right
here<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.940> I'm<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.180> go<00:02:41.300> ahead<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.660> drop<00:02:41.990> a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
here so I'm going to go ahead and drop a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.050 
here so I'm going to go ahead and drop a
buoy<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.070> get<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.220> lined<00:02:43.460> up<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.910> hook

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
buoy on it and get it lined up and hook

00:02:44.060 --> 00:03:04.510 
buoy on it and get it lined up and hook
the<00:02:44.210> deeper<00:02:44.510> up<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.870> it

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.790 

so<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.180> got<00:03:05.390> deeper<00:03:05.780> connected<00:03:06.260> out<00:03:06.380> here<00:03:06.650> and

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
so I got deeper connected out here and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.530 
so I got deeper connected out here and
I've<00:03:06.890> connected<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.520> my<00:03:07.700> on<00:03:07.910> my<00:03:07.940> phone<00:03:08.330> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
I've connected it on my on my phone and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.420 
I've connected it on my on my phone and
basically<00:03:09.020> deeper<00:03:09.860> connects<00:03:10.190> buy<00:03:10.400> a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
basically deeper connects buy a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.820 
basically deeper connects buy a
bluetooth<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.840> creates<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.170> connection<00:03:12.320> or

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
bluetooth and it creates a connection or

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.730 
bluetooth and it creates a connection or
a<00:03:12.890> network<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:14.810> module<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
a network with the module with the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.530 
a network with the module with the
transducer<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:16.580> then<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.240> gives<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.510> a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
transducer and then it gives you a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.210 
transducer and then it gives you a
real-time<00:03:17.810> scan<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.500> what's<00:03:18.650> happening<00:03:18.980> over

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
real-time scan of what's happening over

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.710 
real-time scan of what's happening over
there<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.640> can<00:03:19.790> see<00:03:19.820> there's<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.240> couple<00:03:20.420> fish

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
there you can see there's a couple fish

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440 
there you can see there's a couple fish
moving<00:03:21.050> around<00:03:21.290> down<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.740> about<00:03:22.070> 15<00:03:22.970> foot<00:03:23.300> or

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
moving around down in about 15 foot or

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.040 
moving around down in about 15 foot or
so<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.930> basically<00:03:24.920> I'm<00:03:25.280> not<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.910> top<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.480> so

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
so and basically I'm not on top of it so

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.690 
so and basically I'm not on top of it so
I<00:03:27.080> can't<00:03:27.470> exactly<00:03:27.560> see<00:03:28.040> what's<00:03:28.190> going<00:03:28.430> on<00:03:28.520> on

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
I can't exactly see what's going on on

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.220 
I can't exactly see what's going on on
my<00:03:28.790> regular<00:03:29.000> graph<00:03:29.390> but<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:29.810> gives<00:03:29.930> me<00:03:30.080> an

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
my regular graph but this gives me an

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.630 
my regular graph but this gives me an
idea<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.740> there's<00:03:30.920> definitely<00:03:31.430> some

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
idea that there's definitely some

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.190 
idea that there's definitely some
activity<00:03:32.150> down<00:03:32.300> there<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.750> there's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
activity down there and there's

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.870 
activity down there and there's
definitely<00:03:33.590> something<00:03:33.920> going<00:03:33.950> on<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.850> I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
definitely something going on so I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.730 
definitely something going on so I
definitely<00:03:35.450> want<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> pick<00:03:36.020> up<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.260> rods<00:03:36.440> for

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
definitely want to pick up a rods for

00:03:36.740 --> 00:04:21.310 
definitely want to pick up a rods for
fishing<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.310> let's<00:03:37.520> see<00:03:37.640> what<00:03:37.790> happens

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:40.099 

you

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:40.109 

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:45.469 

I<00:04:41.429> saw<00:04:42.429> before<00:04:43.089> I<00:04:43.359> called<00:04:43.839> her<00:04:44.049> babe<00:04:44.259> come<00:04:45.039> here

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
I saw before I called her babe come here

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.820 
I saw before I called her babe come here
come<00:04:46.479> here

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.640 

using<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.730> deeper<00:04:52.150> fishing<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.050> real<00:04:53.290> time

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
using the deeper fishing in real time

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.950 
using the deeper fishing in real time
watching<00:04:54.340> my<00:04:54.490> pile<00:04:54.730> seeing<00:04:55.240> what's<00:04:55.450> going<00:04:55.780> on

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
watching my pile seeing what's going on

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.380 
watching my pile seeing what's going on
being<00:04:56.590> aware<00:04:56.890> of<00:04:56.950> what's<00:04:57.250> going<00:04:57.370> on<00:04:57.730> and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
being aware of what's going on and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.650 
being aware of what's going on and
catching<00:04:58.810> chunks<00:04:59.200> baby<00:04:59.440> i<00:04:59.860> like<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.520> it's<00:05:01.420> let

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
catching chunks baby i like it it's let

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.149 
catching chunks baby i like it it's let
her<00:05:01.750> go<00:05:01.960> good

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.950 

so<00:05:07.159> that's<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.460> deeper<00:05:07.789> guys<00:05:07.969> what's<00:05:08.810> great

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
so that's the deeper guys what's great

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.809 
so that's the deeper guys what's great
about<00:05:09.050> is<00:05:09.439> it's<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:09.860> simple<00:05:10.159> to<00:05:10.280> use<00:05:10.400> and

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
about is it's so simple to use and

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.999 
about is it's so simple to use and
there's<00:05:11.479> a<00:05:11.539> lot<00:05:11.659> of<00:05:11.719> creative<00:05:12.139> options<00:05:12.409> that

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
there's a lot of creative options that

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.739 
there's a lot of creative options that
that<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.490> can<00:05:13.669> implement<00:05:13.789> using<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.599> just

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:14.749 
that you can implement using it just

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.600 
that you can implement using it just
like<00:05:15.169> I<00:05:15.289> took<00:05:15.349> it<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:15.949> put<00:05:16.009> it<00:05:16.189> next<00:05:16.279> to<00:05:16.490> these

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
like I took it and put it next to these

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.640 
like I took it and put it next to these
brush<00:05:16.879> piles<00:05:16.909> to<00:05:17.449> see<00:05:17.629> when<00:05:18.110> I'm<00:05:18.259> starting<00:05:18.590> to

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
brush piles to see when I'm starting to

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.140 
brush piles to see when I'm starting to
waste<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:19.009> my<00:05:19.069> time<00:05:19.279> when<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.699> fish<00:05:19.849> kind<00:05:20.029> of

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
waste of my time when the fish kind of

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.209 
waste of my time when the fish kind of
dissipating<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.289> gives<00:05:21.529> me<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> real<00:05:21.979> time

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
dissipating that it gives me a real time

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.360 
dissipating that it gives me a real time
vision<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:22.819> what<00:05:23.150> I'm<00:05:23.300> actually<00:05:23.509> fishing<00:05:23.990> and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
vision of what I'm actually fishing and

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.309 
vision of what I'm actually fishing and
it's<00:05:25.370> so<00:05:25.639> easy<00:05:25.849> because<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:26.449> got<00:05:26.599> my<00:05:26.749> phone<00:05:26.960> I

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
it's so easy because I got my phone I

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.350 
it's so easy because I got my phone I
have<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.860> with<00:05:27.979> me<00:05:28.159> all<00:05:28.279> the<00:05:28.430> time<00:05:28.460> all<00:05:29.029> I<00:05:29.120> got

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
have it with me all the time all I got

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360 
have it with me all the time all I got
to<00:05:29.479> do<00:05:29.629> is<00:05:29.779> connect<00:05:30.139> using<00:05:30.349> bluetooth<00:05:30.889> connect

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
to do is connect using bluetooth connect

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.129 
to do is connect using bluetooth connect
to<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.610> transducer<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:32.569> can<00:05:32.719> see<00:05:32.900> what's

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
to the transducer and I can see what's

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.659 
to the transducer and I can see what's
going<00:05:33.229> on<00:05:33.590> you<00:05:34.159> know<00:05:34.279> there's<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.490> lot<00:05:34.639> of

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
going on you know there's a lot of

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.790 
going on you know there's a lot of
creative<00:05:35.090> ways<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.330> use<00:05:35.629> it<00:05:35.810> I<00:05:35.930> think<00:05:36.229> it's<00:05:36.710> a

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
creative ways to use it I think it's a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.019 
creative ways to use it I think it's a
newer<00:05:36.949> product<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.550> we're<00:05:37.699> just<00:05:37.729> scratching

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
newer product so we're just scratching

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.790 
newer product so we're just scratching
the<00:05:38.360> surface<00:05:38.449> of<00:05:38.930> what<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.229> can<00:05:39.379> do<00:05:39.469> with<00:05:39.620> it

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
the surface of what you can do with it

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.860 
the surface of what you can do with it
but<00:05:40.340> when<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.520> comes<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:40.879> saltwater<00:05:41.300> fishing

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
but when it comes to saltwater fishing

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.420 
but when it comes to saltwater fishing
if<00:05:41.990> you're<00:05:42.110> chumming<00:05:42.319> offshore<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.189> you<00:05:43.279> need

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
if you're chumming offshore and you need

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.249 
if you're chumming offshore and you need
something<00:05:43.759> over<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.029> that<00:05:44.449> Chum<00:05:44.840> cloud<00:05:45.080> that

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
something over that that Chum cloud that

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.719 
something over that that Chum cloud that
you're<00:05:45.439> creating<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:46.039> mean<00:05:46.400> if<00:05:46.490> you're<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:46.699> the

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
you're creating I mean if you're on the

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.490 
you're creating I mean if you're on the
bank<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.449> you<00:05:47.659> just<00:05:47.810> want<00:05:48.020> to<00:05:48.080> see<00:05:48.229> what

bank and you just want to see what

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.170 
bank and you just want to see what
you're<00:05:48.710> actually<00:05:48.889> fishing<00:05:49.340> for<00:05:49.669> a<00:05:49.699> change<00:05:50.029> and

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
you're actually fishing for a change and

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.369 
you're actually fishing for a change and
you<00:05:50.300> want<00:05:50.449> to<00:05:50.509> cast<00:05:50.689> it<00:05:50.840> out<00:05:50.960> there<00:05:51.169> on<00:05:51.289> the

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
you want to cast it out there on the

you want to cast it out there on the
sparrow<00:05:51.680> rod<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:52.550> know<00:05:52.669> it's<00:05:53.330> mobility<00:05:53.840> is

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
sparrow rod you know it's mobility is

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.350 
sparrow rod you know it's mobility is
its<00:05:54.409> power<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:55.099> can<00:05:55.340> go<00:05:55.490> anywhere<00:05:55.520> it<00:05:56.120> can<00:05:56.150> go

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
its power it can go anywhere it can go

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.089 
its power it can go anywhere it can go
places<00:05:56.599> where<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.139> can't<00:05:57.409> be<00:05:57.589> or<00:05:57.740> your<00:05:57.889> boat

can<00:05:58.310> be<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.669> that<00:05:59.180> really<00:05:59.330> empowers<00:05:59.779> you<00:05:59.900> to

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
can be and that really empowers you to

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.540 
can be and that really empowers you to
see<00:06:00.139> what's<00:06:00.379> going<00:06:00.620> on<00:06:00.710> underwater<00:06:01.009> and<00:06:01.460> it's

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
see what's going on underwater and it's

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.100 
see what's going on underwater and it's
going<00:06:01.699> to<00:06:01.759> catch<00:06:01.879> you<00:06:02.029> some<00:06:02.180> more<00:06:02.330> fish<00:06:02.569> but

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
going to catch you some more fish but

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.329 
going to catch you some more fish but
give<00:06:03.229> it<00:06:03.259> a<00:06:03.409> try<00:06:03.589> if<00:06:03.740> you<00:06:03.830> figure<00:06:04.069> out<00:06:04.099> some

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
give it a try if you figure out some
