00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.419
 Welcome north on the lawn 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.099
 my name light in hipólito who will speak to them necessary that finally is not 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.769
 he gives it more attention I think it's indispensable in the workflow 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:33.800
 digital 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.460
 I mean the memory card reader or said in English 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.780
 lanes 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.620
 All digital cameras include a cable to connect to the computer 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 stepped hard to download files 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.520
 but in a real workflow connect the computer camera to 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 download photos and impractical mainly 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 because if you do not use the camera during the process 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.310
 then to leave my pictures with your memory card reader is 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.880
 a small and economic accessory lina garcía standard of brands and models 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.539
 there are for one or several types of memory cards 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.100
 with head without cables 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.870
 and what variety of shapes sizes and colors 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.479
 the vast majority works as a Westerwelle lesson 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.570
 and generally does not need any software installation 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.320
 it only connects to the computer and it recognizes it immediately 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.979
 I have two cameras that use different cards 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.040
 and for this reason I have readers 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.719
 a work memories points more 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.170
 and another one for sd memories 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.870
 and because it is a vital accessory and economic alavés I have where each one 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.360
 if it was damaged 1 just kept working with the other one anyway 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 They are very reliable accessories I never got damaged but a little bit of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.790
 Prevention never hurts 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.570
 then and for the reasons stated above 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.929
 the lane in areas to be indispensable 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.269
 that must not be missing in the arsenal of every digital photographer 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.730
 that's all for today thanks for joining me 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.410
 I'm looking hipolito and now I say goodbye and we do not see in the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.610
 next
