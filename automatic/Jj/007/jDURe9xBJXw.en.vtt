00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello before i start improving 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.379
 moped brakes 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.080
 they even say not to improve but just 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.170
 bring them back to normal i 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.190
 in general, let me show you what we are dealing with. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 now the country is behind installed and mobile 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:28.849
 and front rear assembled and fully 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.849
 take still works at here so here 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 pressed lever do not lead 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.390
 front wheel the same rear 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 quality push the lever 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 he blocks who is when and here by 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.360
 room layout is still clear that some 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.570
 base presence are present but 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.610
 inhibited through sleep Kontrov hour not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.610
 it will turn out that there are no brakes 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.680
 remembered pressed levers and the wheels are not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.780
 are blocked 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.780
 then compare with what you get in the end 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.780
 so before proceeding to the treatment 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 block fractional composition I would strongly 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.550
 recommended almost everything here too 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.100
 axis greed as far as possible there 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.140
 mop polish thats and every 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.550
 pads need this iron 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.040
 epoxy glue plate 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.070
 and so do not regret the glue to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.140
 plate kstovo hard here bears 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.610
 finished block means here 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 the block is not processed yet 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.950
 mean before and handle 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.140
 it is necessary to cut transverse grooves 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 on each pad depth 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.330
 there a couple of tenths are cut it here 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.729
 so here are the prints with the disk 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.650
 what does rosin mean there 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.030
 646 solvent is poured it all 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.950
 long insisted stirred started 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.990
 rosin dissolves very well 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.820
 help heat the water bath 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.240
 then simply that means solution 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.489
 rosin 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.160
 solvent 646 takes with a brush 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.459
 Smear on the shoe means to smear 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.709
 several times you can dry it all 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.680
 as a result, we will get very 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 powerful fractional composition of which 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.100
 practically 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.250
 this method will immediately slow down 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.310
 verified means the functionality of these here 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.180
 grooves not only that it stores 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.190
 then he himself is this rosin dry 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.870
 the form but also in this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.170
 slicing it allows better pads 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.420
 get used to the drum and the drum is better 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.400
 capture from the block I do not know how much 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.350
 it is all justified scientifically but in practice 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.200
 slicing these canal which is heaven and earth 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.459
 how honor pads of course there is more 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.050
 modern pads with normal 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.000
 fractional coating they do not require 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.100
 such an operation but we have a Soviet 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.350
 wells which in general is originally 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.410
 It slows down so this is a simple 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.830
 the operation of cutting channel kai namaz not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.520
 with rosin she is very much change this 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.860
 degree but intensity of inhibition 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:22.410
 just try not to spoil yourself in 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.900
 make sure everyone is so good brakes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.410
 Modified assembled as you can see here 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.660
 no tricks double eccentrics and 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.150
 nothing else, it means if the pads are not 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.220
 fit the drum closely something else 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.440
 such a transition sleeve is used but 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.210
 here is putting on tesla not a patriot 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.020
 short to normal condition they 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.340
 the drum is fine 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.930
 so I wanted to say what 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.780
 stop the problems of these pads in that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.180
 that one eccentric they divorce 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.040
 so if this edge is allowed here 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.790
 This pads are captured by the drum and and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.810
 dash and then this edge is ridden 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.990
 pushed drum turns 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.630
 brakes one block and to 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.670
 she began to seize the second block 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.530
 it is necessary to bring this lower edge 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.040
 he brings the drum close by 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.590
 such a sleeve here is not required 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.540
 still okay to this myself 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.919
 the drum is just about physio not 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.959
 contributes to the fact that the drum 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.880
 captures this shoe from here this 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.250
 block away that is so here Barova 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.140
 It rotates the drum and they are both very very 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.590
 tightened up and so it turns out 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.770
 that with minimal effort on the lever 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 the brakes are as effective as possible 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.730
 well 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.950
 Front brake is ready completely for already with 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.700
 modifications now I will demonstrate how 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.700
 it all works 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.730
 reinforced case is much smaller i.e. 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.650
 grabs the brake almost immediately and 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.620
 when he starts to grab the lever 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.330
 leaves with a short pressed or 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.330
 there is a myrtle lock you see 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.690
 first perceptions of us somehow 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.560
 be careful not everyone will show 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.380
 grind because as they help 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.240
 fresh will slow down very well 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.240
 You can even fly to the Internet 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.280
 instantly and then 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.620
 predictably lock somehow 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.360
 Separate deceleration diameter 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.360
 literally braking goodies 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:43.330
 there will be a lock if the tire is 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.680
 applied to something it is possible that she 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.880
 can turn so sharp 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:53.700
 braking on you see on kashirsky of 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:57.610
 and now the same thing to be done 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.840
 back the same operation and show 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:05.650
 now how does the pen handle us 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.370
 we get what everyone wanted 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.590
 it turned out that now we have 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.800
 feather bed brake right on the right handle 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.340
 for this it was necessary to turn the brake 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.580
 shield on this rearranged feathers on here 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.000
 now everything is decorated with wooden brass 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.110
 The pens 2 frames here are caps and 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.940
 brass nuts here tip in the steering wheel 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.860
 exactly the size of the cable it did not because 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.100
 that if the cable is already on this 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.080
 radio operator pinches here very much because he 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.030
 our shell is already stretched that is 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.770
 if from hard to frame what is worth 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.110
 then you then lever and live now 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.120
 what acceptable efforts of course when 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.310
 inverse well with the classical statement 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.930
 handle less effort but here how 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.780
 says style and style 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.340
 hotel know get gas trigger sooner 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.930
 all will point to the fingers and 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.880
 it seemed so convenient to me to press 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.250
 thousands under your thumb not to your liking 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.440
 the system will probably have a role to drill 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.639
 under another cable once all the whole track 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.820
 inside went well and in general, here it is 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:14.110
 Here's the detail, it will be the same on 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:18.000
 this very left of the steering wheel but until 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.000
 today it's all thank you for your attention
