00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
seen the zing commercial that footage is
really<00:01:07.710> dynamic<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
really dynamic because of all the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.690 
really dynamic because of all the
different<00:01:09.390> ways<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
different ways that that can go down and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330 
different ways that that can go down and
then<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.540> decide<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> team<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> me<00:01:13.799> here

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
then they decide to team up on me here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.200 
then they decide to team up on me here
which<00:01:14.520> wasn't<00:01:14.970> particularly<00:01:15.869> fair<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
which wasn't particularly fair so I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.810 
which wasn't particularly fair so I
switched<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> hammer<00:01:19.560> shots<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.610> can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
switched to hammer shots so that I can

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.800 
switched to hammer shots so that I can
shoot<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.270> both<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> same<00:01:22.170> time<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
shoot them both at the same time and the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
shoot them both at the same time and the
Thunder<00:01:25.170> bow<00:01:25.350> doesn't<00:01:25.740> hold<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
Thunder bow doesn't hold up and the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
Thunder bow doesn't hold up and the
draculina<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> trying<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.869> hard<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.200> fire<00:01:28.409> but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
draculina is trying so hard to fire but

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.520 
draculina is trying so hard to fire but
her<00:01:28.979> clip<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> jammed<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.720> she<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.320> gets

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
her clip is jammed so she just gets

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
her clip is jammed so she just gets
drilled<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.640> couple<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:33.090> times<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.659> hammer

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
drilled a couple of times with hammer

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
drilled a couple of times with hammer
shots<00:01:36.799> then<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:38.250> trying<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> remember<00:01:38.970> what's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
I'm very impressed by my video goggles
they<00:01:47.009> did<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> good<00:01:47.369> job<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.850> picking<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.390> some

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
they did a good job of picking up some

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
they did a good job of picking up some
of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.780> lighting<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> mini

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
of the lighting here and so the mini

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
of the lighting here and so the mini
Drake<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.880> hiding<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.509> grabbed<00:01:51.780> him<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
Drake is hiding and I grabbed him as I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.120 
Drake is hiding and I grabbed him as I
come<00:01:52.530> around<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> corner<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:55.130> double

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
come around the corner and then I double

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.050 
come around the corner and then I double
tap<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.640> why<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:59.369> draculina<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
tap because why not and the draculina is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.389 
tap because why not and the draculina is
gone<00:02:00.329> she<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.020> fast<00:02:01.350> she's<00:02:01.829> already<00:02:02.100> down

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
gone she is so fast she's already down

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.640 
gone she is so fast she's already down
the<00:02:02.579> tunnel<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> away

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
the tunnel and away

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.980 
the tunnel and away
and<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.610> think<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:06.060> pursue<00:02:06.540> her<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:06.900> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and so I think that I pursue her and I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.630 
and so I think that I pursue her and I
cut<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.410> small<00:02:07.800> clip<00:02:08.070> here<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.580> was

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
cut out a small clip here because it was

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.280 
cut out a small clip here because it was
just<00:02:08.820> me<00:02:09.000> running<00:02:09.180> trying<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.780> find<00:02:10.050> her<00:02:10.170> in

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
just me running trying to find her in

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.720 
just me running trying to find her in
that<00:02:10.440> dark<00:02:10.740> area<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.250> back<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that dark area in the back and you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.690 
that dark area in the back and you
couldn't<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.120> anything<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.670> eventually<00:02:14.670> I

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
couldn't see anything and eventually I

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.510 
couldn't see anything and eventually I
catch<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.240> her<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.810> she<00:02:16.770> ends<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.340> getting

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
catch up to her and she ends up getting

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.300 
catch up to her and she ends up getting
