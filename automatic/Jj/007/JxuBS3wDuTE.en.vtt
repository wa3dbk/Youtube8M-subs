really the Guru's of surface enhancement

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.359 
really the Guru's of surface enhancement
I<00:00:15.210> always<00:00:15.420> tell<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.619> way<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.340> I

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I always tell you that way and when I

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.500 
I always tell you that way and when I
think<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.180> surface

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
think of that I think of surface

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.300 
think of that I think of surface
enhancer<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.020> thinking<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.770> paint<00:00:20.039> we're

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
enhancer and thinking of the paint we're

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
enhancer and thinking of the paint we're
gonna<00:00:20.369> make<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> paint<00:00:20.880> surface<00:00:21.359> really<00:00:22.320> nice

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
gonna make the paint surface really nice

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
gonna make the paint surface really nice
yes<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.189> there<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.400> more<00:00:23.550> surfaces<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> car

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
yes but there are more surfaces on a car

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779 
yes but there are more surfaces on a car
than<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.590> painted<00:00:25.890> surfaces<00:00:26.279> that's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
than just the painted surfaces that's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
than just the painted surfaces that's
right<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> things<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> show

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349

all<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> pores<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.149> make<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> completely

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
all the pores in make that completely

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
all the pores in make that completely
smooth<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.430> dirt<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> contaminants<00:00:54.510> can't

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
smooth so dirt and contaminants can't

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.950 
smooth so dirt and contaminants can't
really<00:00:55.110> bond<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.890> fantastic<00:00:56.760> no<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
really bond to it fantastic no so I just

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
really bond to it fantastic no so I just
spray<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.859> sounds<00:00:59.129> too<00:00:59.280> easy<00:00:59.309> well

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
spray that on it sounds too easy well

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.180 
spray that on it sounds too easy well
you<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.750> prep<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> glass<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
you got to prep the glass just like you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
you got to prep the glass just like you
would<00:01:02.309> prep<00:01:02.550> paint<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.149> prep<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
would prep paint you want to prep it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
would prep paint you want to prep it
before<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> coating<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.350> because

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
before you put the coating on because

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
before you put the coating on because
that<00:01:05.220> coating<00:01:05.700> needs<00:01:05.850> an<00:01:06.000> absolutely

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that coating needs an absolutely

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.399 
that coating needs an absolutely
surgical<00:01:07.409> clean<00:01:08.010> surface<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.030> bond<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
surgical clean surface to bond to now to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
surgical clean surface to bond to now to
do<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.740> we're<00:01:11.100> gonna<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.310> apart<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
do that we're gonna use apart from the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.190 
do that we're gonna use apart from the
Detailers<00:01:12.510> line<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.900> our

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
Detailers line this is our

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.130 
Detailers line this is our
high-performance<00:01:14.159> glass<00:01:14.610> cleaner<00:01:15.090> okay<00:01:15.600> okay

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
high-performance glass cleaner okay okay

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
high-performance glass cleaner okay okay
now<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.500> apply<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.310> hand<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> lot

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
now you can apply this by hand and a lot

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
now you can apply this by hand and a lot
of<00:01:18.630> times<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.080> were<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.439> by<00:01:19.530> hand<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
of times if I were to do it by hand I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.080 
of times if I were to do it by hand I
would<00:01:19.950> use<00:01:20.070> something<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> microfiber

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
would use something like a microfiber

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
would use something like a microfiber
applicator<00:01:21.479> pad<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.650> gives<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
applicator pad that gives you a little

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
applicator pad that gives you a little
bit<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> scrubbing<00:01:23.549> power<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> said<00:01:25.080> I'm

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bit of scrubbing power but I said I'm

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.330 
bit of scrubbing power but I said I'm
gonna<00:01:25.290> show<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.619> how<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.130> by<00:01:26.220> machine

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
gonna show you how to do it by machine
