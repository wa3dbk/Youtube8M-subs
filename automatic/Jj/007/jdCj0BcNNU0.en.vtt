this<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> brief<00:00:03.570> introduction<00:00:04.380> into

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
this is a brief introduction into

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.579 
this is a brief introduction into
developing<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.299> apps<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:06.960> tablets<00:00:07.410> on

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
developing and apps for tablets on

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.660 
developing and apps for tablets on
Android<00:00:09.440> right<00:00:10.440> now<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.860> am<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.610> to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
Android right now I am just going to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.620 
Android right now I am just going to
show<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:13.370> little<00:00:14.370> tutorial<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.150> why<00:00:15.420> it's

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
show you a little tutorial and why it's

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.450 
show you a little tutorial and why it's
a<00:00:15.719> little<00:00:15.929> different<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.500> developing<00:00:17.190> an<00:00:17.310> app

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
a little different for developing an app

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.790 
a little different for developing an app
for<00:00:17.760> tablet<00:00:18.359> versus<00:00:18.779> developing<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
for tablet versus developing up for a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
for tablet versus developing up for a
phone<00:00:20.100> right<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> same<00:00:21.960> app

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
phone right now this is the same app

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.660 
phone right now this is the same app
running<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.769> both<00:00:23.070> devices<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.519> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
running on both devices but here this is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.210 
running on both devices but here this is
a<00:00:26.810> device<00:00:27.810> running<00:00:28.109> Ice<00:00:28.320> Cream<00:00:28.590> Sandwich<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
a device running Ice Cream Sandwich and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.720 
a device running Ice Cream Sandwich and
this<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> device<00:00:30.330> running<00:00:30.900> honeycomb<00:00:31.730> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this one is a device running honeycomb I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
this one is a device running honeycomb I
picked<00:00:33.690> honeycomb<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:34.710> only

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
picked honeycomb because that's only

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.250 
picked honeycomb because that's only
available<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.820> tablets<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
available on tablets so it's kind of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.729 
available on tablets so it's kind of
obvious<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.719> like<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:39.960> only<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.559> layout

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
obvious I like there's only one layout

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.650 
obvious I like there's only one layout
for<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.829> real<00:00:44.190> estate

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
for this you have a lot more real estate

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.250 
for this you have a lot more real estate
available<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> tablet<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:48.020> doing<00:00:49.020> things

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
available on a tablet so doing things

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.680 
available on a tablet so doing things
like<00:00:49.410> putting<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.829> listview<00:00:50.610> over<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
like putting a listview over here and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.229 
like putting a listview over here and
then<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.350> web<00:00:52.559> view<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.760> activated

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then a web view which is an activated

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.459 
then a web view which is an activated
because<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.570> haven't<00:00:54.719> clicked<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.199> anything

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
because I haven't clicked on anything

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.459 
because I haven't clicked on anything
over<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.480> allows<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> utilize<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.199> lot

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
over here allows you to utilize a lot

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.729 
over here allows you to utilize a lot
more<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> real<00:00:59.160> estate<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> screen<00:01:00.739> on

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
more of the real estate of the screen on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.799 
more of the real estate of the screen on
previous<00:01:02.340> versions<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> Android<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.600> was

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
previous versions of Android this was

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780 
previous versions of Android this was
impossible<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.189> only<00:01:05.220> run<00:01:05.549> one

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
impossible because you can only run one

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.929 
impossible because you can only run one
activity<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.979> currently<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.549> now

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
activity at a time it currently is now

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
activity at a time it currently is now
possible<00:01:09.380> with<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:12.200> compatibility<00:01:13.200> pack<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
possible with a compatibility pack that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.120 
possible with a compatibility pack that
google<00:01:15.060> has<00:01:15.210> released<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.979> actually

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
google has released so you can actually

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.230 
google has released so you can actually
do<00:01:17.700> items<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.729> older<00:01:20.729> versions<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
do items like this in older versions of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
do items like this in older versions of
android<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.930> those<00:01:22.439> first<00:01:22.710> introduced<00:01:23.250> on

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
android but those first introduced on

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.260 
android but those first introduced on
honeycomb<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:26.040> reason<00:01:26.369> why<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.090> done

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
honeycomb the reason why it can be done

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.690 
honeycomb the reason why it can be done
before<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.920> can't<00:01:29.220> run<00:01:29.490> two

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
before is because you can't run two

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
before is because you can't run two
activities<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.540> once<00:01:30.750> there's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> list<00:01:31.710> view

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
activities at once there's a list view

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.359 
activities at once there's a list view
which<00:01:32.280> runs<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.700> list<00:01:32.909> activity<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
which runs a list activity and this is a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
which runs a list activity and this is a
web<00:01:35.729> view<00:01:35.939> which<00:01:36.180> runs<00:01:36.450> its<00:01:36.659> own<00:01:36.810> activity<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
web view which runs its own activity the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.249 
web view which runs its own activity the
way<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> works<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.180> honeycomb<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.930> newer

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
way that it works on honeycomb a newer

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.249 
way that it works on honeycomb a newer
is<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> compatibility<00:01:42.960> pack

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is and not with the compatibility pack

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.649 
is and not with the compatibility pack
is<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.220> split<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> activities<00:01:45.329> into

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is you split up the activities into

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170 
is you split up the activities into
fragments<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.649> now<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> list<00:01:47.579> fragment

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
fragments so now this is a list fragment

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
fragments so now this is a list fragment
and<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> web<00:01:49.049> view<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.649> its<00:01:49.860> own

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and this is a web view which is its own

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
and this is a web view which is its own
fragment<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.450> running<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.079> giant

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
fragment and it's running in a giant

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.899 
fragment and it's running in a giant
activity<00:01:53.280> which<00:01:53.490> allows<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.470> do<00:01:55.470> both<00:01:55.909> now

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
activity which allows you to do both now

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.580 
activity which allows you to do both now
on<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.500> phone<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.960> away<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.380> not

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
on a phone you can get away with not

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
on a phone you can get away with not
having<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.240> ice<00:02:03.479> cream

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
having to do this but an ice cream

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
having to do this but an ice cream
sandwich<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.229> handles<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> fragments<00:02:05.219> anyway

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
sandwich or handles the fragments anyway

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.420 
sandwich or handles the fragments anyway
play<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.179> same<00:02:06.359> way<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:10.009> like<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.250> were<00:02:11.310> to

play the same way so like if you were to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.309 
play the same way so like if you were to

viewer on here if I click on that same
item<00:02:17.280> which<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.599> clicked<00:02:19.049> on<00:02:19.230> zovirax

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
item which on here I clicked on zovirax

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.460 
item which on here I clicked on zovirax
so<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.310> sick<00:02:20.519> live<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:21.260> I'm<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so it's a sick live here I'm going to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.280 
so it's a sick live here I'm going to
pull<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:23.879> my<00:02:24.060> own<00:02:24.299> web<00:02:25.049> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
pull up this and I see my own web you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.190 
pull up this and I see my own web you
see<00:02:26.160> now<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:26.910> lot<00:02:27.150> nicer<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
see now this is a lot nicer on the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.430 
see now this is a lot nicer on the
tablet<00:02:28.680> which<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.840> theoretically<00:02:30.840> could<00:02:31.110> on

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
tablet which I theoretically could on

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.740 
tablet which I theoretically could on
the<00:02:31.769> phone<00:02:32.040> make<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.760> zoomed<00:02:33.000> out<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.239> lot<00:02:33.540> more

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the phone make it zoomed out a lot more

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.900 
the phone make it zoomed out a lot more
but<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> lot<00:02:34.769> easier<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.190> view<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.670> on

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
but it's a lot easier to view this on

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.059 
but it's a lot easier to view this on
the<00:02:36.030> tablet<00:02:36.540> without<00:02:36.690> having<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> zoom<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.709> or

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
the tablet without having to zoom out or

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
the tablet without having to zoom out or
anything<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.390> pretty<00:02:39.660> much<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
anything like that it's pretty much in a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.670 
anything like that it's pretty much in a
very<00:02:40.470> nice<00:02:41.120> format<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.959> i<00:02:42.989> actually<00:02:43.349> really

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
very nice format that i actually really

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.270 
very nice format that i actually really
like<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.610> for<00:02:45.480> me<00:02:45.629> this<00:02:45.930> app<00:02:46.170> was<00:02:46.379> when<00:02:47.250> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
like so for me this app was when I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
like so for me this app was when I
developed<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.970> over<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> year<00:02:48.810> ago<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:49.230> perfect

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
developed it over a year ago was perfect

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.660 
developed it over a year ago was perfect
to<00:02:49.829> do<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:51.049> in<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.230> tablet<00:02:53.930> for<00:02:55.459> tablet<00:02:56.459> rather

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
to do on in a tablet for tablet rather

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.190 
to do on in a tablet for tablet rather
than<00:02:56.879> doing<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.239> full<00:02:57.450> phone<00:02:57.629> even<00:02:58.049> though<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
than doing a full phone even though it

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.880 
than doing a full phone even though it
still<00:02:58.620> works<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.250> phone<00:03:00.530> before<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
still works on the phone before you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.589 
still works on the phone before you
didn't<00:03:02.190> need<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.700> wanted<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.000> make<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> list

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
didn't need if you wanted to make a list

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.530 
didn't need if you wanted to make a list
view<00:03:03.750> right<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.560> launched<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.069> new

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
view right here that launched a new

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.210 
view right here that launched a new
activity<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:07.079> wasn't<00:03:07.379> an<00:03:07.470> issue<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.069> could

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
activity that wasn't an issue you could

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.879 
activity that wasn't an issue you could
always<00:03:08.400> do<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.359> far<00:03:09.690> back<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:09.900> Android

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
always do that as far back as Android

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.650 
always do that as far back as Android
goes<00:03:11.130> but<00:03:12.889> with<00:03:13.889> this<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.519> can<00:03:14.730> utilize<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.389> lot

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
goes but with this you can utilize a lot

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.629 
goes but with this you can utilize a lot
more<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.139> real<00:03:16.349> estate<00:03:16.500> develop<00:03:17.250> one<00:03:17.459> app

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
more of the real estate develop one app

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.970 
more of the real estate develop one app
and<00:03:17.940> now<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.180> compatible<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.980> multiple

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and now it's compatible on multiple

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.940 
and now it's compatible on multiple
devices<00:03:20.480> which<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.660> very<00:03:21.870> nice<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.530> this<00:03:22.919> is

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
devices which is very nice so this is

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.430 
devices which is very nice so this is
the<00:03:23.099> exact<00:03:23.489> same<00:03:23.700> map<00:03:23.910> I've<00:03:24.150> done<00:03:24.389> nothing<00:03:24.569> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the exact same map I've done nothing to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.589 
the exact same map I've done nothing to
the<00:03:26.209> actual<00:03:27.209> program<00:03:28.049> or<00:03:28.349> application<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:30.000> run

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
the actual program or application to run

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.780 
the actual program or application to run
differently<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.919> really<00:03:32.190> want<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.549> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
differently and if I really want this to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.509 
differently and if I really want this to
run<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> phone<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:34.560> really<00:03:34.919> just<00:03:35.220> put

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
run like a phone I can really just put

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.930 
run like a phone I can really just put
this<00:03:35.669> in<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.299> portrait<00:03:37.049> mode<00:03:37.609> on<00:03:38.609> an<00:03:38.790> emulator

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
this in a portrait mode on an emulator

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.690 
this in a portrait mode on an emulator
you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.049> go<00:03:40.410> into<00:03:40.560> portrait<00:03:41.040> mode<00:03:41.190> by<00:03:41.430> hitting

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
you can go into portrait mode by hitting

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.580 
you can go into portrait mode by hitting
ctrl<00:03:42.150> f11<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:45.630> pulls<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.109> exact

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
ctrl f11 and that pulls up the exact

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.770 
ctrl f11 and that pulls up the exact
same<00:03:47.209> look<00:03:48.209> as<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.169> if<00:03:49.889> i<00:03:49.980> wanted<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.340> i

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
same look as this so if i wanted to i

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.420 
same look as this so if i wanted to i
can<00:03:51.780> just<00:03:51.930> click<00:03:52.139> this<00:03:52.349> and<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:53.040> launches<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
can just click this and it launches a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.220 
can just click this and it launches a
new<00:03:54.019> fragment<00:03:55.970> now<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.630> way<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.959> runs

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
new fragment now the way this runs

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.830 
new fragment now the way this runs
differently<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.669> you<00:04:00.180> do<00:04:00.329> need<00:04:00.510> another

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
differently is that you do need another

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.599 
differently is that you do need another
activity<00:04:01.349> in<00:04:01.620> order<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.190> things<00:04:02.459> in

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
activity in order to do things in

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.970 
activity in order to do things in
portrait<00:04:03.000> mode<00:04:03.079> because<00:04:04.079> you're<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.799> need

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
portrait mode because you're you need

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.589 
portrait mode because you're you need
something<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.430> handle<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.180> transition

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
something to handle the transition

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.890 
something to handle the transition
between<00:04:07.079> launching<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.650> new<00:04:07.799> activity<00:04:08.370> so

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
between launching the new activity so

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.220 
between launching the new activity so
you<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:11.000> second<00:04:12.000> activity<00:04:12.299> when<00:04:13.049> you

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
you do have a second activity when you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.759 
you do have a second activity when you
do<00:04:13.440> when<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.160> take<00:04:14.340> an<00:04:14.459> account

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
do when you take an account

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.750 
do when you take an account
handling<00:04:16.769> things<00:04:16.980> in<00:04:17.190> portrait<00:04:17.640> and

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
handling things in portrait and

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.000 
handling things in portrait and
landscape<00:04:17.970> mode<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:19.230> that<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.799> something

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
landscape mode so that is something

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.470 
landscape mode so that is something
you're<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> have<00:04:20.610> to<00:04:20.820> take<00:04:21.000> an<00:04:21.150> account

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
you're going to have to take an account

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.660 
you're going to have to take an account
when<00:04:21.660> you're<00:04:21.810> developing<00:04:22.170> an<00:04:22.950> app<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:23.610> a

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
when you're developing an app for a

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.990 
when you're developing an app for a
tablet<00:04:24.440> even<00:04:25.440> though<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.070> develop

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
tablet even though you can develop

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.210 
tablet even though you can develop
everything<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:28.140> landscape<00:04:28.500> mode<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:28.830> keep

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
everything in a landscape mode and keep

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.130 
everything in a landscape mode and keep
it<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.490> way<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.760> keep<00:04:29.880> one<00:04:30.120> activity<00:04:30.450> you

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
it that way and keep one activity you

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.100 
it that way and keep one activity you
can<00:04:31.230> also<00:04:32.240> make<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.420> compatible<00:04:33.720> with

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
can also make it compatible with

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260 
can also make it compatible with
multiple<00:04:34.530> multiple<00:04:34.980> devices<00:04:35.490> by<00:04:35.820> adding<00:04:36.180> a

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
multiple multiple devices by adding a

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.910 
multiple multiple devices by adding a
second<00:04:36.630> activity<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.170> handle<00:04:37.560> this

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
second activity to handle this

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.710 
second activity to handle this
transition<00:04:38.370> into<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.850> separate<00:04:40.940> viewer<00:04:41.940> now

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
transition into a separate viewer now

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.230 
transition into a separate viewer now
the<00:04:43.320> way<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.500> these<00:04:44.130> works<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.760> just<00:04:45.090> an

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
the way that these works it's just an

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.630 
the way that these works it's just an
intent<00:04:46.100> intense<00:04:47.100> allow<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.820> launch

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
intent intense allow you to launch

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.400 
intent intense allow you to launch
different<00:04:50.640> things<00:04:50.700> like<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.450> put<00:04:52.260> this

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
different things like you can put this

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.380 
different things like you can put this
in<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.740> text<00:04:53.130> view<00:04:53.310> if<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.670> wanted<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.180> which<00:04:54.360> is

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
in a text view if you wanted to which is

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.420 
in a text view if you wanted to which is
actually<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.900> most<00:04:54.930> basic<00:04:55.620> example<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.280> you

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
actually the most basic example that you

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.600 
actually the most basic example that you
see<00:04:56.670> for<00:04:57.230> handling<00:04:58.230> fragments<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.160> see<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
see for handling fragments is you see a

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.750 
see for handling fragments is you see a
list<00:05:00.540> on<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.840> left<00:05:01.170> and<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.620> text<00:05:02.340> view<00:05:02.490> on<00:05:02.670> the

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
list on the left and a text view on the

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.840 
list on the left and a text view on the
right<00:05:02.970> I<00:05:03.350> decided<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.530> show<00:05:04.710> my<00:05:05.550> own

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
right I decided to show my own

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.910 
right I decided to show my own
application<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.810> i<00:05:06.840> developed<00:05:07.080> which<00:05:07.620> i

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
application that i developed which i

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.140 
application that i developed which i
haven't<00:05:08.670> published<00:05:09.210> on<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.540> line<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:10.500> um

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
this is a my my app that i keep pretty

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.390 
this is a my my app that i keep pretty
much<00:05:15.510> for<00:05:15.780> myself<00:05:16.170> because<00:05:16.530> I'm<00:05:16.770> probably<00:05:17.220> the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
much for myself because I'm probably the

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.800 
much for myself because I'm probably the
only<00:05:17.490> person<00:05:17.670> in<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> world<00:05:18.210> who<00:05:18.450> would<00:05:18.570> use

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
only person in the world who would use

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.740 
only person in the world who would use
it<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:22.770> go<00:05:22.919> back<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.640> get<00:05:24.300> back<00:05:24.570> to

your own little list view in webview now
i'll<00:05:27.660> go<00:05:27.870> into<00:05:28.130> future<00:05:29.130> videos<00:05:29.490> on<00:05:29.730> how<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.000> set

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
i'll go into future videos on how to set

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.240 
i'll go into future videos on how to set
this<00:05:30.510> up<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.560> just<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:33.860> info<00:05:34.860> like<00:05:35.220> a
