where<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.530> was<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.480> then<00:00:12.480> when<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> found<00:00:12.929> it

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
where it was at and then when I found it

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.849 
where it was at and then when I found it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.920 
and the hidden star as I have just found
out<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.550> also<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.129> all

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.319
