00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.850
 lilly mmm 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.840
 let's see the pivotal positions now 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.449
 of the instrument 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.620
 that is the basic ones to keep 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.789
 always 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.310
 the thumb 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.550
 under the knuckle finger this case in metal missing plastic saxophones 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.250
 but here we are in this way 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.920
 trying not to go too far 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.670
 tumi maintain 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.990
 a position 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.410
 quite 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.080
 content then 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 long to stay more or less the tip of the finger below 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.840
 you don't have to go out much of a tunnel 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 from the finger rest 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.160
 the other thumb but we will place on the other plastic rest that is 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.880
 next to the spokesman 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.360
 in this way 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.870
 before showing you the fingering on the instrument the important thing to know 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.870
 and as a tool it exceeds the notes as you call it tampons so not 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.810
 We can 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.270
 unless there are particular positions 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.409
 but that we are not interested in now 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.230
 we can't open 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.780
 a half note when below are already closed 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.220
 it's a fundamental concept soon 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.620
 let's take the C major scale as a reference for reviewing the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 painting 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.240
 let's start from the door 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.570
 third finger 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.680
 the remaining thumb etro 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 we count 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.270
 2 3 the 4 the fourth place eldo probably you 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.159
 instead of mother of pearl here too 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 why a drop 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 this a saxophone rather lactate then 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000
 has mother of pearl 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.650
 staff yes 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.140
 facimm we make this exchange 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.440
 colin says ok it let me see it by removing the fingers 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
 it happens this way 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.920
 go down 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.339
 plate 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.339
 we go down on the other hand 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.339
 and we will have 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.619
 the mi 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.619
 on the second one 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.109
 here we come back to recapitulate 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 Yup 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.749
 sol 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.749
 then we go down on the other hand if we have 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.099
 an important thing to always keep your fingers 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 tight-fitting keys never do this thing here 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.119
 donated makes no sense 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.629
 you lose speed you make noise always attacked 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.319
 and then another important thing to keep them always on the mother of pearl we try not to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.749
 go appurtenances to go forward 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.749
 let's try to keep them 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.749
 back possible ie on mother-of-pearl 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.749
 that even the softer the closure 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.469
 let's start now with the first sound 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:26.569
 let's position ourselves south we count care 2 sections 4 we are on the dock 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:31.949
 the thumb behind and under the mouthpiece and place the mouthpiece in this 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.339
 way 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.189
 once we are this evening to you 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.279
 let's be more relaxed, let's try to have one 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.679
 position 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.589
 on the horizon that look 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589
 let's avoid diaphragm pushing the first sound 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.479
 let's keep it sound 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.699
 stationary 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.479
 without undulations 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.409
 dyed born
