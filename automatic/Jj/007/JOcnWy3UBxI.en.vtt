number one and by kid number seven it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
number one and by kid number seven it
comes<00:00:44.370> back<00:00:44.550> empty<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.269> they<00:00:45.420> didn't<00:00:45.659> really

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
comes back empty so they didn't really

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
comes back empty so they didn't really
have<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.109> place<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> table<00:00:46.949> so<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
have to place it on the table so it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.410 
have to place it on the table so it
didn't<00:00:48.269> need<00:00:48.359> to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.510> particularly<00:00:48.929> why<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
didn't need to be particularly why and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
didn't need to be particularly why and
the<00:00:51.420> table<00:00:51.809> became<00:00:52.230> finished<00:00:52.739> simply<00:00:53.429> by

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the table became finished simply by

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.630 
the table became finished simply by
virtue<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.269> whatever<00:00:54.719> gets<00:00:54.929> spilled<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
virtue of whatever gets spilled on and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.219 
virtue of whatever gets spilled on and
that<00:00:56.640> kept<00:00:56.909> it<00:00:57.030> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.269> moist<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:58.050> may

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
that kept it kind of moist and they may

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.660 
that kept it kind of moist and they may
have<00:00:58.350> broke<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.739> pink<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.339> now<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
have broke some pink that in a now and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
have broke some pink that in a now and
then<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.089> keep<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> oiled<00:01:00.569> in<00:01:00.809> something

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
then just to keep it oiled in something

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.490 
then just to keep it oiled in something
but<00:01:01.679> very<00:01:02.219> simple<00:01:02.519> humble<00:01:02.940> beginnings<00:01:03.539> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
but very simple humble beginnings but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
but very simple humble beginnings but
now<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.339> farm<00:01:05.610> table<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.030> far<00:01:06.240> more

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
now the farm table is far more

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.289 
now the farm table is far more
sophisticated<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:07.590> longevity<00:01:08.299> design

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
sophisticated with longevity design

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
sophisticated with longevity design
right<00:01:09.690> into<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.470> floating<00:01:10.740> breadboard

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
right into it the floating breadboard

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 
right into it the floating breadboard
the<00:01:11.760> way<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> table<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> attached<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the way the table is attached to the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
the way the table is attached to the
base<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.770> wait<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> top

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
base so wait to is a lot on the top

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
base so wait to is a lot on the top
float<00:01:15.420> freely<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.410> mortise<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> tenon<00:01:17.130> on

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
float freely the mortise and tenon on

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.860 
float freely the mortise and tenon on
the<00:01:17.340> legs<00:01:17.550> these<00:01:17.970> particular<00:01:18.330> legs<00:01:18.690> are

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
the legs these particular legs are

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.900 
the legs these particular legs are
allowed<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> come<00:01:19.680> off<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.190> lag

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
allowed to come off we have to lag

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.180 
allowed to come off we have to lag
screws<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.780> fix<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.410> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> base<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
screws that fix them to the base and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.720 
screws that fix them to the base and
makes<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.300> easy<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> maneuver<00:01:25.140> around

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
makes it easy to kind of maneuver around

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.700 
makes it easy to kind of maneuver around
so<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:27.480> finishing<00:01:27.840> techniques<00:01:28.230> are<00:01:28.440> far

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so the finishing techniques are far

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
so the finishing techniques are far
different<00:01:28.740> than<00:01:29.250> way<00:01:29.790> back<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.210> old<00:01:30.420> where<00:01:30.690> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
different than way back of old where it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
different than way back of old where it
was<00:01:30.870> just<00:01:31.050> allowed<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.440> age<00:01:31.620> naturally<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
was just allowed to age naturally and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
was just allowed to age naturally and
whatever<00:01:32.550> gets<00:01:32.730> still<00:01:32.940> done<00:01:33.120> it<00:01:33.240> did<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.990> has

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
whatever gets still done it did this has

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170 
whatever gets still done it did this has
a<00:01:34.440> nice<00:01:34.830> finish<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.490> top<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.030> make

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
a nice finish on the top that will make

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.260 
a nice finish on the top that will make
it<00:01:36.300> on<00:01:36.480> a<00:01:36.510> roll<00:01:36.980> and<00:01:37.980> nothing<00:01:38.430> glows<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.970> an

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it on a roll and nothing glows like an

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.810 
it on a roll and nothing glows like an
old<00:01:39.450> wood<00:01:39.720> farm<00:01:39.930> table<00:01:40.200> especially<00:01:40.980> when<00:01:41.700> it
