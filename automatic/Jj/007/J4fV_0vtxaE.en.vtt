out of home so I will always have this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
out of home so I will always have this
guide<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.570> my<00:03:12.660> bag<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.380> if<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> guys<00:03:13.739> actually

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
guide in my bag so if you guys actually

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.280 
guide in my bag so if you guys actually
asked<00:03:14.640> me<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.030> little<00:03:15.329> while<00:03:15.480> ago<00:03:15.600> if<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.110> found

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
asked me a little while ago if I found

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.009 
asked me a little while ago if I found
it<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.650> bit<00:03:16.680> heavy<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.610> lag<00:03:17.850> around<00:03:18.269> I'm<00:03:18.510> not

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
it a bit heavy to lag around I'm not

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.380 
it a bit heavy to lag around I'm not
really<00:03:19.380> because<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.130> not<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.670> big<00:03:21.030> and

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
really because it's not that big and

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.980 
really because it's not that big and
it's

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
it's

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.410 
it's
lightweight<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.010> definitely<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:24.090> that

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
lightweight but I definitely think that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.480 
lightweight but I definitely think that
if<00:03:24.900> you've<00:03:25.200> got<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> lot<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.920> carry<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.220> your<00:03:26.250> bag

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
if you've got a lot to carry in your bag

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.700 
if you've got a lot to carry in your bag
already<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:27.300> maybe<00:03:27.600> going<00:03:27.870> for<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.200> slightly

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
already then maybe going for a slightly

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.130 
already then maybe going for a slightly
smaller<00:03:29.160> planner<00:03:29.610> maybe<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.150> from<00:03:30.510> Kiki<00:03:30.720> okay

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
smaller planner maybe one from Kiki okay

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.840 
smaller planner maybe one from Kiki okay
that's<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> little<00:03:31.710> bit<00:03:31.800> lighter<00:03:32.070> as<00:03:32.310> well<00:03:32.340> and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
that's a little bit lighter as well and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.570 
that's a little bit lighter as well and
that's<00:03:32.910> food<00:03:33.150> production<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.020> then<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.340> write

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
that's food production and then to write

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.400 
that's food production and then to write

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
water I really like the bus water

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.560 
water I really like the bus water
bottles<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:11.580> they're<00:04:11.880> made<00:04:12.060> from<00:04:12.330> glass

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
bottles because they're made from glass

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.510 
bottles because they're made from glass
so<00:04:12.930> I'm<00:04:13.020> not<00:04:13.290> actually<00:04:13.530> contributing<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.340> the

I<00:04:34.130> kind<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.250> think<00:04:35.400> it's<00:04:35.580> healthy<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.030> don't

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
I kind of think it's healthy I don't

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.730 
I kind of think it's healthy I don't
know<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.450> depends<00:04:36.720> which<00:04:36.930> music<00:04:37.320> visor<00:04:37.500> buy

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
know it depends which music visor buy

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.810 
know it depends which music visor buy
because<00:04:37.950> some<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.220> them<00:04:38.370> are<00:04:38.430> loaded<00:04:38.730> with

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
because some of them are loaded with

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.490 
because some of them are loaded with
sugar<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.570> think<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.050> one's<00:04:40.290> pretty

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
sugar so I think this one's pretty

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.050
