with<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.730> chemical<00:02:24.270> peel<00:02:24.450> which<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.080> believe<00:02:25.350> was

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
with a chemical peel which I believe was

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.670 
with a chemical peel which I believe was
the<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> TCA<00:02:27.240> peel<00:02:27.360> does<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> 15<00:02:28.230> percent

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the like a TCA peel does a 15 percent

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
the like a TCA peel does a 15 percent
peel<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:30.000> should<00:02:30.239> talk<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:30.569> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
peel and I should talk about that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.720 
peel and I should talk about that
sometime<00:02:31.230> soon<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.770> really<00:02:32.340> really

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
sometime soon because I really really

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
sometime soon because I really really
liked<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.870> went<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> different

not that I've had all this facial
plastic<00:02:38.640> surgery<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:39.930> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.170> who<00:02:40.290> I

asked her what she thought about those

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.199 
asked her what she thought about those
lines<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.780> she<00:03:07.140> said<00:03:07.470> well<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.730> try<00:03:08.970> just

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
lines and she said well we can try just

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.660 
lines and she said well we can try just
a<00:03:09.360> little<00:03:09.390> bit<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.810> Botox<00:03:09.959> there<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.830> see<00:03:11.519> how

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
a little bit of Botox there and see how

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.259 
a little bit of Botox there and see how
it<00:03:11.819> works

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
it works

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.270 
it works
so<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> did<00:03:13.110> let<00:03:13.260> her<00:03:13.380> go<00:03:13.530> ahead<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
so I did let her go ahead and do that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.569 
so I did let her go ahead and do that
for<00:03:14.790> me<00:03:14.940> she<00:03:15.690> basically<00:03:16.080> did<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.769> two<00:03:17.160> units

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
for me she basically did just two units

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.330 
for me she basically did just two units
here<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.150> two<00:03:18.720> units<00:03:18.900> here<00:03:19.320> which<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.070> almost

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
here and two units here which is almost

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.520 
here and two units here which is almost
like<00:03:20.549> not<00:03:20.880> even<00:03:21.120> having<00:03:21.299> Botox<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.079> it

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
like not even having Botox and it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.830 
like not even having Botox and it
basically<00:03:22.650> did<00:03:23.130> nothing<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.180> what<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.420> did<00:03:24.630> was

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
basically did nothing so what I did was

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.020 
basically did nothing so what I did was
I<00:03:24.959> went<00:03:25.140> back<00:03:25.380> about<00:03:25.620> ten<00:03:25.890> days<00:03:26.070> later<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.880> we

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
I went back about ten days later and we

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.640 
I went back about ten days later and we
saw<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.420> yeah<00:03:27.600> basically<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.260> didn't<00:03:28.500> do

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
saw that yeah basically it didn't do

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.979 
saw that yeah basically it didn't do
anything<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.730> she<00:03:29.760> went<00:03:30.060> ahead<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.540> added

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
anything so she went ahead and added

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.870 
anything so she went ahead and added
some<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.890> she<00:03:31.950> added<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.400> little<00:03:32.549> bit<00:03:32.730> right

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
some so she added a little bit right

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.360 
some so she added a little bit right
here<00:03:33.090> she<00:03:33.299> did<00:03:33.420> one<00:03:33.690> here<00:03:34.079> one<00:03:34.410> unit<00:03:34.920> here<00:03:35.250> and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
here she did one here one unit here and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.330 
here she did one here one unit here and
one<00:03:35.790> unit<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.500> was<00:03:37.620> two<00:03:37.860> more<00:03:38.100> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
one unit here so that was two more and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.640 
one unit here so that was two more and
then<00:03:38.790> she<00:03:39.000> did<00:03:39.180> two<00:03:39.390> more<00:03:39.570> units<00:03:39.780> here<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.380> two

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
then she did two more units here and two

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.710 
then she did two more units here and two
more<00:03:40.860> units<00:03:41.070> here<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.209> had<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> total

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
more units here so I think I had a total

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.660 
more units here so I think I had a total
of<00:03:43.310> two<00:03:44.310> four<00:03:44.910> six<00:03:45.359> eight<00:03:45.660> nine<00:03:46.590> ten<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.190> think<00:03:47.400> I

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
of two four six eight nine ten I think I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.310 
of two four six eight nine ten I think I
had<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.090> don't<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.630> thought<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.870> was<00:03:48.959> maybe<00:03:49.109> more

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
had I don't I thought it was maybe more

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.229 
had I don't I thought it was maybe more
like<00:03:49.440> 14<00:03:49.859> units<00:03:50.220> altogether<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.910> might<00:03:51.120> have

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
like 14 units altogether it might have

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.360 
like 14 units altogether it might have
just<00:03:51.269> been<00:03:51.570> ten<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.829> look<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.070> up<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.250> I

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
just been ten but I can look it up and I

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.910 
just been ten but I can look it up and I
will<00:03:53.519> put<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.790> down<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.079> you<00:03:55.470> guys<00:03:55.680> will

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
will put it down here so you guys will

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.120 
will put it down here so you guys will
know<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.609> had<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.180> done<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.739> really

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
know so I had that done and it's really

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.729 
know so I had that done and it's really
an<00:03:59.340> interesting<00:03:59.609> thing<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.989> did<00:04:01.109> see<00:04:01.709> a

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
an interesting thing but I did see a

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.640 
an interesting thing but I did see a
very<00:04:02.130> slight<00:04:02.609> difference<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.140> some<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
very slight difference and some of the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.160 
very slight difference and some of the
funny<00:04:04.829> things<00:04:04.920> are<00:04:05.370> or<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.209> can't<00:04:06.540> do<00:04:06.870> as

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
funny things are or that you can't do as

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.920 
funny things are or that you can't do as
much<00:04:08.070> movement<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.820> your<00:04:09.030> upper<00:04:09.480> lip<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
much movement in your upper lip and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.970 
much movement in your upper lip and
that's<00:04:10.170> another<00:04:10.440> reason<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.890> don't

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
that's another reason that you don't

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.620 
that's another reason that you don't
want<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.220> get<00:04:11.310> too<00:04:11.519> much<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.940> especially<00:04:12.030> too

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
want to get too much and especially too

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.849 
want to get too much and especially too
fast<00:04:12.930> because<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.350> don't<00:04:13.500> want<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.799> have

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
fast because you don't want to just have

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.069 
fast because you don't want to just have
you<00:04:14.760> know<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.120> top<00:04:15.390> lip<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.840> just

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
you know just a top lip that just

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.949 
you know just a top lip that just
doesn't<00:04:16.350> do<00:04:16.650> anything<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.600> just<00:04:18.780> got<00:04:18.930> a

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
doesn't do anything so it's just got a

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.479 
doesn't do anything so it's just got a
little<00:04:19.260> bit<00:04:19.350> awkward<00:04:19.709> feeling<00:04:20.070> when<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> eat

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
little bit awkward feeling when I eat

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.790 
little bit awkward feeling when I eat
sometimes<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.169> just<00:04:22.409> kind<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.590> getting

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
sometimes you know just kind of getting

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.350 
sometimes you know just kind of getting
food<00:04:22.979> off<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.370> fork<00:04:23.669> or<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.909> spoon<00:04:23.970> or

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
food off of a fork or a spoon or

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.230 
food off of a fork or a spoon or
something<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:25.650> when<00:04:25.979> I'm<00:04:26.099> aware<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.789> it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
something is when I'm aware of it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.420 
something is when I'm aware of it
as<00:04:27.300> well<00:04:27.840> as<00:04:28.050> when<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.259> try<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.530> whistle<00:04:28.800> which

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
as well as when I try to whistle which

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.999 
as well as when I try to whistle which
makes<00:04:29.789> me<00:04:29.970> realize<00:04:30.389> how<00:04:30.750> much<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:31.410> do<00:04:31.590> whistle

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
makes me realize how much you do whistle

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.610 
makes me realize how much you do whistle
or<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.460> whistle<00:04:32.910> because<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.180> have<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.330> dog<00:04:33.620> and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
or I whistle because I have a dog and

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.439 
or I whistle because I have a dog and
that<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.310> shouldn't<00:04:35.580> be<00:04:35.729> doing<00:04:35.759> that<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.150> need<00:04:36.240> to

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
that I shouldn't be doing that I need to

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.689 
that I shouldn't be doing that I need to
try<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.690> not<00:04:36.960> do<00:04:37.259> that<00:04:37.470> because<00:04:37.919> that's<00:04:38.550> a

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
try to not do that because that's a

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.400 
try to not do that because that's a
movement<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.120> obviously<00:04:39.630> causes<00:04:40.199> those

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
movement that obviously causes those

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.320 
movement that obviously causes those
lines<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:41.250> come<00:04:41.430> even<00:04:41.729> more<00:04:41.880> because<00:04:42.060> that's

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
lines to come even more because that's

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.270 
lines to come even more because that's
considered<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:43.139> facial<00:04:43.470> expression<00:04:44.069> that

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
considered a facial expression that

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.969 
considered a facial expression that
you're<00:04:44.910> doing<00:04:45.090> over<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.569> over<00:04:45.720> again<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.410> like

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
you're doing over and over again so like

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.529 
you're doing over and over again so like
I<00:04:47.130> said<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.490> mean<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.669> do<00:04:47.819> see<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.180> slight

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
I said I mean I do see a slight

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.260 
I said I mean I do see a slight
softening<00:04:49.319> in<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> lines<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:50.789> wouldn't

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
softening in the lines but I wouldn't

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.990 
softening in the lines but I wouldn't
say<00:04:51.539> it's<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.840> hundred<00:04:52.080> percent<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:53.000> guarantee

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
say it's a hundred percent a guarantee

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.890 
say it's a hundred percent a guarantee
then<00:04:54.330> I'm<00:04:54.389> going<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.539> show<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.660> another

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
Botox done so I kind of feel like I

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.730 
Botox done so I kind of feel like I
can't<00:05:08.130> say<00:05:08.400> whether<00:05:08.639> or<00:05:08.759> not<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.150> works<00:05:09.740> if

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740
