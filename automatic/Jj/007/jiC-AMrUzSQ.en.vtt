shelf but I can imagine most people are
probably<00:04:25.680> gonna<00:04:25.949> throw<00:04:26.160> this<00:04:26.340> away<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.699> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
probably gonna throw this away in the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.670 
probably gonna throw this away in the
trash<00:04:27.060> along<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.289> rest<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.590> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
packaging so there we go guys there is a

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.010 
packaging so there we go guys there is a
look<00:04:34.740> at<00:04:34.949> beta<00:04:35.430> ray<00:04:35.729> bill<00:04:35.759> he's<00:04:36.570> certainly<00:04:36.930> the
