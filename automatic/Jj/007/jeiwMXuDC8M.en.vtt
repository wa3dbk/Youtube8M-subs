00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.859
Hi everyone! In this video I'll show you how I made this homemade pop filter

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.888
you see here and it works really well. 

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:12.788
The materials needed are: 

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:17.800
firstly, a plastic cup. This one that I have here is Nocilla's, but 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.300
you can also use those little chocolate cups. 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.679
What matters is that the rim is hard plastic so it doesn't deform, 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.259
and the plastic cup must be wider at the rim than at the base. 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.729
Second, an old stocking. If you don't have one, you can find some 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.570
handkerchief or old shirt. 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.649
There has to be some sort of transparent material, because if too 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.310
thick, when speaking into the microphone it could not capture the voice well. 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.100
And third, optional, some type of metal wire. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.270
I say it's optional because it is what we'll use to make the support

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.090
that will attach the pop filter to the micro, but I know that not everyone 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.850
 has a wire of these at home. 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.710
 And the tools you'll need are: 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.519
A cutter to cut the plastic cup. You can also use a 

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:09.229
 knife or whatever you have on hand.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.379
A gimlet tool to make holes in the plastic. 

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:18.300
If not, you can use a punch, the tip of a knife or even the cutter.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.709
And a marker for marking where we will cut. 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.129
And now we get to the point. 

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:27.099
The first thing to do is cut the rim of the plastic cup at a distance 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.339
about 1,5 cm.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
You can make a mark to know where to cut. 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.060
And for cutting use the cutter. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.618
I'd recommend you do it slowly to keep the pulse and not damage

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:44.000
either sides, 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.189
because after that we'll need to cut a second ring of the glass. 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.340
That second ring should measure around half a centimeter. 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.329
And it would look like this:

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.739
one hand, we have the hoop with the hard edge and, on the other, the smaller hoop. 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:04.000
Now we take the gimlet tool and make a hole in the bottom of the large hoop, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.709
the one with the hard rim. 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.808
It must be large enough to pass the stocking through it; 

00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:13.519
preferably should be near the edge.

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.900
And you can optionally make a small hole on the left and another one on the right. 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.859
Why do I say "optional"? Because through these holes is how I 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.118
pass the wire to create the support, but you can come up with a different idea

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:28.679
to make the support. 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.000
Now we have to take the small ring and put it in the stocking. 

00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:39.740
You need to stretch it until the stocking is completely smooth 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.740
and we pass the stocking through the big hole of the hoop with thick border. 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.370
And finally all you have to do is fit the hoop with the stocking within 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.179
the big hoop. 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:03:00.829
Because of the hard rim of the plastic cup, it doesn't deform and keeps

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.489
its rounded shape. 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.688
And we have our homemade pop filter.

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:09.549
I made a knot.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.528
Is somewhat ugly, but so far I haven't come up with a better idea.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:18.818
To create the support I twisted the wire around the

00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:22.929
 microphone, leaving two bended ends.

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:27.348
And pass these ends through the two small holes I made before. 

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:32.159
I know that the result is not very elegant, but what matters is that it works. 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.938
And here's a test: first without the pop fiilter,

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:41.938
 and then with it.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.600
If you do not have a wire on hand you could do the support with a plastic bottle.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.718
You'd need to make a hole in the cap of the bottle and another hole 

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:56.519
in the large hoop and then pass a screw with a nut. 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.709
And the result would be like this. The downside to this system is that 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.509
you'd need to find a bottle with a suitable height and it would be 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:08.558
to leave the pop filter and the micro on a table, 

00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:12.788
but hey, it's a suggestion: maybe someone comes up with a best method. 

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:16.878
If you want my advice, I will recommend doing this pop filter

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.000
only if you have got all the materials at home. I say this because 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.620
I've seen online tutorials that show how to create a homemade pop filter

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.149
and the first thing they tell you is you have to go to a store and buy a hoop,

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:33.138
but I think that the point of this type of craft is that you can 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.028
 make them with things you already have;

00:04:35.028 --> 00:04:38.298
instead of spend money in buying some of the 

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:43.519
materials, maybe you should buy a real pop filter.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.000
I hope you enjoyed the video

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.598
and if anyone decides to made this pop filter, let me know!

00:04:47.598 --> 00:04:48.300
 See you soon!
