00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.260
 hello very good everyone here we are in 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.810
 a new video today I bring you a video 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.620
 it's not the usual of my series but 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:19.330
 good is a video mixed between a 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.340
 template about and player whereby 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.990
 save and good we start with the video 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.170
 as you can see is a mini envelope of 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.810
 silver is the daily gift never had 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.350
 I raised a daily gift practically not 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.350
 nothing comes out 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.980
 in no good an interesting shirt 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.980
 I'm missing the Orlando Pirates 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.960
 I really like the fifa 2010 that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.670
 it was the first kit in the black and 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.640
 it looked in the skulls but it's good 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.640
 well and good all this we discard 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.740
 and well we are going to what we are going I am going to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.540
 teach the template of the bundesliga 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.090
 now as you can see in many more 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.460
 templates 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.370
 I have proposed some like 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.580
 peru the berkeley that I already 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.800
 I will teach is not that it is very good 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.500
 but good is in projects so 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.280
 projects of some interesting player 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.530
 and they already speak will be good and we will see the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.790
 of the bundesliga 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.070
 update that we have added not great 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.890
 thing 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.790
 if bad memories are three players 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.930
 well here we see toys 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.690
 a very good center with 73 of pace is 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.000
 very good central who has 83 of 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.800
 defense and 82 header 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.880
 up nobody's going to cost me 31 thousand 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.740
 coins 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.549
 logical from above do not leave 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.140
 nobody an 87 very good central very good 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.050
 couple with hummels 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.180
 then from left half I have arango no 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.069
 I like nothing I put it because I want 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.130
 complete this template with if 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.010
 but good 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.770
 I have to try to get reus from 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.080
 left half I do not know if it will work well 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.950
 good at all but good at the moment 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.050
 we have arango that - the rhythm is 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.140
 fairly good 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.030
 but it could improve 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.480
 It also remains to say that this template 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.280
 since I have so much ships it's worse 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.100
 maybe it 's for the handicap so 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 It has become bad but I am doing very badly 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.459
 this template especially arango what 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.459
 I have to improve or I'm going for reus if 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.530
 ribéry what happens that ribéry is very 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.709
 expensive is too expensive is excessive 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.930
 price of ribery I do not know if it will be in 700 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.659
 a thousand coins I think I saw it or it may be 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.150
 in - I do not know it well but very expensive 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.290
 normal ribéry the eve impossible to go for 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.000
 him and good my great signing and of which you 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.180
 I recommend 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.730
 night and that departure this week 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.400
 he is a great player he is very good and the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.730
 Normal is very good I already had it but 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.010
 good 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.069
 I wanted to try this and the truth is not me 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.430
 I regret nothing very good player has 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.080
 an incredible good chute you can see here 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.129
 your stats but well let's go to the 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.910
 biography cost me 240 thousand coins very 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:42.810
 expensive very expensive car but it is very good 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.989
 very very very good player 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.280
 we will see here his rhythm states of 83 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.600
 that is very good have only gone up one 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.910
 point 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.790
 very good offensive midfielder 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.130
 shot 74 it is very good the shot that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.400
 has götze has an awesome cocoa 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.310
 pass 80 and some very good passes and dribble 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.340
 90 I think it has four stars 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.040
 of bad leg and four stars of 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.560
 dribble but good I'm not killer is not 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.269
 I care a lot but good that it costs 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.700
 a lot that releases the ball very good 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.330
 player goal I have to upload a 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.110
 match with this template to see if 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.030
 I win some game because I will have 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.850
 won some but I lost many with 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.250
 this template since I have it like this and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.260
 well I know you have told me some 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.289
 upload some game with this template and 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.389
 I will do it 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.509
 and well let's see this is the player 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.009
 that I recommend saving for the east is 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:50.389
 a player to save 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.849
 because it's very, very, very, very good, not 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.490
 I regret anything 240 thousand coins 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.259
 but I do not regret 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.639
 and then well let's see also what 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.630
 we have podolski here who also 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.630
 It has come out in an envelope 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.690
 9 a very good player I have to 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.070
 transform to training and mc or 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.540
 front center 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.480
 I would like to put it forward center 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.460
 by is wayne is not from Bundesliga but 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.139
 to be German the rapport is very 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.360
 good and 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.360
 I really like podolski has very good 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.370
 good shot you can see 87 shot 87 of 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.009
 80 dribble rhythm very good player 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.900
