it<00:00:18.420> actually<00:00:19.520> only<00:00:20.520> costs<00:00:21.150> 269<00:00:21.980> let's<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.100> if

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it actually only costs 269 let's see if

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.250 
it actually only costs 269 let's see if
I<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.430> better<00:00:23.580> focus<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:27.050> I'm<00:00:28.050> using

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I can get better focus for you I'm using

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.150 
I can get better focus for you I'm using
an<00:00:28.410> iPhone<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.820> costs<00:00:30.330> 269<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
an iPhone so it costs 269 and it is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.760 
an iPhone so it costs 269 and it is
cheaper<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.669> bigger<00:00:32.969> than<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> tetraman<00:00:33.840> I'm

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
cheaper and bigger than the tetraman I'm

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.200 
cheaper and bigger than the tetraman I'm
putting<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.130> next<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> lighter<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.969> size

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
putting it next to a lighter for size

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
putting it next to a lighter for size
comparison<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.230> fish

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
comparison here are my fish

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.270 
comparison here are my fish
the<00:00:38.660> tetraman<00:00:39.660> flakes<00:00:40.379> come<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:40.980> nice

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the tetraman flakes come with this nice

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.180 
the tetraman flakes come with this nice
little<00:00:41.960> slide<00:00:42.960> back<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:44.129> always

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
little slide back so you don't always

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
little slide back so you don't always
have<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> open<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> fish<00:00:47.070> food<00:00:48.590> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
there it floods back it can go all the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.910 
there it floods back it can go all the
way<00:00:53.250> back<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> crisps<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.710> come

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
way back these are the crisps they come

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.200 
way back these are the crisps they come
in<00:00:56.039> green<00:00:56.340> red<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> normal<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.440> red<00:00:58.649> are

water<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.680> nice<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> flake<00:01:44.369> food

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
water so that's nice the flake food

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.389 
water so that's nice the flake food
while<00:01:45.030> cheaper<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.560> looks<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.920> normal<00:01:47.220> flake

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
while cheaper it looks like normal flake

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
while cheaper it looks like normal flake
food<00:01:48.049> see<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.350> open<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.740> one-handed

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
food see if I can open this one-handed

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
food see if I can open this one-handed
right<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.409> has<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.560> little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
right so here it is it has a little

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.460 
right so here it is it has a little
middle<00:01:53.009> seen<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.430> way<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> food<00:01:54.470> it's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
middle seen one way of the food it's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.810 
middle seen one way of the food it's
right<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.100> can't<00:01:56.369> say<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> looks

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
right there I can't say it looks

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
right there I can't say it looks
particularly<00:01:57.240> appetizing<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.530> eat<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
particularly appetizing but just eat it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
particularly appetizing but just eat it
you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.490> crumble<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.030> which<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.270> nice<00:02:00.540> for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you can crumble it up which is nice for

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.280 
you can crumble it up which is nice for
baby<00:02:01.259> fish<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:02.159> otherwise<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.750> say<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
baby fish but otherwise I would say that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.389 
baby fish but otherwise I would say that
this<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.799> better<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.850> water

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.790 

my<00:02:09.000> fish<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.720> seem<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> prefer<00:02:10.379> these

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
my fish actually seem to prefer these

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.960 
my fish actually seem to prefer these
I'm<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.160> sure<00:02:11.580> why<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.180> they<00:02:12.989> do<00:02:13.200> so

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
I'm not sure why but they do so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.309 
I'm not sure why but they do so
