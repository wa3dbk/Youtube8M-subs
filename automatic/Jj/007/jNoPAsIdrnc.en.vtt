00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.400
 pascal title in game right today you 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.069
 can we talk a little bit about it yes 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 of course so the first title so 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 acquired it's a mixed doubles title 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.900
 with magali rousset and a title next 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 two in double gentlemen with richard 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.539
 so was my team partners 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.430
 from France and subsequently I managed to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.699
 get two titles in singles so 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 François brizard face and it was not 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.640
 won because franois really plays 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.330
 very very well I have a course 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 difficult 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.430
 it was necessary to manage three days of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.219
 competition with v very early I get 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.770
 I'm sleeping early I managed my 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.750
 recovery because there are a lot of 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 dates between matches and I learned 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 thanks to the international 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 it paid off I was very 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 happy to see the atmosphere that there was 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 during this competition in addition to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.020
 final many young people supported me 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 very strong when you're at the table it's 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 very pleasant 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 how was it part of an event 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.070
 like that's what you play a little bit more 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 before after or is it the tale 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.810
 everyday no I mean we 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.760
 trains yes for specific goals 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 after it's better not changed too much the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.909
 volume course of a year is better 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 do regular and since we're doing 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 training terms to do the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.490
 better quality that is to say 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.850
 not let go of a training point 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 work assisted technical points that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820
 make me maybe better 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 on the long term 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.340
 it's important to win 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 competitions like sahin went 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.259
 escaped to three is magnificent 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.509
 beautiful competition 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.200
 it was hard to get a medal at the jo 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.729
 is it maybe a little bit 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.509
 - just won the championships of 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.950
 france well it helped we did not know 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.479
 not because I remember my 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.920
 first competition in adapted sport where 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.079
 I had just won and three titles 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.530
 in mixed doubles doubles and 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.460
 simple 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.049
 I was really happy we were stranded I was 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.340
 amazed at what I had done and I 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.399
 found that this competition had 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 enormously important and I can not 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.429
 say there is a competition that has 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.869
 much more importance than the other 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.539
 it's a bit true at the games level 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.940
 because the games are diving in 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.989
 polite terms it's really knows the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.910
 supreme competition 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.769
 it goes a little before the championships 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.790
 of the world but championships of France n1 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.390
 so much that they would like to be 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.030
 champion of France 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 I meet you that's where the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.549
 most beautiful title of this weekend is the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.829
 double gentlemen it was pretty simple 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.310
 for me why because it's already 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:35.319
 that's after three days of work 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.190
 hard to win the gold medals 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.790
 continued to go all the way 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.989
 to arrive first 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.630
 at the end while we are tired 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.069
 nervously we're all ah no it's 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.569
 beautiful to finish in beauty I find 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.829
 I had but I wanted to win 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.370
 three shocks the three men in the 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.010
 world importance we saw 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.390
 we saw a lot of support support to 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.680
 once you've won too I believe 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.569
 that so much more encouragement 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.310
 how is it a little iron 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.900
 launches discipline 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.480
 how is it done I already think that of 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.299
 made available the right way with 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.110
 your it's important to show that 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.829
 precisely after complicated care we 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.390
 can get to do the sport of very 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.159
 high level because it's not just me 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.140
 in which are very high level 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.819
 I showed them a path that is 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.239
 possible they seem to like it 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.670
 many they recognize in me and 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.239
 So, they are enormously 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.069
 encourage I was too happy r it's 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.269
 it's still one of my best moments 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.500
 for justin that's for sure and then even when 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.209
 I was at the games in London it was 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.790
 like the French were stopped 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.530
 he wanted us to win this title finally 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.959
 this medal to support him because 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.340
 that it's a noble cause I mean 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.659
 it's not easy to care 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.700
 around the world when we have an illness 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.530
 psychological against the therapy by 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.630
 the sport must believe that it works it's 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.090
 I am the example seven years ago 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.799
 of wise and a hospital 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.319
 today I am rather sharpened I 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.139
 am rather much better I found 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.910
 a responsibility that I wish to 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.870
 everybody 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.310
 today what is your margin 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.180
 progress progression margin 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:22.300
 I think it is high 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.200
 I think it is because of a 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.300
 mental point of view i think that 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.620
 it may be difficult to evolve 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.980
 because I have losses of 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.680
 concentration of the hammam said the games 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.750
 is silent for example the third set in 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.220
 final is a little bit like a point 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.320
 from technical point of view I have so many people 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.150
 around me who works hard and who 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.220
 are very knowledgeable hervé drunkard 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.930
 because she will scabbard it flag 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.810
 jeans if there are many others huh I 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.090
 exploded me not hesitate but I think about 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.990
 them all the time he sees well that in 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.540
 my game evolves it evolves again it's 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.770
 to say that I can switch to this exchange 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.140
 currently competing with those of 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.490
 my club especially I see myself well past 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.200
 to 10 exchanges and then we come across top to 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.500
 a big pace so I feel that there is 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.020
 technology - a big big France 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.650
 room for improvement 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.900
 in addition salty strong point the forehand 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.730
 I can still I can still advance his 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.290
 debt 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.130
 to me well applied the 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.070
 instructions from my coaches and then evolved 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.130
 at the international level yet any 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.330
 way are a lot of things to work 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.830
 in table tennis 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.030
 it's not that its weak points are 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.350
 strengths there is also what is 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.880
 relatively average here I'm doing 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.950
 account that it is possible to evolve 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.630
 really in my game in terms 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.770
 goals 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.240
 the first thing we could 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.540
 wish there is more room 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.340
 for rio games in adapted sport 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.600
 it means more competition for 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.720
 you also means more 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.400
 competition for me too I'd like 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.560
 although there is a French who 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.750
 accompany me minimum to the games of rio 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.770
 nîmes men I would rather see 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.930
 four hard cds my friends and girlfriends 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.789
 and 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.169
 from a personal point of view what we 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.520
 could wish it is to have a 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.750
 new medal to rio to be champion 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.389
 of the world because I passed the title 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.970
 it will be a fight at the end of the year to be 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.600
 european champion in singles game is 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.400
 not in simple 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.070
 I'm going to double that I was vice 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.030
 european champion last time the 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.729
 world championships I had done 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.400
 four quarter -finals with four 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.419
 beautiful in the four paintings I hope 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.770
 that it will be at least a medal and 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:45.370
 then a title to my titles like that 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.020
 changes every day with motivation 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.430
 yes it changes a life huh that's for sure 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:55.360
 it's when it's like 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.340
 example peter pan he will leave in at 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.320
 dreamland to do what they 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.180
 wanted me that's it I 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.639
 I was a table tennis buff 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.840
 since the age of 10 I did not want to 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:08.440
 let go because I found my sport 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.289
 fantastic having titles like that that 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.810
 it's not that it makes me laugh is that 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:18.120
 my dream became reality 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.120
 so I have some in the country of Peter Pan
