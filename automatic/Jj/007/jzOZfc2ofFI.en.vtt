00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.260

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.250

 that information we have to be kind 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.600
 verbal violence does not solve anything that 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.820
 cute of you that defends me is 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.760

 sex never in this case spits the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.690
 information from a bitch slut of 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.360
 shit we need to save the world 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.060

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.369
 falling fucking bastards 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.799
 you do not know what it is to respect a 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.470
 lady only thinks about sex and drugs 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.049
 men are crap worth what 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.150
 I'm sorry I was joking now yeah 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.950
 Miss please could I give you the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.950
 information that you have collected in these 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.150
 moments do not go clowning because if 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.580
 it does not open anything 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.460
 each cup nutella virus information 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.550
 the world depends on it is fine 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.290
 while you were traveling I 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.660
 I was looking for information about the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.460
 responsible for that attack and I found 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.110
 a subject that according to him is a 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.510
 survivor of the explosion of 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.520
 stadium I asked him about what was 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.140
 seen before the explosion and he 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.360
 he replied that he had seen a robot 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.910
 floating heading to a huge ship 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.580
 equal to what we saw that day I assumed that 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.310
 Servo that mentions is behind everything 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.550
 this and that he is not alone he alone are 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.100
 henchman of the true responsible 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.100
 that's the information I 've heard 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.250
 wait a moment and I remembered that it was the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.350
 son of a bitch that destroyed the stadium in 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.620
 serious are you kidding me 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.440
 let's go bad let's go with nonsense is not 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.600
 necessary that I invent is something funny 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.730
 it's no joke seriously I just 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.370
 remember who is responsible 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.920
 his name is being ministry if an evil 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.200
 I do not remember but have still minister 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.080
 It is perhaps drugged that is the name most 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.450
 ridiculous that you came up with and my mom saw 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.700
 what it looked like was ten thousand seven 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.160
 solutions the same ones that you just 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.470
 to say was a kind of floating robbery 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.660
 that he used a strange bomb and had to 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.299
 sacrifice innocent robots to 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.970
 that exploited someone could say of 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.310
 what the hell are they talking about coincidence 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.340
 neighborhood is this subject of which you are 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.970
 speaking caracoto to lucena of course 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.280
 what is he 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.620
 that is the robot that destroyed the stadium 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.680
 like rays you have a picture of him 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.560
 I found on the Internet at the time 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 you said is the name of the subject hahahaha 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.299
 internet is the fucking I love very well guys 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.519
 Now that we know who the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.069
 responsible we have to find it and 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.950
 destroy it and how work do you think 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.069
 find it possibly at the end of 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.870
 this road of shit we'll find 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.540
 fuck magic because I did not think of you 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.609
 idea is extremely cool stop 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.700
 make you the funny fuck this is a 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.170
 moment d 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.000
 We need to find that fucking robot 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.640
 shit and you have not helped in anything 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.180
 you're just saying bullshit without 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.860
 sorry I'm sorry let me get here I promise 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.440
 be completely serious in these 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.170
 moments I think we should and give a 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.450
 plan to catch her has no reason to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.160
 lucena I think that the other one but yes 20 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.070
 rohe not to tell us everything that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.410
 you know there's a red in that plan does not work 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.930
 nothing to interrogate him since he is a robot 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.840
 it would not do any good and the second 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.390
 catch it will not solve anything and then 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.880
 that you want to do, I think that what 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.130
 let's kill for the sake of others because 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.230
 if we catch him and let live as 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.530
 possible it is that it escapes and can destroy 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.690
 other important areas fuck mario like 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.120
 you can say that we do not kill like that 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.010
 I remember something kitsch we are talking about 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.470
 of a robot a robot that does not have 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.960
 feelings a robot that killed thousands 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.360
 of people a robot that destroyed one of 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.790
 the most important stadiums that robot 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.610
 it must be destroyed I think mario has 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.220
 reason we have no other alternative 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.010
 we must destroy that grandfather faster 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.020
 very good I am with you I am 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.330
 excited to take down that robot 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.910
 Although I have never destroyed anything in my 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.830
 I remind you that it 's for the good of 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.740
 world although I have a bad feeling 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.170
 of something about what mario is about 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.330
 the rebound efe I'm not a little 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.580
 worried about the pitch I wonder what 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.890
 It will be gone I did not know anything about it 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.960
 since they sent me to fly calm 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.730
 Mario, I assure you that the pizza is very 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.290
 well the safest thing is that it is 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.990
 waiting comfortably in the kingdom 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.400
 mushroom that is but pete is the only 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.220
