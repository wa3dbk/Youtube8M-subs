after my video simple Swiss chard on how
to<00:00:03.449> click<00:00:03.780> Swiss<00:00:04.020> chard<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.560> was<00:00:04.740> asked<00:00:04.980> if<00:00:05.700> I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
to click Swiss chard I was asked if I

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.880 
to click Swiss chard I was asked if I
can<00:00:05.940> make<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> video<00:00:06.450> on<00:00:06.899> how<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.109> gross<00:00:07.649> this

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
can make a video on how I gross this

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.509 
can make a video on how I gross this
chart<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.059> go<00:00:09.469> we<00:00:10.469> plant<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:10.889> Swiss<00:00:11.160> chard

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
chart here we go we plant my Swiss chard

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.490 
chart here we go we plant my Swiss chard
right<00:00:11.730> into<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> ground<00:00:12.599> seed<00:00:13.080> right<00:00:13.320> into

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
right into the ground seed right into

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.030 
right into the ground seed right into
the<00:00:13.590> ground

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the ground

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.460 
the ground
but<00:00:14.250> because<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.389> still<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.809> plants<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.289> are

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
but because I still have plants that are

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.040 
but because I still have plants that are
producing<00:00:17.039> good<00:00:17.100> leaves<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.940> will<00:00:18.180> start<00:00:18.779> them

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
producing good leaves I will start them

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.439 
producing good leaves I will start them
in<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.320> little<00:00:19.590> containers<00:00:20.460> I've<00:00:21.090> got<00:00:21.270> some

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
in these little containers I've got some

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
in these little containers I've got some
expose<00:00:21.869> above<00:00:22.199> ones<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.250> got<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
expose above ones here I got some of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.060 
expose above ones here I got some of
these<00:00:24.210> plastic<00:00:24.570> ones<00:00:25.140> from<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.529> neighbor<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
these plastic ones from my neighbor that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.480 
these plastic ones from my neighbor that
recently<00:00:26.550> bought<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:27.150> flowers<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.949> that'll

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
recently bought some flowers and that'll

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
recently bought some flowers and that'll
work<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.849> good<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.480> by<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:30.779> these

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
work out good because by the time these

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
work out good because by the time these
are<00:00:31.410> growing<00:00:31.980> established<00:00:32.790> enough<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.329> put

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
are growing established enough to be put

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.020 
are growing established enough to be put
into<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.930> ground<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:35.190> other<00:00:35.370> ones<00:00:35.640> should<00:00:35.940> be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
into the ground my other ones should be

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.630 
into the ground my other ones should be
finished<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.860> that'll<00:00:37.860> mean<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.340> won't<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
finished and that'll mean I won't have

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
finished and that'll mean I won't have
to<00:00:38.850> wait<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.030> long<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.379> Swiss

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
to wait very long for some one Swiss

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.209 
to wait very long for some one Swiss
chard<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.280> ready<00:00:41.660> now<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.190> now

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
chard to be ready now you just see now

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.000 
chard to be ready now you just see now
it's<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.579> half<00:00:44.700> inch<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.829> your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it's a half inch you know is make your

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.139 
it's a half inch you know is make your
holes<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> plant<00:00:49.969> more<00:00:50.969> than

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
holes now if you want to plant more than

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.069 
holes now if you want to plant more than
one<00:00:51.300> seed<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.870> ensure<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.239> plant

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
one seed to ensure you get a plant

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010 
one seed to ensure you get a plant
I<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.860> space<00:00:56.579> some<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.600> about<00:00:57.840> an

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I would space some you know about an

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.750 
I would space some you know about an
inch<00:00:58.260> use<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> larger<00:00:59.039> container<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.699> this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
inch use a larger container like this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
inch use a larger container like this
and<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.949> better<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:04.339> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and that way it's better to because you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.760 
and that way it's better to because you
don't<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:05.850> plants<00:01:06.390> together

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
don't have all these plants together

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
don't have all these plants together
fighting<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> nutrients<00:01:09.030> you'll<00:01:09.600> have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
fighting for the nutrients you'll have

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
fighting for the nutrients you'll have
one<00:01:09.960> plant<00:01:10.350> by<00:01:11.130> itself<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
one plant by itself which will have a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
one plant by itself which will have a
better<00:01:12.689> chance<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:15.619> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> look<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
better chance I think if you look at the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.520 
better chance I think if you look at the
Swiss<00:01:17.520> chard<00:01:17.880> seed<00:01:18.330> you'll<00:01:18.900> notice<00:01:19.259> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
Swiss chard seed you'll notice that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.920 
Swiss chard seed you'll notice that
there<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.330> there's<00:01:21.540> three

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
there look like this and there's three

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.310 
there look like this and there's three
little<00:01:22.200> things<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> end<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.939> believe<00:01:24.750> these

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
little things on the end I believe these

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.580 
little things on the end I believe these
are<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> actual<00:01:26.189> seeds<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:28.080> seeds<00:01:28.320> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
are the actual seeds and the seeds this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.550 
are the actual seeds and the seeds this
have<00:01:29.390> several<00:01:30.390> seeds<00:01:30.720> together<00:01:30.960> because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
have several seeds together because

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
have several seeds together because
every<00:01:31.829> time<00:01:32.040> I've<00:01:32.280> planted<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:33.210> seed<00:01:33.750> I've

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
every time I've planted one seed I've

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.999 
every time I've planted one seed I've
gotten<00:01:35.100> two<00:01:35.400> sometimes<00:01:35.850> three<00:01:36.150> plants<00:01:37.009> now

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
gotten two sometimes three plants now

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.819 
gotten two sometimes three plants now
after<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.090> plants<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> grown<00:01:39.930> enough<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
after the plants have grown enough we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
after the plants have grown enough we
can<00:01:41.070> tell<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> difference<00:01:41.909> between<00:01:42.060> each

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
can tell the difference between each

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960 
can tell the difference between each
other<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.829> come<00:01:44.070> along<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.729> your

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
other you can come along take your

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
other you can come along take your
fingernails<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.750> something<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.979> carefully

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
fingernails or something very carefully

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.210 
fingernails or something very carefully
cut<00:01:47.880> off<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.299> top<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:49.530> pull<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.920> out

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
cut off the top don't pull it out

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.270 
cut off the top don't pull it out
because<00:01:51.110> they're<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.409> close<00:01:52.680> together<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
because they're so close together that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
because they're so close together that
the<00:01:53.640> roots<00:01:53.960> might<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.500> tangled<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> might

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the roots might be tangled and you might

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.020 
the roots might be tangled and you might
damage<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.210> plant<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> keep<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.159> grew

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
damage the plant you want to keep I grew

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.690 
damage the plant you want to keep I grew
rainbow<00:02:00.570> chard<00:02:00.770> I've<00:02:01.770> noticed<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> different

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
rainbow chard I've noticed the different

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
rainbow chard I've noticed the different
colors<00:02:03.030> grow<00:02:03.360> differently<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.140> shape<00:02:04.469> size

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
colors grow differently in shape size

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.600 
colors grow differently in shape size
and<00:02:04.860> speed<00:02:05.490> I've<00:02:06.299> noticed<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.320> real<00:02:07.979> red<00:02:08.340> one

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and speed I've noticed the real red one

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.470 
and speed I've noticed the real red one
seems<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.450> grow<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.080> quickest<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
seems to grow the quickest and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.010 
seems to grow the quickest and
fullest<00:02:11.959> largest<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:14.000> yellow<00:02:14.420> ones<00:02:14.690> seem

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
fullest largest and the yellow ones seem

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.400 
fullest largest and the yellow ones seem
to<00:02:15.170> grow<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.800> slowest<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.459> smallest<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.410> have

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
to grow the slowest and smallest I have

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.740 
to grow the slowest and smallest I have
planted<00:02:19.129> more<00:02:19.340> than<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:19.760> plant<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.420> next

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
planted more than one plant right next

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.680 
planted more than one plant right next
to<00:02:20.810> each<00:02:20.930> other<00:02:21.459> if<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.670> gets<00:02:22.879> good<00:02:23.090> Sun<00:02:23.150> from

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
to each other if it gets good Sun from

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.900 
to each other if it gets good Sun from
the<00:02:23.750> side<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.500> seems<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.920> grow<00:02:25.129> okay<00:02:25.550> but<00:02:25.760> it's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
the side it seems to grow okay but it's

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.940 
the side it seems to grow okay but it's
really<00:02:26.090> recommended<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.290> grow<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.739> in

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
really recommended just to grow one in

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.009 
really recommended just to grow one in
one<00:02:28.130> spot<00:02:28.599> they<00:02:29.599> put<00:02:29.870> apart<00:02:31.450> because<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.810> had<00:02:32.989> a

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
one spot they put apart because I had a

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.720 
one spot they put apart because I had a
limited<00:02:33.590> amount<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.950> area<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.519> thought

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
limited amount of area and I thought

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.020 
limited amount of area and I thought
some<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.239> seats<00:02:35.569> wouldn't<00:02:36.050> grow<00:02:36.349> I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
some of the seats wouldn't grow I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.059 
some of the seats wouldn't grow I
planted<00:02:38.030> them<00:02:38.209> all<00:02:38.450> bunched<00:02:38.840> up<00:02:39.140> but<00:02:39.380> as<00:02:39.799> you

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
planted them all bunched up but as you

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.059 
planted them all bunched up but as you
can<00:02:40.250> see<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.730> ones<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:42.410> get<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.830> best

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
can see the ones that don't get the best

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.350 
can see the ones that don't get the best
Sun<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:44.299> didn't<00:02:44.630> grow<00:02:45.910> like<00:02:46.910> for<00:02:47.299> example

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
Sun just didn't grow like for example

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
Sun just didn't grow like for example
these<00:02:47.989> two<00:02:48.049> but<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.950> other<00:02:49.099> ones<00:02:49.370> are<00:02:49.549> very

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
these two but the other ones are very

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.119 
these two but the other ones are very
large

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
want to space them about a foot apart in

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.280 
want to space them about a foot apart in
rows<00:03:06.219> and<00:03:06.670> make<00:03:06.790> sure<00:03:06.999> the<00:03:07.180> rows<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:07.749> well

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
spaced enough to walk in between now

people<00:03:13.810> cut<00:03:14.139> off<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.620> entire<00:03:14.980> plant<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:16.019> it's

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
people cut off the entire plant but it's

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.319 
people cut off the entire plant but it's
a<00:03:17.079> good<00:03:17.290> idea<00:03:17.650> what<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.040> do<00:03:18.159> I<00:03:18.340> just<00:03:18.459> cut<00:03:18.939> off<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
a good idea what I do I just cut off the

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.479 
a good idea what I do I just cut off the
outer<00:03:19.359> edges<00:03:19.840> it'll<00:03:20.349> keep<00:03:20.560> producing<00:03:21.010> new

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
outer edges it'll keep producing new

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.629 
outer edges it'll keep producing new
leaves<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.120> several<00:03:22.569> months<00:03:23.159> and<00:03:24.159> another

leaves for several months and another
thing<00:03:24.969> I<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.329> do<00:03:25.629> is<00:03:25.989> come<00:03:26.409> by<00:03:26.620> about

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
thing I like to do is come by about

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.000 
thing I like to do is come by about
every<00:03:27.700> few<00:03:28.450> weeks<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.019> put<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.260> little<00:03:29.409> handful

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
every few weeks and put a little handful
