 prehispanic elite had so much 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.690
 importance that was reflected in a

 similar to those in Europe 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.690
 possibly this was one of the causes 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.880
 that led to a decline in their consumption 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.490
