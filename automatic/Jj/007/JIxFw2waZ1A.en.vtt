take<00:00:39.690> quite<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.899> long<00:00:39.930> time<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.530> just

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
take quite a long time and it's just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
take quite a long time and it's just
kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> unknowable<00:00:41.670> tedious<00:00:42.180> i<00:00:42.270> guess<00:00:42.450> after

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
kind of unknowable tedious i guess after

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
kind of unknowable tedious i guess after
a<00:00:42.780> while<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.140> i<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.620> thought<00:00:43.770> I'd<00:00:43.980> sort

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
a while but i just thought I'd sort

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.590 
a while but i just thought I'd sort
through<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:45.120> why<00:00:45.270> had<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
through and actually see why had in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450 
through and actually see why had in
there<00:00:45.780> try<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.350> organize<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.370> I've

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
there try and organize it see if I've

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.069 
there try and organize it see if I've
got<00:00:47.489> anything<00:00:47.789> worth<00:00:48.090> keeping<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.840> didn't

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
got anything worth keeping it didn't

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.940 
got anything worth keeping it didn't
really<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.260> too<00:00:49.530> long<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.920> through

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
really take too long to go through

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
really take too long to go through
probably<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.550> 15<00:00:51.059> 20<00:00:51.300> minutes<00:00:51.449> I'd<00:00:51.750> say<00:00:51.960> so

probably<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> end<00:01:40.229> something<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
probably in the end something like that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.310 
actually spoke to a few people and they
said<00:04:59.820> that<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.600> kind<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.960> waste<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.260> money

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
even have to be a loop tab anymore it

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.719 
even have to be a loop tab anymore it
can<00:05:30.630> literally<00:05:30.870> just<00:05:31.110> be<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.260> tab<00:05:31.530> of<00:05:31.560> like<00:05:32.430> full

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
really awesome ideas to you guys have

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.409 
really awesome ideas to you guys have
just<00:05:37.950> literally<00:05:38.669> let<00:05:38.820> me<00:05:38.910> know<00:05:39.030> it<00:05:39.270> really

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
just literally let me know it really

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.909 
just literally let me know it really
helped<00:05:39.630> me<00:05:39.690> decide<00:05:39.990> but<00:05:40.200> as<00:05:40.350> you<00:05:40.530> can<00:05:40.620> see<00:05:40.770> I

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
helped me decide but as you can see I

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.830 
helped me decide but as you can see I
did<00:05:41.130> high<00:05:41.310> alch<00:05:41.460> maroon<00:05:41.850> items<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.510> make<00:05:42.630> some

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
did high alch maroon items to make some

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.390 
did high alch maroon items to make some
more<00:05:42.960> money<00:05:43.080> because<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.590> high<00:05:43.770> oak<00:05:43.890> value<00:05:44.190> is

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
more money because the high oak value is

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.980 
more money because the high oak value is
generally<00:05:44.940> better<00:05:45.120> for<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.570> rune<00:05:45.690> items

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
generally better for the rune items

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.420 
generally better for the rune items
anyway<00:05:46.289> so<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.530> thought<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:46.800> just<00:05:47.010> do<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.250> is

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
anyway so I thought I just do that is

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.460 
anyway so I thought I just do that is
better<00:05:47.940> than<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.210> grand<00:05:48.450> exchange<00:05:48.630> prices<00:05:49.260> so

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
better than the grand exchange prices so

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.960 
better than the grand exchange prices so
after<00:05:49.770> doing<00:05:49.890> that<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.280> selling<00:05:50.550> all<00:05:50.669> my<00:05:50.789> loop

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
after doing that and selling all my loop

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.580 
after doing that and selling all my loop
you<00:05:51.390> can<00:05:51.539> now<00:05:51.690> see<00:05:51.930> that<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.080> managed<00:05:52.289> to<00:05:52.320> get<00:05:52.530> a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
you can now see that I managed to get a

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.200 
you can now see that I managed to get a
total<00:05:52.979> of<00:05:53.100> eight<00:05:53.250> point<00:05:53.550> one<00:05:53.580> mil<00:05:53.940> which<00:05:54.030> is

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
total of eight point one mil which is

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.360 
total of eight point one mil which is
pretty<00:05:54.479> nice<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:55.380> best<00:05:55.650> part<00:05:55.890> of<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:56.039> is<00:05:56.130> that

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
pretty nice the best part of it is that

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.580 
pretty nice the best part of it is that
i<00:05:57.000> haven't<00:05:57.360> sold<00:05:57.630> on<00:05:57.750> my<00:05:57.810> items<00:05:58.169> like<00:05:58.289> i<00:05:58.380> told
