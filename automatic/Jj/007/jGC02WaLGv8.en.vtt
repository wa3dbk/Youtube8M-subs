00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.610
 hello to all the friends of youtube here 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.680
 of micro and good bringing you a 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.840
 surprising pack of mods and good this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
 it's a pack of motorcycles that brings comes with 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.110
 I think 15 mod yes 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.550
 I think the 213 about 13 are from jobs and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.960
 the others are of use in the sense of 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:48.140
 monsters that are voices and another one the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.110
 dwarf a demoniac 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.079
 let's kill them good and the others I think 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.540
 which are the other 2 food 13 or 13 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.470
 they are monsters and the other two are from 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.350
 food a weapon that allows us to kill 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.040
 to all the monsters there are codes for 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.979
 remove it the spams and the items in your 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.159
 rival but they walk or you get a 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.740
 spam of one of a cost or you do not see yourself 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.869
 they take you all out and you get one 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.700
 it is better to take out the creative also 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.280
 can create in survival that 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.259
 then I'm going to show you and good for 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.020
 take out a creative have to go to the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.630
 part this of the blocks these 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 they are here and they will have all the spots 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 meals 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.859
 and also the sword of this one called 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.210
 clean monster that just touching 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:46.580
 we kill a monster 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.580
 but that does not give us what we do not European 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.960
 let's kill him now 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.230
 let's put all the monsters as 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 there is missing this 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.110
 well first we start with the mandilÃ³n 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.890
 of two heads which is this one that is 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.330
 great second hello 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.380
 they mutate that comes to us as a plan one is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 jmas and jelly but good after 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.400
 we follow the chocolate bar man 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 that is sure if we kill the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.110
 chocolate able because I could not kill him 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.500
 because they are very difficult to kill they have 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.400
 too much life and the sword is that one 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.830
 use to kill the sword kill monsters 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.050
 what it does is that that is the most the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.610
 they kill but they do not give you anything so they do not 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.710
 it serves more to see with that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.870
 the mutant robot 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.960
 the two-headed lenderman that is 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.260
 great tool the red monster that 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.190
 it's a zombie to raise the brightness a bit 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.500
 to see there is no good to see me no no no 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.310
 they are going to hit me the nba 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.310
 or at night 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.430
 there we have the red man 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.030
 and creative 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.409
 they were going to see the mutant robot the brother 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.120
 it's almost good to show the robot 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:28.510
 this n is quite this after 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.489
 this one after this one after this one and this one 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.210
 first with the mutant robot that he 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.220
 same but be different 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.430
 after the coach for what is a 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.400
 stick no more 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:46.840
 you return so one like those but 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.840
 light blue after the boom and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.030
 that is, you can not explain what it is 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.120
 rare 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.629
 I do not know what could be 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.040
 then it is time that this is a 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.350
 It can not be teletransported 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.760
 and then 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.019
 is the weather that is a zombie 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.019
 something that catches fire 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.549
 to see I'm missing 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.549
 so the last one is the mutant clipper 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.680
 look we approach where it explodes 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.690
 It floats like a normal but a little 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.950
 better and good to show all 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.680
 monsters the monster sword too 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.570
 you can craft jarre clean monsters or 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.510
 it is killed by a blow but do not have what 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.820
 that european so but they are also 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.820
 invincible almost impossible to kill 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.650
 it is very impossible to try to mark it 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.420
 because they are very strong 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.270
 to see this is going to kill him 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.060
 and well let's move on to show you that 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.000
 if you can change 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.420
 for example let's grab a table 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.420
 craft eo 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:10.420
 we grab many wooden planks 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.280
 we grab 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.280
 minerals and articles 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.270
 the gold ingot we add a lot 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.270
 food 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.350
 apples in an apple 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.080
 and a good golden carrot are going to the 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.620
 table you recorded or 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.449
 and they can spend and this and if they make a 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.479
 stick the crafter of these things is simple 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.100
 it's a palÃ© a coso but it gives us 9 I do not know 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.500
 why strange reason 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.240
 and we have the apple that also of the 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.000
 nine that's fine 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.470
 we can not also be the melon and for 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.020
 do spawn eggs what 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.980
 we need is to have need 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.160
 dye dye this what you mark 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.030
 need dye because the dye is not 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.129
 it can change nor can you get 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:10.260
 We are web no egg egg 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:12.960
 but nothing diamond porn 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.139
 diverse 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.879
 coal egg egg egg egg egg 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.879

 bone rope with back to wheat bread in 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.980
 this web 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.730
 and well we can also tweak the 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.520
 spam like kraft has a space in 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.340
 the other or the all have the same 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.080

 without exception of any 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.470
 and good 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:55.640
 is I think that that would be all is a mod that 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.620
 that is, it would be a bit like a pack 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.490
 mont because all these heap look 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.780

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.750
 15 mods 13 are monsters and two and two 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:12.760
