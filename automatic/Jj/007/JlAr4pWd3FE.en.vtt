00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.770
 hello i welcome you to the premiere 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.760
 Followed by Sheldon Cooper 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.280
 fun welcome long he 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.400
 to a new snapshot review he today 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.290
 the flags update so to speak I thought 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.590
 The saying of Sheldon Cooper fits in perfectly 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.390
 Well 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.759
 and yes, what's revolutionary? 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 today in minecraft update yes we have 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.340
 now flank in minecraft and yes it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.079
 There is quite like the rockets at that time 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 Many combinations like asking this question 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.440
 can now create with different 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.730
 eyeing colors and so on I have 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 here, for example, an example 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 made here the normal white light can 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 Show it again briefly how to do that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.980
 whole costs we take a stick take 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.390
 then what color do we want here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.110
 white then we get a white 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 flag we take yellow, for example 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 we get a yellow flag namely 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 usually without yellow out strangely 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.770
 I created a white banner 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 not if its bug is like it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.460
 noticed if I changed that then 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.110
 it somehow does not change with any 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:28.049
 I do not know why but I'll show you now 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.659
 the whole how that's okay now that's it 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.619
 something vague that is with the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.810
 no idea why I show 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 now that's here and should it with 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.880
 normal head does not take it 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.659
 we can get a kripo head now 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.330
 Use every skull around the flag 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.479
 to color somehow when ev school comes 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.630
 eg a pirate flag out and here eg 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.200
 stop ne kripo flag 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.930
 okay that's really magic the top in 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.579
 his video and kripo works completely 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.170
 The whole thing can be written about 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.329
 every time we do it in others 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.100
 By the way, skull can take this one 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.050
 now in the famila also you could get 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.120
 Before that , almost all get 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.790
 because now you get all the others 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.860
 by having a charged kripo that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.709
 level of lightning if 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.010
 if such a another monster high 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.190
 acts and then they only troop theirs 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.530
 otherwise we do not take skulls, for example 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.220
 to the bbi and wants to look at different 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.930
 what happens in the zombie nothing 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.080
 works then only works 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.090
 the penalty notice shows what is coming 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.670
 get out flag or something in the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.790
 We can do it with a little bit of a blessing 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.620
 now even more customized by us 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.720
 here for example a tile 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 want to dye or if we are now in the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.560
 can also make a circle 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.709
 circle in the middle says now 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.930
 So we have what we need now 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.480
 of it here with a bruise 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.180
 We can change that as well if we can 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.269
 here you can now the corners 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.920
 change or change all over then 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.739
 the whole upper corner is in it 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.340
 only the respective corner and 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.880
 Here then the middle circle changes 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.230
 or how to make this triangle now 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.670
 or something I do not have it yet 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.680
 found out right a skull 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.480
 I'll take another skull then 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.280
 I have not tried it yet but me 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.280
 I did not think it worked 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.530
 So there are many possibilities here 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.599
 because there are still definite ones 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.280
 a list showed everything like that 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.380
 Combination are actually it was 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.750
 planned to be able to carry these here 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.010
 but somehow it is not 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.280
 maybe a bug but on one 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 picture of chep you could see that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.470
 whole 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.670
 Part can be worn as well 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.599
 So do not just put it up 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.120
 even on the back wear so to speak 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.830
 why I have heads here is completely 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.570
 just because they are now in the 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.280
 inventory then displayed with the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.889
 matching skin and they got bigger 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.680
 He did not make that second child 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.790
 superimposed is that means having it 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.830
 we have the effect of making me a giant 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.169
 Skull hears when I make my own skin 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.550
 on off is normal says giant skull 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.900
 and mission pack noticed 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.889
 if you notice this moment 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.400
 it does not happen now 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.320
 Every day the sed becomes the trapdoor 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.630
 to brown with me I do not know if it 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.510
 because of my texture pack or whether the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.840
 in vanilla and but for trouble 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.979
 is there still with the trap doors no 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.070
 no broadcast will be damaged 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.260
 senior small example for Prince 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.870
 rendering that finally multi 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.639
 streaming is and several chambers now 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.280
 I'm hoping for something 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.389
 there just now the same example with 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.599
 f3 and yes you can be his long with f3 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:23.160
 a chance ground sorry if you can 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:26.470
 whole now do not make f3 and moment 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.270
 hf three ahs tooltips 11 3 and a says 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.370
 says it is much faster now 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.890
 as previously 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.720
 is really fast so i know 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.030
 not now if that works so fast because 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.100
 I have a ssd in it as hard disk 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.710
 or if it's normal too, so fast 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.090
 other people would have no idea it 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.270
 Just try it out how fast it is 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.170
 with you is in principle it was for today 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.500
 otherwise I have nothing 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:01.010
 to forget 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.570
 nÃ¶ except that now here the f3 and was 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.580
 as I said it's the tooltips 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.580
 it shows down how much energy 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.890
 the day after, for example, are at Bern 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.060
 is logical that in the nbc text 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.680
 automatically on it if you already 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.530
 drives or skat 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.930
 even if you have certain names now 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:23.060
 he uses it okay that's it then 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.930
 I thank you for watching and until 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.930
 next time
