00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
40 inches high so they were working

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.080 
40 inches high so they were working

again will go down as they're a 16 and a

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.880 
again will go down as they're a 16 and a
half<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:49.170> other<00:02:49.320> thing<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:49.620> nice<00:02:49.830> about

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
half the other thing that's nice about

half the other thing that's nice about
the<00:02:50.250> speed<00:02:50.520> supplies<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.450> don't<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:51.840> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the speed supplies is you don't have to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.370 
the speed supplies is you don't have to
stack<00:02:52.350> them<00:02:52.790> uniformly<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.570> can<00:02:54.690> stack<00:02:55.200> them

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
stack them uniformly you can stack them

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
action takes place so that's what we

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.739

want and need the most ability if we had

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.119 
want and need the most ability if we had
still<00:05:48.749> face<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.169> plate<00:05:49.379> and<00:05:49.589> the<00:05:49.800> bolts

for a deflection on this end but I lose

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.459 
for a deflection on this end but I lose
some<00:05:59.879> of<00:05:59.909> that<00:05:59.999> as<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.479> move<00:06:00.719> toward<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.199> end<00:06:01.379> of

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
some of that as I move toward the end of

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.129 
some of that as I move toward the end of
the<00:06:01.559> product<00:06:02.099> you<00:06:02.819> can<00:06:02.849> see<00:06:02.999> I<00:06:03.509> have<00:06:03.779> a<00:06:03.809> little

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
the product you can see I have a little

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.529 
the product you can see I have a little
bit<00:06:04.229> more<00:06:04.529> of<00:06:04.710> lateral<00:06:05.129> instability<00:06:05.610> and

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
bit more of lateral instability and

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.480 
bit more of lateral instability and
that's<00:06:06.749> why<00:06:06.960> we<00:06:07.199> added<00:06:07.379> the<00:06:07.680> bolts<00:06:08.189> the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
that's why we added the bolts the

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.010 
that's why we added the bolts the
additional<00:06:08.909> bolts<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.360> connect<00:06:09.689> the<00:06:09.809> walls
