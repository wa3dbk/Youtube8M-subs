00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
on the French AP exam I did think it was

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.160 
on the French AP exam I did think it was
interesting<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> said<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> would

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
interesting that you said that you would
die<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> fight<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> recreate<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> Library<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
die and fight to recreate the Library of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
die and fight to recreate the Library of
Alexandria<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> way<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> great

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
Alexandria which by the way is a great

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.340 
Alexandria which by the way is a great
idea<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.610> only<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.090> could<00:00:42.270> die<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.870> fight<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
idea if only we could die or fight to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.779 
idea if only we could die or fight to
make<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> happen<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.610> point

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
make that happen I think your point

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.100 
make that happen I think your point
about<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> Library<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> Alexandria<00:00:45.629> though

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
about the Library of Alexandria though

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
about the Library of Alexandria though
is<00:00:46.260> exactly<00:00:46.860> why<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.489> useful<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.000> think

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
is exactly why it's useful to think

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
is exactly why it's useful to think
about<00:00:48.360> ultimate<00:00:48.840> concerns<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
about ultimate concerns it's because it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
about ultimate concerns it's because it
tells<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.750> value<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.680> would<00:00:52.949> die

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
tells you what you value you would die

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.410 
tells you what you value you would die
to<00:00:53.219> recreate<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> Library<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> Alexandria

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to recreate the Library of Alexandria

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
to recreate the Library of Alexandria
because<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.110> value<00:00:55.350> knowledge<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
because you value knowledge and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
because you value knowledge and
information<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> availability<00:00:57.570> of
