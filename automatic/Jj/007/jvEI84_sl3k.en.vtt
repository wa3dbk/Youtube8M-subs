00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
nice welds and I put all of our brackets

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.870 
nice welds and I put all of our brackets
back<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.010> we've<00:02:17.010> already<00:02:17.220> stretched<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
back on it we've already stretched the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000 
back on it we've already stretched the
back<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.630> frame<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:19.200> did<00:02:19.350> all<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
back of the frame we did all that the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.900 
back of the frame we did all that the
other<00:02:20.130> day<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.970> way<00:02:21.870> longer<00:02:22.140> wheelbase

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
other day that's a way longer wheelbase

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.280 
other day that's a way longer wheelbase
139<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> wheelbase<00:02:25.050> is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
139 I think it's what the wheelbase is

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.920 
139 I think it's what the wheelbase is
we're<00:02:26.010> gonna<00:02:26.100> set<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.580> 14<00:02:26.880> tire<00:02:27.150> kind<00:02:27.810> of
