00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.380
 the research vehicle f 600 is the predecessor of the FC Bologna and was 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.660
 already at the Tokyo Motor Show 2005 in the world 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.179
 The x 600 is still the current technology plaintiff for 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 Fuel cell technology at Mercedes Benz 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.859
 because the FCB 100 is a vehicle with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 this 2 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.569
 600 is a nonsense his vehicle 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.150
 powered solely by the electrical energy 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.540
 11 600 was built around the one to present the fuel cell around 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.850
 for clarification 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.540
 This vehicle looks like a normal vehicle and the hood 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.720
 but the technology is there 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.820
 the fuel cell system and one in three really feels already 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.230
 commanded is so went all floor 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.480
 Framework program there was no loss Walter Straumann is located 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.810
 in Mannheim 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.910
 1 600 liters of milk 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.360
 the power amounts to 82 hp via an electric motor the car 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.920
 available 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.390
 Not the full fuel cell power is needed 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.189
 stores a powerful lithium-ion battery 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.910
 the surplus 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.539
 at high energy demand 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.039
 the system switches the battery and the fuel cell together 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.039
 resulting in a total output of 115 hp 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.609
 the torque is 250 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.799
 or Dr 350 million 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.150
 The consumption of the research vehicle Skype should come at the equivalent of two 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.229
 nine liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.279
 what a range of 400 kilometers is enough 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.290
 despite the scarce 4 meters 30 long body, the space in the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.010
 Interior to exceed the dimensions of the automotive upper class 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.380
 The distance between the front and rear seats is almost one meter 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.229
 and can be moved up to 40 again, thanks to adjustable front seats 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.880
 Centimeters increase 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.649
 the fuel cell of the News 600 is about 40 percent smaller than 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.380
 so far 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.660
 should work 14 degrees and be characterized by a good cold start behavior 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:16.430
 Innovations such as the redesign of fuel cells should be used for this 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.019
 there is a Lectra SchÃ¶pp turbocharger 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.019
 and a new offer and dehumidification systems 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:27.049
 the BAV 600 is therefore a look into the future of benQ logical 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.079
 Drive technology and 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.179
 4 always important
