00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.690
 That problem with mine is that I am busy 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.340
 have sat on my eyebrow 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.970
 that's the trick here and they go 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.980
 so now 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.259
 love upstairs and then I have to love that 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.289
 be busy i also have one along with 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.480
 tears the eye that pressure 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.529
 coin specified with headache in it 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.330
 such a very refined 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.430
 it 's actually a bit of a family 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.460
 job as you get older then you can 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.199
 no eyebrows and that is possible 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.129
 ensure that the home of the 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.680
 eyelids 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.140
 for the eyelids hangs that you see 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.909
 here mali is that way with women 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.809
 eyebrows just above the eye socket edge 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.000
 white 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.830
 and the men on the eye socket land from the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.269
 has been able to close eyes 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.610
 I feel the eyebrow under the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.589
 eye socket edge is both here and there 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.290
 the eyebrow seat 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.440
 whole route bundle eye sockets edge and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.119
 who actually hears I would be there if you did 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.979
 put it a little higher than you see 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.570
 that something is still left now 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.640
 upper eyelids so there will also be one 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.740
 little bit from smartly deceased way 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.259
 yes maybe what i am instead of 50 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 but I think yes but yes I don't 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.030
 really that's why i really care about the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 pain and because I suffer from it once 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.380
 because of my work what you want to achieve 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.539
 at the surgery that you form from below 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.310
 the eyebrows up here that this is up 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.890
 being pulled 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 that is only possible if you do that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.210
 subcutaneous and where is it then 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 stuck to the other here 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.630
 here is a blunt ledge 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.369
 that bone rule is the transition from the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.289
 muscles you sit side 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.670
 close to it and that way 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.670
 for sitting are also attached to 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.800
 and I make it go backwards 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.280
 so 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.270
 and now I connect the one again 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.130
 side to the other side 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.740
 I have now detached this area to this 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.140
 detached with the scope you want this 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.640
 area where the nerves that wants you 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.540
 good image so that those nerves 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 do not get damaged 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.170
 look below is the bone and above 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.430
 is the bone membrane this is a bone membrane 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.640
 I have to loosen that bone now and here 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.640
 on the side 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.610
 in addition to the transition of muscle 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.740
 where is hard to see above is 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.740
 the muscle and there see the bone membrane 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.380
 well I loosen freeze until the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.480
 edge of the eye socket 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.190
 so we come from above, say above 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.500
 where I am now 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.350
 there is the eyebrow about than must 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.920
 I make sure that the bone membrane is broken here 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.090
 goes those skeins that are the nerves 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.520
 who care for feeling towards it 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.760
 mind so you should not break it 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.760
 to make 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.620
 the bone membrane that we have loosened 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.620
 we try real 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.950
 here we can go to the scalp more 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.510
 pull behind 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 so it is actually good with this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.910
 pull it back and there would soon 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.910
 also 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.590
 who now have the adhesion stuck to it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.660
 bone membrane made and which will come on soon 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.019
 connect the screw then you pull it 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.019
 backwards 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.610
 this kind of get me now that 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.030
 Layer what I detached it to this 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.480
 fixation and that is now on the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.480
 bottom layer 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.120
 was attached 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.890
 well i'm making a little farmer now you go 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.780
 there is the hole 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.530
 ok there goes a screw 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.130
 I screw there now to nail in and 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.509
 then you get seated now 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.030
 This is the thread attached to the peritoneum 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:31.300
 is stuck and it must be screwed 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:34.630
 you move forward but we bring the skin 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.970
 relaxation and I tie the bond 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.210
 You now see that the eyebrow is symmetrical 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.720
 higher and go as extra safety 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.979
 we 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.979
 gluing the cornea 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.949
 and now the final stitches and I get 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.599
 so much bandage around my head and 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.189
 Ready and next week I see go 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.189
 back to remove the stitches
