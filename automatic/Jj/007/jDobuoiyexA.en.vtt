00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.130
 Tell red farm guys when the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 executive bringing a playboy game today 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.690
 thing I just did a good boxing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
 game and failed carlos galvÃ£o 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 I recorded it after I finished college 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.259
 open and does not make sense anymore 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.349
 and we are here on the map in what are two is 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.400
 that's the hospital areas in 2025 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.249
 world sings in the yard 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.230
 damn the championship every case that was 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.010
 very short of a combat zone 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.720
 simple is a subway map shoots the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750
 there is not much strategy that does not 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 is knowing if positioning on the small map 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500
 This one is faster on the trigger of your 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.740
 adversary 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 for example now and I'm playing with 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.890
 imitate right 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.310
 this first weapon and this is my 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.590
 first class is personalized and now 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.760
 You have to evolve the weapon, you do not have it. 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.280
 much to do with the level of the player 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.810
 also this so I'll leave that will 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 take the maximum of prestige to train 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.940
 enough to even switch to another 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.250
 testing the suspected bomb that does not know 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.000
 I never went to play call of duty 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.040
 black ops it 's logical that no one knows is 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.659
 Brand new and I 've never been to much black play. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.370
 ops 2 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.680
 I did not play playoffs online 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.440
 I practically played Natalia an xbox fashion 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.120
 long ago and at the time divided 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.479
 the time the player is away then 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.820
 so I'm not very good at playing non 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.090
 I am experienced does not have those tactics 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.180
 of the political crisis does not use that tour 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 strange of who plays and such 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.229
 so I 'm a fucking bad truth 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.210
 is that I will pay the area but it does not stop me 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 to train good day and I'll go 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 learn from there with you is for those 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.930
 which also since he also do not play 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.360
 A lot of them are not eternal I'm going to die for 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 damn and can leave already scolding me day 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.020
 24 deaths rolled but that's how I said it 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.729
 I'm learning and let 's go there a lot 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.150
 difficult as it is very different from 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.610
 he is accustomed, right? 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.590
 one of the touch play styles called 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.050
 so normal that I go a little 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.810
 at first but cool than with videos 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:22.020
 You're going to see my improvement. 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:22.020
 Cock progressive right al 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.120
 Old bastard is a lot and a half you see 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.640
 that I'm crazy was not like strategy 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.010
 no bug, I'm not going to even 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.620
 I want to see war here, I want to have a dengue month. 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.709
 even if it is mine 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.510
 ai face fucking come to start talking 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.049
 The game is brand new, too. 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.980
 leg 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.870
 no, it's not my connection on the connection 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.690
 enough to play up to 8 megs here and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 I know it's not the latest connection 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.879
 very light and I'm not only complaining about everything 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.650
 world is playing at itamar 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.510
 the game changed a lot to lose to realize 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.980
 that changed a lot of the other games to 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.750
 that detran aa black ops aa 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.099
 game mechanics one of the graphics too 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.900
 beautiful carano not know assess whether 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.579
 I've liked the style of 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.629
 damn hill the sugary assistance 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.159

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:26.819
 she has a chance he runs damn her 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.819

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.209

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.170

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.989
 Face to face champion is good both 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.739
 playing a lot of fucking in the search losing 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.480
 but all and the map is not so well 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.580
 You buy the game, I do not know if this 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.290
 will last forever but comes with a 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.670
 redemption code you enter the store 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.920
 psn is a download about 400 megs and play 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:11.209
 on the map in the yard 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:13.049
 whoa human and dying in the area 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.120
 tight playing in the yard because 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.380
 I saw nobody play in the yard yet and this 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.120
 game mode do not have to be here it's just 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.049
 on the map there are several game modes 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.580
 now playing in the second round 1 to 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.110
 from here to those of domination 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.750
 and I played some of the game just to 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.310
 meet the basic controls and 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.750
 parks and digital base already gives to hold 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.780
 What the hell did I try out in Rio? 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.490
 tries to control him but he saw me 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.080
 damn face has too much black appeal 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.020
 still doing that split those 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 things in the champion and such 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.410
 the game is less prone to it 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.039
 type exist - positions for you camera 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.690
 eye of the I realized on the 70 champion map 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.180
 He has many ways for you to get there. 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:10.500
 at the same point then it becomes very difficult 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:12.690
 a championship guy to protect himself and 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:21.060
 loaded on the last one I think it was 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:23.310
 my myself but the crowd was quick 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.620
