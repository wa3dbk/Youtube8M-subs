00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
the 2013 versions except for the facial

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.540 
the 2013 versions except for the facial
expression<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.880> headpiece<00:02:21.270> obviously<00:02:21.900> is

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
expression the headpiece obviously is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.090 
expression the headpiece obviously is
different<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.290> does<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.950> other

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
different so does have all the other

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.160 
different so does have all the other
same<00:02:27.470> print<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.340> torso<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.390> leg<00:02:30.900> piece

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
same print on the torso and leg piece

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.770 
same print on the torso and leg piece
but<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.280> main<00:02:32.460> difference<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:32.880> for<00:02:33.120> 2014

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
but the main difference here for 2014

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.040 
but the main difference here for 2014
this<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.980> our<00:02:35.250> new<00:02:35.550> style<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.180> new<00:02:36.360> variant<00:02:36.900> on

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
this is our new style or new variant on

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.130 
this is our new style or new variant on
the<00:02:37.980> legs<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> torso<00:02:39.120> where<00:02:39.900> some<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the legs and the torso where some of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800 
the legs and the torso where some of
these<00:02:40.290> turtles<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.480> from<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
these turtles have and this is from the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.460 
these turtles have and this is from the
tee<00:02:43.020> rocket<00:02:43.530> 79<00:02:44.070> 120<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.660> set<00:02:45.870> number<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
tee rocket 79 120 is the set number that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.530 
tee rocket 79 120 is the set number that
this<00:02:46.680> Michelangelo<00:02:47.340> comes<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.420> can

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
this Michelangelo comes in and you can

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.690 
this Michelangelo comes in and you can
see<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> lot<00:02:48.900> different<00:02:49.500> detail<00:02:49.890> obviously<00:02:50.490> on

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
see a lot different detail obviously on

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.880 
see a lot different detail obviously on
the<00:02:51.209> torso<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.320> legs<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:54.140> also<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the torso and the legs and then also the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
the torso and the legs and then also the
facial<00:02:56.400> expression<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.940> different<00:02:57.270> as<00:02:57.330> well

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
facial expression is different as well

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.520 
facial expression is different as well
but<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.950> looks<00:02:59.370> very<00:02:59.970> similar<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
but it looks very similar to the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.550 
but it looks very similar to the
Shredder's<00:03:04.530> lair<00:03:06.260> Michelangelo<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.440> can

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
Shredder's lair Michelangelo but you can

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.650 
Shredder's lair Michelangelo but you can
see<00:03:07.740> there<00:03:07.950> there<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> slight<00:03:09.600> difference

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
see there there is a slight difference

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.090 
see there there is a slight difference
there<00:03:10.580> in<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.480> print<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.230> face<00:03:13.530> facial

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
there in the print on that face facial

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.830 
there in the print on that face facial
expression<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.390> know<00:03:15.480> when<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.660> first

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
expression so you know when you first

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.210 
expression so you know when you first
look<00:03:16.020> at<00:03:16.050> me<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.320> oh<00:03:16.440> that's<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.800> same<00:03:16.980> but

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
look at me like oh that's the same but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.040 
look at me like oh that's the same but
kind<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.820> look<00:03:17.970> at<00:03:18.120> them<00:03:18.239> from<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.780> angle

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
kind of look at them from this angle

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.470 
kind of look at them from this angle
yeah<00:03:19.489> where<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.700> angle<00:03:21.030> they<00:03:21.120> look<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.450> same

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
yeah where that angle they look the same

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.979 
yeah where that angle they look the same
but<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:23.310> once<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.700> go<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:24.060> angle<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
but then once you go this angle you

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.540 
but then once you go this angle you
realize<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.489> slightly<00:03:27.239> different<00:03:27.630> so

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
realize that it is slightly different so

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.880 
realize that it is slightly different so
those<00:03:29.550> are<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.450> four<00:03:30.709> Michelangelo's<00:03:31.709> from

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
those are the four Michelangelo's from

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.500 
those are the four Michelangelo's from
the<00:03:32.010> front<00:03:32.250> side<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:32.730> will<00:03:32.880> take<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> look<00:03:33.269> at

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
the front side we will take a look at

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.360 
the front side we will take a look at
the<00:03:33.750> back<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.230> looking<00:03:34.709> at<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.010> back<00:03:35.190> we're

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the back and looking at the back we're

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.340 
the back and looking at the back we're
going<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.550> be<00:03:35.640> doing<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.450> basically<00:03:36.720> from<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
going to be doing it basically from the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.340 
going to be doing it basically from the
same<00:03:37.560> one<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:39.180> cranes<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.140> lab

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
same one so this is the cranes at lab

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.130 
same one so this is the cranes at lab
escape<00:03:40.650> right<00:03:41.640> here<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.630> what<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> did<00:03:42.989> because

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
escape right here and what I did because

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
escape right here and what I did because
they<00:03:43.530> are<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.100> same<00:03:44.370> three<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.880> them<00:03:45.000> are<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
they are the same three of them are the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.530 
they are the same three of them are the
same<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:46.709> backs<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.340> that's<00:03:47.880> what<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.420> back

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
same the backs so that's what the back

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.170 
same the backs so that's what the back
of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.750> show<00:03:48.900> looks<00:03:49.170> like<00:03:49.820> that's<00:03:50.820> what<00:03:51.120> it

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
of the show looks like that's what it

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.970 
of the show looks like that's what it
looks<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.600> without<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.260> show<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.709> there

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
looks like without the show on there

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.400 
looks like without the show on there
obviously<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.700> then<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.420> shell<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.140> same

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
obviously and then the shell is the same

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.600 
obviously and then the shell is the same
the<00:03:55.620> back<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:58.320> backpack<00:03:58.769> shell<00:03:59.040> basically

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
the back the backpack shell basically

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.350 
the back the backpack shell basically
for<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:01.080> T<00:04:01.290> rocket<00:04:01.709> one<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.820> same<00:04:03.060> as<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
for the T rocket one is the same as the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.440 
for the T rocket one is the same as the
rest<00:04:03.570> but<00:04:04.170> obviously<00:04:04.709> he<00:04:04.950> has<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.489> different

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
rest but obviously he has a different

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.220 
rest but obviously he has a different
torso<00:04:07.110> print<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:08.239> there<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.810> one<00:04:10.049> last

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
