Hello its Kinoshita Yuka

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.515
Today I have, Old El Paso Mexican Food. They're Tacos . I feel like making tacos today. This is the taco shells

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:12.776
and I also bought some seasoning as well

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.364
I don't know why but I keep getting "please make Mexican food" on my twitter or the comment section from time to time. and well I kind of wanted to make them too and I do really enjoy Tacos as well

00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:33.255
OH and I really like Taco Rice as well should I make taco rice in the future? wait.... is taco rice mexican food? hmm well I don't know but today we will be making tacos

00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:44.590
we have on hand these: the taco shells, the sauce and the mix and the other needed ingredients are: tomatoes, lettuce, and ground beef (500g) also Cheese which I love!!

00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:47.171
please shred the lettuce into think strips

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.225
wash it and dry it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.929
dice up the tomatoes into about 2 cm pieces

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.985
put the ground beef into a pan and fry till it changes colors

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:25.386
discard the excess oil, its a nice trick to use a paper towel to absorb the grease

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.130
(she called it a "cooking sheet" and then corrected herself by calling it a "cooking paper")

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:35.603
and onto this we add the mix oh it smells "tacoey" waaa its a nice color

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.768
add 200cc of water

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:46.171
once it comes to a boil lower the heat and stir until the liquids evaporate

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:52.647
mmm its good but since I like sweet things I'm going to add a bit of sugar

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:58.458
with the lid off you let it go for about 15 to 20 minutes

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.351
warm the taco shells, they look like this out of the box

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:06.569
they smell like some sort of taco snacks, there's taco snacks out there isn't there... tacos? maybe not

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.433
oh they look tasty just like this and we will bake them

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:17.344
alright they've been baked they haven't changed color at all

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.992
most of the liquid has evaporated and I feel that instead of having "raw" cheese but placing it on here and letting it cook a bit would make it better

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.293
a lot went in!!!! maybe too much? cheese is so yummy

00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:38.423
it looks super delicious

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:42.592
tadaa its done it looks totally delish

00:02:50.827 --> 00:02:52.571
tadaa its all prepared

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.407
this apparently is the sauce

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.814
oh crap its so..... what? really?

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:21.806
I can't open it. what the... this is.... I'm so sad... gah. if only I had some friends or a boyfriend I could easily say please open this but since I am all alone

00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.396
perhaps using a rubber glove will help

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:30.842
it won't open

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.841
GOOGLE!!!! Google "can't open jar"

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:34.845
lol asking things like this lol

00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:40.658
I found it " ways to open hard to open jars "

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.385
uwa! oh SUGOI (wow) on the first try!!!!

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:56.940

00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:02.263

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:03.588
