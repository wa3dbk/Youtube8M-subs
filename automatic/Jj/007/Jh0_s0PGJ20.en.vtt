originally came to us with an idea to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
originally came to us with an idea to
develop<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.320> product<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.980> him<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
develop a product for him that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
develop a product for him that
originally<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.239> embodied<00:00:51.900> just<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> 20

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
originally was embodied just in a 20

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.819 
originally was embodied just in a 20
inch<00:00:53.579> ride<00:00:53.879> cymbal<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.170> he<00:00:55.320> wanted<00:00:55.710> out

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
inch ride cymbal and what he wanted out

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.229

of<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.219> cymbal<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> dark<00:00:57.570> tone<00:00:59.239> but

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of the right cymbal was a dark tone but

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
of the right cymbal was a dark tone but
he<00:01:00.420> wanted<00:01:00.750> some<00:01:01.320> wash<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.370> controlled

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
he wanted some wash but very controlled

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600 
he wanted some wash but very controlled
so<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.019> did<00:01:04.289> with<00:01:04.649> him<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.220> designed

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so what we did with him as we designed

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.290 
so what we did with him as we designed
assemble<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:08.149> 20<00:01:09.149> inch

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
assemble as you can see here 20 inch

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.620 
assemble as you can see here 20 inch
ride<00:01:09.619> we're<00:01:10.910> approximately<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:11.940> third<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
ride we're approximately a third of it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
ride we're approximately a third of it
is<00:01:13.050> not<00:01:13.410> laid<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.160> then<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> outer

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
is not laid and then the outer

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.499 
is not laid and then the outer
two-thirds<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.710> laid<00:01:17.160> and<00:01:18.149> that's<00:01:18.360> both

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
two-thirds of it is laid and that's both

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
two-thirds of it is laid and that's both
on<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> top<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.289> bottom<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.800> what<00:01:19.950> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
on the top of the bottom so what that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
on the top of the bottom so what that
allows<00:01:20.429> for<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.539> certain<00:01:22.350> amount<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.619> wash

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
allows for is a certain amount of wash

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.090 
allows for is a certain amount of wash
but<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.820> good<00:01:24.689> quick<00:01:25.140> decay<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
but then good quick decay of the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.120 
but then good quick decay of the
property<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.390> K<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> means<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
property it's a K so that means that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.740 
property it's a K so that means that
there's<00:01:29.369> additional<00:01:29.520> hammering<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.570> goes

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
there's additional hammering that goes

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
there's additional hammering that goes
into<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> product<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:31.979> find

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
into the product so what you would find

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
into the product so what you would find
in<00:01:32.400> some<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> our<00:01:32.820> other<00:01:32.880> products<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
in some of our other products in

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.069 
in some of our other products in
addition<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> sound<00:01:35.850> tends<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.899> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
addition to that the sound tends to be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
addition to that the sound tends to be
darker<00:01:37.829> than<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> may<00:01:38.430> find<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> nasal

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
darker than what you may find in a nasal

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
darker than what you may find in a nasal
gym<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> custom<00:01:40.979> product<00:01:41.399> so<00:01:42.119> this

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
gym or in a custom product so this

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
gym or in a custom product so this
originally<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> ride<00:01:43.500> cymbal<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.189> will

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
originally was the ride cymbal that will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:56.510 
originally was the ride cymbal that will

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 

so<00:01:57.520> we<00:01:57.640> introduced<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.180> product

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so we introduced this product

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.250 
so we introduced this product
specifically<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.220> only<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.120> Japan<00:02:01.690> with<00:02:02.050> one

one<00:02:02.710> SKU<00:02:03.120> we<00:02:04.120> introduced<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.810> about<00:02:05.560> 18<00:02:05.920> months

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
one SKU we introduced it about 18 months

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.520 
one SKU we introduced it about 18 months
ago<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:07.360> because<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.810> reception<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.980 
ago and because the reception of the
product<00:02:08.950> was<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.250> overwhelming<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.300> because

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
product was so overwhelming and because

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.420

there<00:02:11.170> was<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:11.350> buzz<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.680> started<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.310> be

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
there was a buzz that started to be

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.080 
there was a buzz that started to be
created<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> Internet<00:02:13.600> over<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.080> product

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.680 
we spoke with several of our other
artists<00:02:17.710> about<00:02:17.980> potentially<00:02:18.790> trying<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
artists about potentially trying the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.620

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
then we started to think about

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.540 
then we started to think about
potentially<00:02:26.650> how<00:02:26.800> we<00:02:26.860> might<00:02:27.130> be<00:02:27.310> able<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
potentially how we might be able to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.930 
potentially how we might be able to
expand<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.540> line<00:02:28.890> went<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> Kara<00:02:30.400> ask<00:02:30.730> them

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
expand the line went to a Kara ask them

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.030 
expand the line went to a Kara ask them
about<00:02:31.060> potentially<00:02:31.990> developing<00:02:32.620> some

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
about potentially developing some

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.190 
about potentially developing some
additional<00:02:33.730> products<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> right<00:02:34.720> cymbal

additional products to the right cymbal

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.740 
additional products to the right cymbal

and then in January of this year we

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.980 
and then in January of this year we
launched<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.770> full<00:02:39.190> array<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.090> product<00:02:40.810> that
