defeating<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> bees<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> pretty

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
defeating the bees and this is a pretty

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
defeating the bees and this is a pretty
hard<00:01:32.939> level<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.299> gotta<00:01:33.509> say<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> should<00:01:34.710> stop

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
hard level I gotta say so I should stop

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
hard level I gotta say so I should stop
selecting<00:01:35.400> all<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> them<00:01:35.909> oh<00:01:36.119> man<00:01:36.479> alright

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
selecting all of them oh man alright

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240 
selecting all of them oh man alright
let's<00:01:37.200> try

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
let's try

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
let's try
so<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.540> got<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> spread<00:01:39.930> them

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so as you can see you got to spread them

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
so as you can see you got to spread them
out<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.590> once<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> bees<00:01:41.670> come<00:01:41.909> as

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
out one once a lot of the bees come as

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
out one once a lot of the bees come as
you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.810> chaos<00:01:43.170> right<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.409> I'm

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you can see it's as chaos right now I'm

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.460 
you can see it's as chaos right now I'm
not<00:01:44.369> usually<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:44.970> bad<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.540> while

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
not usually not this bad but while

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.080 
not usually not this bad but while
talking<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> keeping<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> phone<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
talking it keeping the phone and the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.660 
talking it keeping the phone and the
camera<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> angle<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.670> actually

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
camera at this angle and actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.609 
camera at this angle and actually
playing<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> kind<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.479> difficult<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.500> let's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
playing it is kind of difficult so let's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.630 
playing it is kind of difficult so let's
go<00:01:52.710> ahead<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.890> try<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.399> more<00:01:53.490> time

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
go ahead and try that one more time

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.179 
go ahead and try that one more time
let's<00:01:54.360> begin<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.869> hopefully<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.920> lasts<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
let's begin this hopefully it lasts a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.980 
let's begin this hopefully it lasts a
little<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.549> longer<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:57.270> last<00:01:57.450> time

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
little bit longer than last time

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
little bit longer than last time
so<00:01:58.500> let<00:01:58.619> me<00:01:58.649> select<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.340> half<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.149> about

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so let me select a half of these about

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.620 
so let me select a half of these about
and<00:02:00.860> attack<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:03.090> we'll<00:02:03.270> keep<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> other

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and attack that and we'll keep the other

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.660 
and attack that and we'll keep the other
half<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> protect<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> shoe<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
half just to protect the shoe and the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
half just to protect the shoe and the
shoes<00:02:05.939> basically<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.630> Haven<00:02:07.170> home<00:02:07.560> Haven

I haven't defeated story mode yet but

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.210 
I haven't defeated story mode yet but
let's<00:02:53.780> try<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.170> one<00:02:54.350> that's<00:02:54.620> free<00:02:54.830> mode<00:02:55.010> one

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
let's try that one that's free mode one

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.840 
let's try that one that's free mode one
more<00:02:55.370> time

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
more time

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.100 
more time
and<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.840> tried<00:02:57.200> easier<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:57.740> let's<00:02:57.950> try<00:02:58.100> um

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
and I tried easier one let's try um

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.690 
and I tried easier one let's try um
number<00:03:00.110> two<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.680> should<00:03:00.890> be<00:03:01.160> able<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.370> feed<00:03:01.580> that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
number two I should be able to feed that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.910 
number two I should be able to feed that
one<00:03:01.910> hopefully<00:03:02.360> unless<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.810> I'm<00:03:03.260> not<00:03:03.560> feeling

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
one hopefully unless I I'm not feeling

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.250 
one hopefully unless I I'm not feeling
it<00:03:03.950> today<00:03:04.360> all<00:03:05.360> right<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.900> can<00:03:05.960> see<00:03:06.020> the
