I'm going to go over that in a video
what<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.690> already<00:02:35.230> wake<00:02:35.700> whoa<00:02:37.709> was

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
what the it's already wake whoa was

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.780 
what the it's already wake whoa was
that<00:02:39.069> all<00:02:39.220> about

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
that all about

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.000 
that all about
must<00:02:40.420> be<00:02:40.540> like<00:02:40.690> fastboot<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:41.709> us<00:02:41.799> like<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
must be like fastboot you have us like a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.039 
must be like fastboot you have us like a
super<00:02:42.400> boost<00:02:42.640> mode<00:02:42.910> here<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> think<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
super boost mode here and but I think it

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.610 
super boost mode here and but I think it
draws<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.830> battery<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.000> background

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
draws like battery in the background

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.250 
draws like battery in the background
that<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:48.700> fast<00:02:49.090> Wow<00:02:52.019> please<00:02:53.019> turn

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that was fast Wow please turn

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.289 
that was fast Wow please turn
offs<00:02:53.470> fast-food<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.340> see<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.790> difference<00:02:55.150> I

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
offs fast-food to see the difference I

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.840 
offs fast-food to see the difference I
mean<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.930> must<00:02:56.019> draw<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.100> battery<00:02:57.459> or

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
mean it must draw but like battery or

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.130 
mean it must draw but like battery or
something<00:02:58.330> in<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.480> background<00:02:58.569> whereas

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
something in the background whereas

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:12.770 
something in the background whereas
everyone<00:02:59.440> probably<00:02:59.799> with<00:03:00.040> it

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.290 

so<00:03:13.350> both<00:03:13.590> are<00:03:13.860> very<00:03:14.100> quick<00:03:14.610> here<00:03:14.790> putting<00:03:15.030> down

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
so both are very quick here putting down

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:27.290 
so both are very quick here putting down
just<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.350> nice<00:03:16.620> little<00:03:16.650> thing

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.550 

but<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.420> kind<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.660> feels<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.110> somebody's

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
but it kind of feels like somebody's

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.920 
but it kind of feels like somebody's
going<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.770> win<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.040> one

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.009

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
they remember there is almost a year or

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.670 
they remember there is almost a year or
half<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.450> year<00:03:47.480> at<00:03:47.750> least<00:03:47.810> difference<00:03:48.349> between

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
half a year at least difference between

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.470 
half a year at least difference between
these<00:03:48.860> two<00:03:49.040> devices<00:03:49.099> when<00:03:49.610> they<00:03:49.700> came<00:03:49.879> out<00:03:50.120> on

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
these two devices when they came out on

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.990 
these two devices when they came out on
the<00:03:50.599> market<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:52.280> one<00:03:52.489> still<00:03:52.670> performs

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
the market and this one still performs

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.229 
the market and this one still performs
amazing<00:03:53.420> but<00:03:53.629> it<00:03:54.379> just<00:03:54.470> feels<00:03:54.650> clunky<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.609> I

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
amazing but it just feels clunky and I

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.940 
amazing but it just feels clunky and I
don't<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:56.659> to<00:03:56.810> design<00:03:57.079> at<00:03:57.260> all<00:03:57.439> it<00:03:57.680> doesn't

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
don't like to design at all it doesn't

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.500 
don't like to design at all it doesn't

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.729 
could have been one of the best phones
if<00:04:06.439> they<00:04:06.620> put<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.220> up<00:04:07.579> up<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.879> design

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
if they put it up up the design

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.740 
if they put it up up the design
this<00:04:09.739> phone<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.280> other<00:04:10.310> hand<00:04:10.879> is<00:04:11.269> pretty

interesting actually it is having a very

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.599 
interesting actually it is having a very
great<00:04:15.170> design<00:04:15.500> perfect<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.250> those<00:04:16.310> people

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
great design perfect for those people

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.640 
great design perfect for those people
that<00:04:16.669> want<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:16.970> have<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.299> small<00:04:17.660> phone<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.169> don't

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
that want to have a small phone I don't

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.860 
that want to have a small phone I don't
know<00:04:18.889> though<00:04:19.310> why<00:04:19.549> they<00:04:19.760> didn't<00:04:20.389> remove<00:04:20.600> this

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
know though why they didn't remove this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.230 
know though why they didn't remove this
area<00:04:21.590> just<00:04:22.250> feels<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.669> they<00:04:22.850> could<00:04:22.970> remove

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
area just feels like they could remove

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.029 
area just feels like they could remove
that<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:24.729> space<00:04:25.729> up<00:04:26.000> here<00:04:26.030> also<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.860> made

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
that and space up here also and it made

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.210 
that and space up here also and it made
it<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.430> little<00:04:28.639> bit<00:04:28.849> thinner<00:04:29.090> on<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.780> sides

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
it a little bit thinner on the sides

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.219 
it a little bit thinner on the sides
because<00:04:31.220> it's<00:04:31.430> pretty<00:04:31.580> thick<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.240> maybe<00:04:32.870> I

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
because it's pretty thick but maybe I

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.170 
because it's pretty thick but maybe I
think<00:04:33.770> there's<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.070> many<00:04:34.130> kind<00:04:34.490> of<00:04:34.550> enjoy

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
think there's so many kind of enjoy

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.999 
think there's so many kind of enjoy
start<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.720> something<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.470> in<00:04:36.560> terms<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.889> the

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
start to something and in terms of the

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.000 
start to something and in terms of the
design<00:04:37.250> seem<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.789> be<00:04:37.880> enjoying<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.419> ton<00:04:39.010> so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
design seem to be enjoying it a ton so

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.740 
design seem to be enjoying it a ton so
yeah<00:04:40.130> with<00:04:40.550> your<00:04:40.729> video<00:04:40.970> game<00:04:41.180> hopefully<00:04:41.570> you
