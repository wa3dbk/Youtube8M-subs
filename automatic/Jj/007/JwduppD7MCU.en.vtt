00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.389
 c4 a smartphone with a more display 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.179
 great because we have a 55 inch of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 diagonal is not waterproof but one 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 peculiar characteristic that is the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.090
 5 megapixel front camera with a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 powerful flash also to do 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
 selphy in the dark behind the room instead 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 13 megapixels with of course always the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 flash is not waterproof we have here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.850
 on the left the jack for the micro usb 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.940
 above the headphones and in this part nor i 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 we have the nano sim and the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.879
 micro usb 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 always remains the iconic button for 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.030
 turn on charges the terminal is the como 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.510
 of on the button to activate quickly 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.440
 the camera maybe we try to do 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.969
 a photo with the front room you see 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 here the flash is active tac snaps and also 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.590
 in particular lighting conditions 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.809
 as now he is taking pictures that are not 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.519
 of Angola as you review and ample excuse 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 the face 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.450
 photography as really captures 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.820
 lots of space 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.950
 the software is the classic of sony 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 the interface is now known 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.490
 and run-in the processor is a mediatek 64 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 67 52 then a 64-bit work 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.790
 really guarantees speed 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.650
 interesting you see lollipop then 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.860
 android 5.0 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.580
 the full hd display and an ips is me 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.900
 seemed very nice in the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.800
 and in the first pressure I had here 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.230
 in the first contact beat from 2600 thousand 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.630
 emilia for now for a product that 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.210
 seems really interesting to those who love 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 the phones with displays a little bit wide 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.920
