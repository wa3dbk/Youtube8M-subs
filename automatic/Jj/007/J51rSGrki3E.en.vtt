cool<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.759> go<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.299> kick<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
cool is you can just go up and kick it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.510 
cool is you can just go up and kick it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and it'll go flying like in a certain

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
and it'll go flying like in a certain
direction<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.570> also<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.840> pull<00:01:22.020> out

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like golf club or something like that as

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.800 
like golf club or something like that as
you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.240> friend<00:01:24.509> literally<00:01:24.720> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you can see my friend literally just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
you can see my friend literally just
went<00:01:24.960> flying<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.070> container<00:01:26.400> after

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
went flying up with that container after

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
went flying up with that container after
he<00:01:26.759> hit<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> golf<00:01:27.240> club<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> can't

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
he hit with a golf club but you can't

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
he hit with a golf club but you can't
hit<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> make<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:28.920> flying<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.700> best

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
hit it and make you go flying the best

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
hit it and make you go flying the best
part<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.659> though<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
part for this though is if you have a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
part for this though is if you have a
flare<00:01:32.189> gun<00:01:32.220> I'd<00:01:32.520> suggest<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.090> some<00:01:33.270> flare

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
flare gun I'd suggest you get some flare

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
flare gun I'd suggest you get some flare
ammo<00:01:33.990> before<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:34.860> into<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.430> go

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
ammo before you get into this just go

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.670 
ammo before you get into this just go
into<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> these<00:01:36.479> containers<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.200> shoot

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
into one of these containers and shoot

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.469 
into one of these containers and shoot
your<00:01:37.829> flare<00:01:38.189> gun<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.579> into<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> you'll

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
your flare gun up into it and you'll

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.420 
your flare gun up into it and you'll
notice<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.140> flying<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.799> didn't<00:01:41.340> go

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
notice that you go flying I didn't go

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.370 
notice that you go flying I didn't go
very<00:01:41.549> high<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:42.150> you've<00:01:42.360> actually<00:01:42.570> got

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
very high this time you've actually got

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
very high this time you've actually got
the<00:01:43.470> ability<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.920> higher<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> go

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the ability to go higher but you can go

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
the ability to go higher but you can go
super<00:01:45.960> high<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
super high with this and all you have to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
super high with this and all you have to
do<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> shoot<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.210> flare<00:01:48.450> gun<00:01:48.630> straight<00:01:48.899> up

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
do is shoot that flare gun straight up

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
do is shoot that flare gun straight up
at<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.820> works<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.600> are

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
at it and it also works if you like are

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.090 
at it and it also works if you like are
on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> outside<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> shoot<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> flare<00:01:53.070> gun

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
on the outside and shoot the flare gun

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.530 
on the outside and shoot the flare gun
add<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.670> outside<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.390> go

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
add it on the outside it's gonna go

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.940 
add it on the outside it's gonna go
flying<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> certain<00:01:55.290> direction<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> can

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
flying in a certain direction as you can

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
flying in a certain direction as you can
see<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:57.299> anyways<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.750> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
see right here but anyways I think that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.330 
see right here but anyways I think that
this<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> probably<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> best<00:01:59.040> mono

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this is probably one of the best mono

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.800 
this is probably one of the best mono
missions<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.820> we've<00:01:59.909> seen<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.299> while<00:02:00.329> on

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
missions that we've seen in a while on

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
missions that we've seen in a while on
consoles<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.890> most<00:02:02.070> people<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.399> been

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
consoles because most people have been

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
consoles because most people have been
focusing<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.060> PC<00:02:03.450> mods<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.469> really

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
focusing on PC mods so you really

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.139 
focusing on PC mods so you really
haven't<00:02:04.860> been<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.520> because

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
haven't been that much out because

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.580 
haven't been that much out because
Rockstar<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.630> kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> cracking<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.290> on

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
Rockstar is kind of cracking down on

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.050 
Rockstar is kind of cracking down on
that<00:02:07.680> as

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
