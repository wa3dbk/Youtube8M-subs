00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 for all of you a report that does not 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.040
 he never won it because it's a subject that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.660
 worries all women and is the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 know what we do with our fingernails ok 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.699
 I have to tell you how I told them 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.949
 a little while technical things to paint us 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 the nails ok for this will need 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.070
 some materials but they are all 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.609
 material of twist art to which we have 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.430
 there within reach that there is not going there for the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130
 first taught nail we're going to do 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.340
 we need this all school broom 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.950
 know that these are smooth sheet that when 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 your sheet is broken you have to put it 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 to the folder to hook him good 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 You hit a caress, it's stuff when the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.870
 we are going to use to make a design 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.490
 nails and we started good the first thing that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.830
 we are going to do is going to be painting our 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.680
 nails of some color very clear as per 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.240
 example this green that I chose we are going to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.830
 grab these smooth sheet that I told them 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.830
 a little while ago and we're going to hit it 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.790
 Y 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.439
 let's choose a dark color that 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.600
 combine with this green and we will apply 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.600
 I choose a black for example 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.650
 and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.909
 is what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.500
 the yellows that we hit at the beginning and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.140
 that's how our nails are now, let's go 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.670
 to give up a hand shine that this 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.090
 makes everything better for life in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 general because that's how they look, I made myself 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.140
 whole hand but because I love this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.670
 proposed design before a single unit is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.860
 more paint fabrics in black or color 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.869
 Skin milestone and obvious you can do it with 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.240
 the colors that you want now another 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.569
 proposal to paint the nails red 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.890
 and a single black one to get these 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.289
 invisible that are what you are 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.470
 put in your hair and let's make some 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.600
 dots on the red nails in black and 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.600
 about the union 'great in red let's go 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.609
 victory red and black the rising 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.150
 proposal will need a point of 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.150
 Silvio 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.750
 but in those kitchen sponges that already 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.190
 we do not use anymore because she is already old with 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.230
 they will recycle it to be examined in the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.970
 typical the typical of washing dishes good 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.830
 now they will use it for graffiti on the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 nails are going to paint the nails with some 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.910
 light color in this case I chose the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.800
 white let's use our 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.930
 sponge and in this case I use 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:15.850
 all pastel colors well clarito 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:17.410
 feel the sponge ok kim is 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.300
 braking but this will not be like that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.040
 now they 're going to grab an unusual one and they're going 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.540
 to load in nail polish remover and we will 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.540
 withdraw all the surplus 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.510
 a good garden and the latest proposal 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.660
 What I have to offer are some nails 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.300
 they are called spatial nails only 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.370
 they will need a white base a color 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.819
 blue or violet type some brightness 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.470
 and a shot above the white base 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.590
 let's put a color like for example 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.030
 electric blue once these signs 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.620
 are dry what we are going to do is 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:05.569
 load a swab with a little 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.930
 nail polish remover once we have it 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:13.360
 easy let's grab some of these 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.360
 shines and we're going to put it over 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 finally with the white base we are going to 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.130
 add a few white dots once 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.910
 we have them so we add our 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.860
