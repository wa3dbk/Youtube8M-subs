00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
just one solid map because now we've

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.289 
just one solid map because now we've
been<00:00:13.650> able<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.130> experience<00:00:14.519> both<00:00:14.820> we've<00:00:15.089> had

full weekend where we playing every

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.460 
full weekend where we playing every
single<00:00:17.250> map<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.880> child<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.690> we've<00:00:19.020> also<00:00:19.199> had<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
single map in child and we've also had a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.019 
single map in child and we've also had a
weekend<00:00:19.859> where<00:00:20.010> we've<00:00:20.160> gone<00:00:20.279> back<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.850> just

having that one Mac now last week we all
know<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:24.930> were<00:00:24.990> rotating<00:00:25.740> they

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
know that they were rotating they

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
know that they were rotating they
rotated<00:00:26.279> between<00:00:26.430> every<00:00:27.000> single<00:00:27.300> child

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
rotated between every single child

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
rotated between every single child
Osiris<00:00:28.080> map<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.099> ever<00:00:29.340> been<00:00:29.640> able

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
Osiris map that we have ever been able

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.900 
Osiris map that we have ever been able
to<00:00:30.090> play<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.949> bungee<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.489> gone<00:00:32.700> back

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to play and now a bungee have gone back

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.139 
to play and now a bungee have gone back
to<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.329> having<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:34.079> map<00:00:34.440> per<00:00:35.040> week<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.790> last

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to just having one map per week so last

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.729 
to just having one map per week so last
week<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.600> an<00:00:36.809> experiment<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:37.500> said

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
week it was an experiment they said

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
week it was an experiment they said
specifically<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> they're<00:00:39.210> gonna<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.570> how

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
specifically that they're gonna see how

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.540 
specifically that they're gonna see how
the<00:00:39.780> community<00:00:40.020> reacts<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> then

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the community reacts to it and then

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.709 
the community reacts to it and then
they're<00:00:41.700> gonna<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
they're gonna see if they can make it a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.790 
they're gonna see if they can make it a
permanent<00:00:42.899> thing<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
permanent thing but it's just going to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190 
permanent thing but it's just going to
be<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> one-off<00:00:44.460> rotation<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.780> gonna<00:00:45.989> keep

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
be a one-off rotation not gonna keep

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
be a one-off rotation not gonna keep
happening<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.370> knew<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.270> just

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
happening we all knew that but I just

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
happening we all knew that but I just
wanted<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.440> video<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.160> find<00:00:50.489> out

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
wanted to make this video to find out

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
wanted to make this video to find out
what<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.690> reaction<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.370> rotation

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
what your reaction was to this rotation

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.500 
what your reaction was to this rotation
because<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.710> assume<00:00:55.710> i<00:00:56.129> might<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.879> wrong<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.449> i

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
because I assume i might be wrong but i

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
because I assume i might be wrong but i
assume<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> reaction<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.129> not

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
assume that with the reaction was not

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.369 
assume that with the reaction was not
super<00:00:59.879> super<00:01:00.149> crazy<00:01:00.449> positive<00:01:01.170> like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
super super crazy positive like

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
super super crazy positive like
overwhelmingly<00:01:02.219> positive<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:03.449> i<00:01:03.539> feel

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
overwhelmingly positive because i feel

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
overwhelmingly positive because i feel
like<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.320> overwhelmingly<00:01:05.100> positive

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
like if it was overwhelmingly positive

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
like if it was overwhelmingly positive
to<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> rotation<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.869> trials<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.799> they

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to have a rotation for trials then they

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800 
to have a rotation for trials then they
would<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.310> kept<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> rotation<00:01:09.570> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
would have just kept the rotation in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
would have just kept the rotation in
even<00:01:10.530> though<00:01:10.650> last<00:01:10.920> week<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> did<00:01:11.430> say<00:01:11.610> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
even though last week they did say that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.330 
even though last week they did say that
it<00:01:11.820> would<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.689> returning<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:14.010> map

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it would be returning to just one map

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
it would be returning to just one map
but<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> feel<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.030> everyone<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.509> oh

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
but I feel like if everyone was like oh

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.880 
but I feel like if everyone was like oh
my<00:01:15.659> god<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.049> most<00:01:16.350> amazing<00:01:16.619> thing<00:01:16.770> ever

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
then they would have just kept it rather

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.160 
then they would have just kept it rather
than<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.100> back<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.790> map<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> week<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.049> my

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
than going back to one map a week so my

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
than going back to one map a week so my
question<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.799> guys<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> prefer

question that you guys is do you prefer
having<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> maps<00:01:25.140> rotating<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:27.180> every

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
having the maps rotating as in every

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
having the maps rotating as in every
week<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> play<00:01:28.560> every<00:01:29.009> single<00:01:29.340> map

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
week you get to play every single map

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.999 
week you get to play every single map
that<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.880> played<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.270> travel<00:01:30.689> sires<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.560> do

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that is played for travel sires or do

you<00:01:32.070> prefer<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.150> map<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you prefer to have one map for the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.030 
you prefer to have one map for the
entire<00:01:34.759> weekend<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> torn<00:01:37.829> on

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
entire weekend so I'm kind of torn on

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
entire weekend so I'm kind of torn on
the<00:01:38.189> subject<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.820> perfectly<00:01:39.210> honest<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the subject to be perfectly honest that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
the subject to be perfectly honest that
when<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.320> maps<00:01:40.560> were<00:01:40.740> rotating<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.970> oh

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
when the maps were rotating as like oh

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
when the maps were rotating as like oh
this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.659> awesome<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.470> switches<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this is so awesome it like switches it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.319 
this is so awesome it like switches it
up<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.759> different<00:01:45.149> guns

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
up you get to use different guns

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.719 
up you get to use different guns
different<00:01:45.780> strategies<00:01:46.290> teams<00:01:47.009> can't<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.610> do

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
different strategies teams can't just do

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
different strategies teams can't just do
the<00:01:47.939> same<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.420> every<00:01:48.810> single<00:01:49.020> game<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> be

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the same thing every single game and be

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.700 
the same thing every single game and be
successful<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.020> played

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
successful with it but as I played

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
successful with it but as I played
burning<00:01:53.280> shrine<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.820> week<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.329> was<00:01:54.450> just

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
burning shrine this week and it was just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.069 
burning shrine this week and it was just
one<00:01:54.899> map<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> entire<00:01:55.470> time<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.509> kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.810> grew

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
one map the entire time I kind of grew

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.859 
one map the entire time I kind of grew
to<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.460> having<00:01:59.790> one<00:02:00.210> map<00:02:00.630> now

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to really like just having one map now

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
to really like just having one map now
of<00:02:00.990> course<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> burning<00:02:01.920> shrine<00:02:02.159> which<00:02:02.490> in

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
of course it is burning shrine which in

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
of course it is burning shrine which in
my<00:02:02.909> opinion<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.960> best<00:02:03.990> trials<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> Osiris

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
my opinion is the best trials of Osiris

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
my opinion is the best trials of Osiris
map<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> might<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.299> why<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.750> just

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
map so that might be why I'm just

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.619 
map so that might be why I'm just
enjoying<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.469> one<00:02:07.680> map<00:02:07.950> thing<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.239> kind<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
enjoying the one map thing but I kind of

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.260 
enjoying the one map thing but I kind of
felt<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:10.979> rotating<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.849> got

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
felt like when it was rotating I got

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.080 
felt like when it was rotating I got
black<00:02:12.540> shield

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
black shield

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.360 
black shield
four<00:02:13.390> times<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.080> row<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.769> during<00:02:15.190> one<00:02:15.340> of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
four times in a row what during one of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.990 
four times in a row what during one of
my<00:02:15.550> run<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.060> black<00:02:16.690> shield<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.739> think<00:02:18.580> it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
my run and black shield is I think it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.240 
my run and black shield is I think it
might<00:02:19.269> be<00:02:19.330> my<00:02:19.780> least<00:02:20.170> favorite<00:02:20.739> map<00:02:20.950> it's

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
might be my least favorite map it's

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.949 
might be my least favorite map it's
definitely<00:02:21.730> one<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.150> don't<00:02:22.390> seem<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.810> do

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
definitely one that I don't seem to do

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.140 
definitely one that I don't seem to do
as<00:02:23.140> well<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:24.040> don't<00:02:24.250> know<00:02:24.370> what<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.879> I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
as well on I don't know what it is I

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.059 
as well on I don't know what it is I
don't<00:02:25.629> like<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.930> doors<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:26.830> find<00:02:27.010> it

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
don't like the doors I just find it

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.710 
don't like the doors I just find it
really<00:02:27.220> awkward<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.879> gameplays<00:02:28.269> awkward

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
really awkward the gameplays awkward

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.660 
really awkward the gameplays awkward
there's<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.959> lot<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.140> places<00:02:29.440> outside<00:02:29.860> near

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
there's a lot of places outside near

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.280 
there's a lot of places outside near
where<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.269> flag<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.810> black<00:02:32.019> shield

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
where the be flag is on black shield

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.380 
where the be flag is on black shield
where<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:32.980> really<00:02:33.610> easy<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:33.970> head<00:02:34.209> glitch

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
where it's really easy to head glitch

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.930 
where it's really easy to head glitch
and<00:02:34.599> it's<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.140> annoying<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.950> play<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.549> my

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
and it's just annoying to play in my

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.910 
and it's just annoying to play in my
opinion<00:02:37.239> black<00:02:37.750> shields<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.319> an<00:02:38.470> annoying

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
opinion black shields just an annoying

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.420 
opinion black shields just an annoying
map<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> was<00:02:40.750> thinking<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.410> maybe<00:02:41.590> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
map so I was thinking that maybe the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.150 
map so I was thinking that maybe the
reason<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.299> have<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:43.959> map<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.950> have

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
reason to have just one map and have

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.059 
reason to have just one map and have
this<00:02:45.340> consistency<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.650> make<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.860> to

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
this consistency is so if you make it to

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.610 
this consistency is so if you make it to
the<00:02:48.190> lighthouse<00:02:48.400> you've<00:02:49.360> gone<00:02:50.200> through<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
the lighthouse you've gone through the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.440 
the lighthouse you've gone through the
same<00:02:50.650> stuff<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.280> everybody<00:02:51.760> else<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.209> played

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
same stuff as everybody else you played

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.199 
same stuff as everybody else you played
the<00:02:52.630> same<00:02:52.840> map<00:02:53.170> you've<00:02:53.620> played<00:02:53.920> 3v3<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.970> team

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
the same map you've played 3v3 your team

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.670 
the same map you've played 3v3 your team
against<00:02:55.630> their<00:02:55.780> team<00:02:55.989> if<00:02:56.140> you've<00:02:56.290> made<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
against their team if you've made it to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.289 
against their team if you've made it to
the<00:02:56.769> lighthouse<00:02:56.950> than<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.610> you've<00:02:58.060> heard

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
the lighthouse than you you've heard

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.690 
the lighthouse than you you've heard
that<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.140> obviously<00:02:59.530> have<00:03:00.099> now<00:03:00.579> of

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
that you you obviously have now of

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.100 
that you you obviously have now of
course<00:03:00.879> when<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.180> maps<00:03:01.420> are<00:03:01.569> rotating<00:03:01.989> you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
course when the maps are rotating you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.690 
course when the maps are rotating you
still<00:03:02.379> earned<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.920> course<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.549> you

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
still earned it of course like you

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.089 
still earned it of course like you
definitely<00:03:04.390> did<00:03:04.599> but<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.560> one<00:03:05.829> team

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
definitely did but if you have one team

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.880 
definitely did but if you have one team
for<00:03:06.370> example<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.970> had<00:03:07.180> burning<00:03:08.079> shrine<00:03:08.379> four

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
for example the had burning shrine four

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.800 
for example the had burning shrine four
times<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.489> row<00:03:09.640> during<00:03:09.910> their<00:03:10.120> passage<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
times in a row during their passage and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.330 
times in a row during their passage and
then<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.049> had<00:03:11.200> one<00:03:11.470> team<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.890> had<00:03:12.010> black

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
then you had one team that had black

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.830 
then you had one team that had black
shield<00:03:12.610> four<00:03:12.879> times<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.329> row<00:03:13.420> then<00:03:13.599> they<00:03:13.690> had

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
shield four times in a row then they had

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.240 
shield four times in a row then they had
widows<00:03:14.140> court<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.650> they<00:03:14.709> weren't<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.010> great

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
widows court and they weren't that great

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.479 
widows court and they weren't that great
at<00:03:15.459> sniping<00:03:15.750> etc<00:03:16.750> etc<00:03:16.859> then<00:03:17.859> maybe<00:03:18.250> that

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
at sniping etc etc then maybe that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.670 
at sniping etc etc then maybe that
people<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.150> team<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.959> made<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
people that team that made it to the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.379 
people that team that made it to the
lighthouse<00:03:20.889> they<00:03:21.760> could<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.060> got<00:03:22.209> there

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
lighthouse they could have got there

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.059 
lighthouse they could have got there
just<00:03:22.540> because<00:03:22.720> they<00:03:23.019> got<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.440> better<00:03:23.650> maps

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
just because they got the better maps

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.190 
just because they got the better maps
and<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:24.970> team<00:03:25.269> got<00:03:25.630> maps<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.079> they

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
and then this team got maps that they

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.930 
and then this team got maps that they
necessarily<00:03:26.350> didn't<00:03:27.069> play<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.340> well<00:03:27.579> on

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
necessarily didn't play that well on

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.849 
necessarily didn't play that well on
that's<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.450> dog<00:03:28.630> barking<00:03:29.139> let's<00:03:29.349> ignore<00:03:29.680> it

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
that's a dog barking let's ignore it

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.280 
that's a dog barking let's ignore it
happens<00:03:30.280> every<00:03:30.579> day<00:03:30.609> or<00:03:31.480> they<00:03:31.660> just<00:03:31.690> got<00:03:31.989> maps

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
happens every day or they just got maps

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.050 
happens every day or they just got maps
that<00:03:32.620> weren't<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.160> good<00:03:33.340> like<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:33.819> my

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
that weren't that good like in my

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.960 
that weren't that good like in my
opinion<00:03:34.359> blackshield<00:03:35.049> etc<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.280> i<00:03:36.310> think<00:03:36.549> i

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
opinion blackshield etc so i think i

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.599 
opinion blackshield etc so i think i
like<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.540> consistency<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:38.620> think<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.280> I

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
like the consistency I think I like it I

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.039 
like the consistency I think I like it I
mean<00:03:39.760> I've<00:03:39.940> made<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.420> lighthouse<00:03:40.599> with

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
mean I've made it to the lighthouse with

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.050 
mean I've made it to the lighthouse with
rotating<00:03:41.500> not<00:03:41.829> rotating<00:03:42.340> every<00:03:42.579> single<00:03:42.940> map

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
rotating not rotating every single map

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.110 
rotating not rotating every single map
every<00:03:43.359> single<00:03:43.630> week<00:03:43.780> but<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.859> yeah<00:03:45.639> I

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
every single week but I just yeah I

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.990 
every single week but I just yeah I
think<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.200> think<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.709> like<00:03:47.919> it<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.310> rotating<00:03:48.910> I

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
think I think I like it not rotating I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.520 
think I think I like it not rotating I
think<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.329> i<00:03:49.359> like<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.019> being<00:03:50.349> this

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
think it i like it just being this

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.349 
think it i like it just being this
consistent<00:03:51.099> thing<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.519> one<00:03:51.730> thing<00:03:52.090> in

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
consistent thing it's the one thing in

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.390 
consistent thing it's the one thing in
destiny<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.109> is<00:03:53.319> probably<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.069> most

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
destiny that is probably the most

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.640 
destiny that is probably the most
balanced<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.389> most<00:03:55.720> balanced

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
balanced this is the most balanced

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.559 
balanced this is the most balanced
competitive<00:03:57.549> experience<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.239> we've<00:03:58.359> had<00:03:58.510> in

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
competitive experience that we've had in

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.690 
competitive experience that we've had in
destiny<00:03:59.019> so<00:03:59.230> far<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.919> really<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:00.549> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
destiny so far it really is it's the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.250 
destiny so far it really is it's the
it's<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.150> most<00:04:01.329> balanced<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.780> course<00:04:01.959> there's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
it's the most balanced of course there's

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.449 
it's the most balanced of course there's
weapons<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.709> this<00:04:02.799> game<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.130> are<00:04:03.280> not

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
weapons in this game that are not

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.640 
weapons in this game that are not
balanced<00:04:03.940> is<00:04:04.120> probably<00:04:04.599> classes<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.500> this

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
balanced is probably classes in this

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.009 
balanced is probably classes in this
game<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:05.980> are<00:04:06.130> not<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.519> well<00:04:06.760> balanced<00:04:07.329> but

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
game that are not that well balanced but

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.080 
game that are not that well balanced but
trousers<00:04:08.620> osiris<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.400> most<00:04:09.579> bouncing

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
trousers osiris is the most bouncing

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.909 
trousers osiris is the most bouncing
it's<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.419> most<00:04:10.599> consistent<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.380> i<00:04:11.709> think

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
it's the most consistent and i think

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.699 
it's the most consistent and i think
that<00:04:12.069> having<00:04:12.310> non<00:04:12.609> rotating<00:04:12.849> maps<00:04:13.359> is<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:14.590> a

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
that having non rotating maps is just a

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.250 
that having non rotating maps is just a
part<00:04:15.040> of<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.430> package<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:16.630> make<00:04:16.810> trials<00:04:17.139> of

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
part of that package that make trials of

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.259 
part of that package that make trials of
osiris<00:04:17.739> different<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.669> i<00:04:18.849> don't<00:04:19.030> know<00:04:19.120> i'm

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
osiris different but i don't know i'm

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.909 
osiris different but i don't know i'm
just<00:04:19.450> i'm<00:04:19.599> still<00:04:19.870> really<00:04:20.109> torn<00:04:20.410> because<00:04:20.590> when

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
just i'm still really torn because when

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.960 
just i'm still really torn because when
they<00:04:21.039> were<00:04:21.099> rotating

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
they were rotating

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.540 
they were rotating
I<00:04:22.030> did<00:04:22.420> enjoy<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.200> enjoyed<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:24.160> because<00:04:24.310> it's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
I did enjoy it I enjoyed it because it's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.740 
I did enjoy it I enjoyed it because it's
a<00:04:24.610> different<00:04:24.940> map<00:04:25.090> each<00:04:25.300> time<00:04:25.540> although

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
a different map each time although

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.650 
a different map each time although
sometimes<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.890> got<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.280> map<00:04:27.460> many<00:04:28.210> times<00:04:28.480> in

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
sometimes I got the map many times in

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.020 
sometimes I got the map many times in
their<00:04:28.780> own<00:04:28.950> but<00:04:29.950> in<00:04:30.100> general<00:04:30.460> it's<00:04:30.970> a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
their own but in general it's a

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.730 
their own but in general it's a
different<00:04:31.330> experience<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.960> swishes<00:04:32.230> switches

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
different experience it swishes switches

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.010 
different experience it swishes switches
it<00:04:32.890> up<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.310> makes<00:04:33.700> me<00:04:33.850> feel<00:04:34.030> fresh<00:04:34.420> it<00:04:34.630> made<00:04:34.870> me

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
it up it makes me feel fresh it made me

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020 
it up it makes me feel fresh it made me
want<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.260> continue<00:04:35.830> playing<00:04:35.980> all<00:04:36.370> weekend

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
want to continue playing all weekend

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.000 
want to continue playing all weekend
instead<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:37.870> doing<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.530> my<00:04:38.800> three

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
instead of doing like my three

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.100 
instead of doing like my three
characters<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.820> then<00:04:39.910> doing<00:04:40.120> my<00:04:40.390> fiancee<00:04:40.930> sue

characters and then doing my fiancee sue
characters<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.920> just<00:04:42.430> wanted<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:42.970> keep<00:04:43.390> playing

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
characters I just wanted to keep playing

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.200 
characters I just wanted to keep playing
because<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.110> switched<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.560> up<00:04:44.650> constantly<00:04:45.280> but

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
because it switched it up constantly but

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.330 
because it switched it up constantly but
on<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.420> same<00:04:46.600> hand<00:04:46.930> I've<00:04:47.200> been<00:04:47.440> really<00:04:47.950> on<00:04:48.250> the

playing on map so I'm really torn I'm

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.440 
playing on map so I'm really torn I'm
really<00:04:54.220> torn<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.670> think<00:04:54.880> from<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.120> viewers

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
really torn I think from a viewers

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.560 
really torn I think from a viewers
perspective<00:04:55.720> on<00:04:56.140> twitch<00:04:56.500> at<00:04:56.530> least<00:04:57.570> rotating

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
perspective on twitch at least rotating

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.330 
perspective on twitch at least rotating
is<00:04:58.690> probably<00:04:59.170> better<00:04:59.500> because<00:04:59.740> they<00:05:00.070> get<00:05:00.190> to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
is probably better because they get to

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.740 
is probably better because they get to
see<00:05:00.490> different<00:05:00.520> maps<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.240> maybe<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.540> seeing

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
see different maps and maybe just seeing

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.480 
see different maps and maybe just seeing
the<00:05:01.870> same<00:05:02.020> map<00:05:02.290> from<00:05:02.530> every<00:05:02.830> stream<00:05:03.100> it<00:05:03.250> gets

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
the same map from every stream it gets

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.670 
the same map from every stream it gets
kind<00:05:03.700> of<00:05:03.760> boring<00:05:03.820> but<00:05:04.690> yeah<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:04.870> think<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.410> think

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
kind of boring but yeah I think I think

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.730 
kind of boring but yeah I think I think
I<00:05:05.770> really<00:05:06.040> like<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.520> study<00:05:07.360> maps<00:05:07.630> man<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.230> think

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
I really like the study maps man I think

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.410 
I really like the study maps man I think
I<00:05:08.830> do<00:05:08.890> I<00:05:09.040> think<00:05:09.400> honestly<00:05:09.820> for<00:05:09.970> me<00:05:10.030> it's<00:05:10.330> a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
I do I think honestly for me it's a

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.650 
I do I think honestly for me it's a
little<00:05:10.690> too<00:05:10.930> hard<00:05:11.260> as<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.790> little<00:05:12.790> too<00:05:12.940> soon<00:05:13.270> and

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
hard for me to say yes the one map thing
