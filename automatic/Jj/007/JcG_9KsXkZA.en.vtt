2 3 turn step 1 - 1 2 3 turn alright so
you<00:03:15.940> gonna<00:03:16.090> do<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.329> twice<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:18.329> going<00:03:19.329> from

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
you gonna do that twice you going from

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.530 
you gonna do that twice you going from
the<00:03:19.780> transition<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.680> tape<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.519> up<00:03:21.639> 5<00:03:22.329> 6<00:03:23.160> 7<00:03:24.540> right

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the transition of tape it up 5 6 7 right

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.000 
the transition of tape it up 5 6 7 right
left<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:28.060> step<00:03:28.599> 1<00:03:29.440> 2<00:03:29.829> 1<00:03:30.250> 2<00:03:30.489> 3<00:03:30.849> turn<00:03:31.419> step<00:03:31.810> 1<00:03:32.620> -

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
left to out step 1 2 1 2 3 turn step 1 -

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.409 
left to out step 1 2 1 2 3 turn step 1 -
1<00:03:33.430> 2<00:03:33.819> 3<00:03:34.180> turn<00:03:34.769> all<00:03:35.769> right<00:03:35.889> your<00:03:36.879> next<00:03:37.030> step<00:03:37.299> from

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
1 2 3 turn all right your next step from

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.930 
1 2 3 turn all right your next step from
there<00:03:37.980> you're<00:03:38.980> going<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.190> go<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.519> lock<00:03:39.730> step

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
there you're going to go to a lock step

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.420 
there you're going to go to a lock step
so<00:03:40.930> from<00:03:41.260> next<00:03:41.440> transition<00:03:41.979> step<00:03:42.970> 1<00:03:43.840> -<00:03:44.229> 1<00:03:44.680> 2<00:03:45.069> 3

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
so from next transition step 1 - 1 2 3

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.839 
so from next transition step 1 - 1 2 3
turning<00:03:46.090> lock<00:03:46.269> step<00:03:46.690> right<00:03:47.109> lock<00:03:47.979> step<00:03:48.400> left

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
turning lock step right lock step left

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.939 
turning lock step right lock step left
step<00:03:49.590> turn<00:03:50.590> right<00:03:51.400> left<00:03:51.430> right<00:03:52.060> tap<00:03:52.799> all<00:03:53.799> right
