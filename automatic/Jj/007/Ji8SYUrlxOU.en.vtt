I realized that I had anxiety and that's
pretty<00:01:48.450> much<00:01:48.570> where<00:01:49.310> you're<00:01:50.310> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.820> worried

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
pretty much where you're kind of worried

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.710 
pretty much where you're kind of worried
to<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.659> anything<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.909> could<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
to do anything and it could be like the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.319 
to do anything and it could be like the
smallest<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.290> ever<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.640> be

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
smallest thing ever and you would be

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
smallest thing ever and you would be
worried<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.740> makes<00:01:59.040> no<00:01:59.130> sense

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
worried to do it and it makes no sense

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
worried to do it and it makes no sense
and<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.850> completely<00:02:00.240> illogical

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and it's completely illogical

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.620 
and it's completely illogical
but<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:03.240> you'd<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.079> worried<00:02:04.409> about<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.630> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
but like you'd be worried about it and I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.300 
but like you'd be worried about it and I
also<00:02:07.049> had<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.710> thing<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> high<00:02:08.700> school<00:02:09.000> where<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
also had a thing in high school where I

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.760 
also had a thing in high school where I
was<00:02:11.310> super<00:02:12.120> worried<00:02:13.020> what<00:02:13.230> people<00:02:13.530> thought

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
was super worried what people thought

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.420 
was super worried what people thought
well<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> mean<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:16.200> super<00:02:16.620> worried<00:02:16.920> but

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
well I mean not like super worried but

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
well I mean not like super worried but
like<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.900> example<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> liked

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
like for example I you know I liked

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.150 
like for example I you know I liked
obviously<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> lot<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.470> girls<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.770> high<00:02:22.920> school

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
obviously a lot of girls in high school

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.090 
obviously a lot of girls in high school
and<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.910> had<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.060> few<00:02:24.240> crushes<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.380> didn't

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
and I had a few crushes but I didn't

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.830 
and I had a few crushes but I didn't
really<00:02:26.220> pursue<00:02:26.730> any<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.120> them<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.600> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
really pursue any of them because I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
really pursue any of them because I
didn't<00:02:28.230> know<00:02:28.380> how<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:28.950> friends<00:02:29.400> would<00:02:29.550> think

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
didn't know how my friends would think

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.210 
didn't know how my friends would think
about<00:02:29.910> them<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:31.500> was<00:02:31.680> worried<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.100> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
about them and I was worried that I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.450 
about them and I was worried that I
would<00:02:32.430> look<00:02:32.960> down<00:02:33.960> upon<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:35.070> being<00:02:35.280> with

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
would look down upon for being with

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.380 
would look down upon for being with
someone<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.940> worried<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.210> my

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
someone and like I was worried that my

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.670 
someone and like I was worried that my
friends<00:02:39.690> wouldn't<00:02:39.990> like<00:02:40.140> them<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.560> they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
friends wouldn't like them and they

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.930 
friends wouldn't like them and they
would<00:02:40.830> think<00:02:41.010> worse<00:02:41.220> than<00:02:41.400> me<00:02:41.460> basically

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
would think worse than me basically

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.910 
would think worse than me basically
which<00:02:42.480> makes<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:42.810> sense<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.650> because

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
which makes no sense you know because

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.320 
which makes no sense you know because
they're<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.460> friends<00:02:44.850> they're<00:02:44.880> obviously

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
they're your friends they're obviously

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.540 
they're your friends they're obviously
gonna<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.780> who<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.550> kind

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
gonna like who you like and so that kind

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.290 
gonna like who you like and so that kind
of<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:52.070> yeah<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.100> makes<00:02:53.550> no<00:02:53.790> sense<00:02:54.060> at<00:02:54.180> all

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
of like yeah that makes no sense at all

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.540 
of like yeah that makes no sense at all
and<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.780> don't<00:02:55.200> know<00:02:55.290> why<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> was<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.130> but

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and I don't know why I was like that but

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.790 
and I don't know why I was like that but
you<00:02:57.450> know<00:02:57.540> that's<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.870> something<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.440> I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you know that's just something that I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.380 
you know that's just something that I
had<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> go<00:02:59.220> through<00:02:59.490> when<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.300> high

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
this YouTube thing and around that time

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.800 
this YouTube thing and around that time
my<00:03:40.200> mom<00:03:40.820> she<00:03:41.820> got<00:03:42.209> super<00:03:42.570> sick<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.340> she<00:03:44.340> was

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
of mental problems my grandpa and so she

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
had to basically go to a mental hospital

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.140 
had to basically go to a mental hospital
because<00:03:57.750> she<00:03:58.080> was<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.530> sick<00:03:58.890> were<00:03:59.520> like<00:03:59.760> you

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
because she was so sick were like you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.540 
because she was so sick were like you
could<00:04:00.810> say<00:04:01.020> something<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.530> her<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:02.430> would

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
could say something to her and it would

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.280 
could say something to her and it would
take<00:04:02.730> her<00:04:02.880> like<00:04:03.060> ten<00:04:03.300> seconds<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.810> respond<00:04:04.140> and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
take her like ten seconds to respond and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.500 
take her like ten seconds to respond and
it<00:04:05.220> would<00:04:05.340> be<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.730> shortest<00:04:06.120> answer

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
it would be like the shortest answer

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.280 
it would be like the shortest answer
ever<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:07.820> she<00:04:08.820> just<00:04:09.240> wouldn't<00:04:09.780> really<00:04:10.020> talk
