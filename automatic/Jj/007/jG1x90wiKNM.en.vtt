00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
today we're putting the dry wells in the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.529 
today we're putting the dry wells in the
ground<00:00:21.810> that's<00:00:22.290> those<00:00:22.860> two<00:00:23.270> containers<00:00:24.270> over

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
ground that's those two containers over

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.290 
ground that's those two containers over
there<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:26.150> that's<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.810> manage<00:00:28.320> storm<00:00:28.710> water

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
there and that's to manage storm water

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.869 
there and that's to manage storm water
the<00:00:30.300> town<00:00:30.510> has<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.529> flooding<00:00:31.949> problem

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
the town has a you know flooding problem

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.720 
the town has a you know flooding problem
I<00:00:32.970> guess<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.769> so<00:00:34.769> what<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:34.980> make<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
I guess and so what they make you do is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
I guess and so what they make you do is
when<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.390> addition<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:36.930> over

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
when you have an addition that's over

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.890 
when you have an addition that's over
that<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.610> increases<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.269> footprint<00:00:39.750> over

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
that that increases the footprint over

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.380 
that that increases the footprint over
four<00:00:40.650> hundred<00:00:40.680> square<00:00:41.190> feet<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.940> least<00:00:42.000> around

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
four hundred square feet at least around

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.180 
four hundred square feet at least around
here<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.830> have<00:00:43.979> you<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.600> run<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
here what they have you do is run the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.130 
here what they have you do is run the
you<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.790> gutters<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you know the the gutters or the the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.329 
you know the the gutters or the the
leaders<00:00:49.409> here<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:51.479> know<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:52.739> put<00:00:52.769> the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
leaders here you know they you put the

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.729 
leaders here you know they you put the
pipe<00:00:53.519> underground<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> pipe<00:00:55.080> it<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.379> over

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pipe underground and you pipe it on over

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.710 
pipe underground and you pipe it on over
to<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> dry<00:00:58.320> wells<00:00:58.589> and<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.549> you<00:01:00.360> can<00:01:00.570> see

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
to to the dry wells and that you can see

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.439 
to to the dry wells and that you can see
that's<00:01:00.839> filled<00:01:01.229> with<00:01:01.320> holes<00:01:01.589> and<00:01:02.119> it<00:01:03.119> seeps

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that's filled with holes and it seeps

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.140 
that's filled with holes and it seeps
the<00:01:03.659> water<00:01:03.869> into<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.530> ground<00:01:04.830> slowly<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the water into the ground slowly in that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.070 
the water into the ground slowly in that
way<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.710> set<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> water<00:01:09.080> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
way you don't have all set of water you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:44.390 
way you don't have all set of water you
see<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.440> have<00:01:10.560> stone<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.490> being<00:01:11.760> delivered

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.330 

so<00:01:45.990> anyway<00:01:46.990> like<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.440> was<00:01:47.470> saying<00:01:47.590> today's<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
so anyway like I was saying today's the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.160 
so anyway like I was saying today's the
day<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.790> we're<00:01:49.450> digging<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:49.870> putting<00:01:50.080> these

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
day that we're digging and putting these

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.460 
day that we're digging and putting these
in<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:51.340> we<00:01:51.640> measured<00:01:52.000> out<00:01:52.210> based<00:01:52.870> on<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.170> plans

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
in so we measured out based on the plans

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.609 
in so we measured out based on the plans
you<00:01:54.430> know<00:01:54.550> how<00:01:54.729> big<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.210> how<00:01:55.390> deep<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.410> wide

you know how big and how deep and wide

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.700 
you know how big and how deep and wide
and<00:01:57.100> long<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.330> pit<00:01:58.900> needs<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.290> be<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:01.300> know

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and long the pit needs to be you know

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.969 
and long the pit needs to be you know
only<00:02:02.710> part<00:02:03.400> of<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.550> way<00:02:03.640> done<00:02:03.850> right<00:02:04.119> now<00:02:04.979> but

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
only part of the way done right now but

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.279 
only part of the way done right now but
anyway<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:07.000> we<00:02:07.030> got<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.360> finish<00:02:07.720> digging<00:02:08.050> this

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
anyway so we got to finish digging this

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.260 
anyway so we got to finish digging this
pit<00:02:08.500> out<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:09.009> then<00:02:09.640> we're<00:02:09.789> gonna<00:02:09.880> put<00:02:10.240> a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
pit out and then we're gonna put a

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.110 
pit out and then we're gonna put a
filter<00:02:11.080> fabric<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.459> bottom<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
filter fabric in the bottom and on the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.000 
filter fabric in the bottom and on the
sides<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.459> then<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> wait<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:17.020> the

sides and then we have to wait for the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.030 
sides and then we have to wait for the
engineer<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.910> come<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.290> town<00:02:20.530> engineer

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
to come and inspect all of that once he

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.460 
to come and inspect all of that once he
sees<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.390> pits<00:02:25.600> dug<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.170> filter

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
sees that the pits dug and the filter

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.680 
sees that the pits dug and the filter
fabrics<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.070> there<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:28.209> stone<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
fabrics in there and the stone is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.690 
fabrics in there and the stone is
on-site<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.160> passed<00:02:30.370> that
