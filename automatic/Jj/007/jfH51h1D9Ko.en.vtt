semi-automatic or automatic settings but

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
semi-automatic or automatic settings but
there<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> period<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> time<00:00:43.410> where<00:00:43.649> you

there is a period of time where you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
there is a period of time where you
cannot<00:00:44.070> shoot<00:00:44.489> after<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.420> shoot<00:00:45.750> those<00:00:45.930> three

cannot shoot after you shoot those three
round<00:00:46.469> bursts<00:00:46.920> however<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.430> really

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
round bursts however it's not really

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.240 
round bursts however it's not really
that<00:00:47.850> long<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> Glock<00:00:49.500> burst<00:00:49.980> fire

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that long with the Glock burst fire

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580 
that long with the Glock burst fire
sometimes<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.480> used<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.320> really

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
sometimes is used but it's not really

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.220 
sometimes is used but it's not really
super<00:00:52.890> effective<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> fires<00:00:54.390> three<00:00:54.809> rounds

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
super effective it fires three rounds

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
super effective it fires three rounds
very<00:00:55.440> quickly<00:00:55.739> following<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.730> recoil

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
very quickly following the recoil

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540 
very quickly following the recoil
pattern<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.109> very<00:00:58.530> inconsistent<00:00:59.219> where

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
pattern but it's very inconsistent where

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
pattern but it's very inconsistent where
the<00:00:59.699> rounds<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.020> only<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.530> useful

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the rounds go so it's only really useful

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
the rounds go so it's only really useful
at<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.370> close<00:01:02.760> range<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.989> means<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
at very close range but this means to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
at very close range but this means to
use<00:01:04.589> burst<00:01:04.890> fire<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> Glock<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.760> click

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
use burst fire with the Glock you click

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
use burst fire with the Glock you click
and<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> pull<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.680> slightly<00:01:08.159> as

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and you have to pull down slightly as

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
and you have to pull down slightly as
the<00:01:08.549> rounds<00:01:09.060> come<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> does

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the rounds come out because it does

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.590 
the rounds come out because it does
follow<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> recoil<00:01:11.040> pattern<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> Glock<00:01:12.390> has

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
follow the recoil pattern the Glock has

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
follow the recoil pattern the Glock has
very<00:01:12.840> low<00:01:13.049> armor<00:01:13.380> penetration<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.250> low

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
very low armor penetration and very low

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
very low armor penetration and very low
damage<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.270> getting<00:01:15.540> three<00:01:15.750> shots<00:01:16.020> very

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
damage so getting three shots very

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
damage so getting three shots very
quickly<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:17.280> idea<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.700> eco<00:01:18.299> rounds<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
quickly is a good idea on eco rounds it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
quickly is a good idea on eco rounds it
will<00:01:19.140> make<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> easier<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> take<00:01:20.009> down<00:01:20.070> armored

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
will make it easier to take down armored

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.480 
will make it easier to take down armored
opponents<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.540> close<00:01:21.900> distances<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.920> all

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
opponents at very close distances if all

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
opponents at very close distances if all
three<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.939> those<00:01:24.119> shots<00:01:24.450> hit<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.990> head

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
three of those shots hit the head

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
three of those shots hit the head
when<00:01:25.799> burst<00:01:26.040> firing<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> Glock<00:01:26.820> always

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
when burst firing with the Glock always

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.960 
when burst firing with the Glock always
go<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.049> headshot<00:01:28.340> keep<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.520> mind<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
go for that headshot keep in mind it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
go for that headshot keep in mind it
makes<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.390> sense<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.869> purchase<00:01:31.259> ap-250<00:01:31.829> at

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
makes more sense to purchase ap-250 at

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
makes more sense to purchase ap-250 at
just<00:01:32.310> 300<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:32.939> eco<00:01:33.180> rounds<00:01:33.509> instead<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
just 300 on eco rounds instead of the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
just 300 on eco rounds instead of the
Glock<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.009> sometimes<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
Glock but sometimes all you have is a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.380 
Glock but sometimes all you have is a
Glock<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> FAMAS<00:01:38.070> burst<00:01:38.460> fire<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.090> kind

Glock for the FAMAS burst fire is kind

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
Glock for the FAMAS burst fire is kind
of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.780> burst<00:01:40.380> fire<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> still<00:01:40.979> at<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
of the same burst fire is still at a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
of the same burst fire is still at a
higher<00:01:41.430> rate<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.700> fire<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.329> first<00:01:42.390> three

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
higher rate of fire for the first three

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
higher rate of fire for the first three
rounds<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> FAMAS<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.579> you're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
rounds with the FAMAS then if you're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
rounds with the FAMAS then if you're
just<00:01:44.820> shooting<00:01:45.000> automatic<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> fama

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
just shooting automatic because the fama

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.440 
just shooting automatic because the fama
s--<00:01:46.979> doesn't<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:47.970> damage<00:01:48.000> as

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
s-- doesn't really do as much damage as

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
s-- doesn't really do as much damage as
other<00:01:48.659> rifles<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.229> makes<00:01:49.770> sense<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> want<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
other rifles it makes sense to want to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.069 
other rifles it makes sense to want to
shoot<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> higher<00:01:51.090> fire<00:01:51.450> rate<00:01:51.479> because

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
shoot at a higher fire rate because

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.160 
shoot at a higher fire rate because
higher<00:01:52.290> fire<00:01:52.619> rate<00:01:52.649> means<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.729> bullets

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
higher fire rate means more bullets

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
higher fire rate means more bullets
think<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.950> ak-47<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
think of it this way the ak-47 is a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.270 
think of it this way the ak-47 is a
one-hit<00:01:57.420> headshot<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.409> Faunus<00:01:58.890> may<00:01:59.070> take

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
one-hit headshot the Faunus may take

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510 
one-hit headshot the Faunus may take
three<00:01:59.670> at<00:01:59.909> certain<00:02:00.360> distances<00:02:00.899> or<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.250> if

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
three at certain distances or two so if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
three at certain distances or two so if
you<00:02:02.790> shoot<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.240> three<00:02:03.600> shots<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> same

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you shoot all three shots at the same

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.330 
you shoot all three shots at the same
time<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.979> becomes<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.060> one-hit<00:02:06.509> headshot

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
time it becomes a one-hit headshot

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
time it becomes a one-hit headshot
however<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.759> rounds<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.300> exactly

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
however the rounds are not exactly

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.750 
however the rounds are not exactly
consistent<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> pomace<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.610> don't

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
consistent on the pomace they don't

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760 
consistent on the pomace they don't
always<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.720> same<00:02:12.900> spot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
always go to the same spot

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
always go to the same spot
with<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.160> practice<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.030> some

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
with some practice you can get some

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.690 
with some practice you can get some
pretty<00:02:15.510> consistent<00:02:16.290> patterns<00:02:16.710> out<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.580> as

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
pretty consistent patterns out of it as

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.370 
pretty consistent patterns out of it as
you<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:17.880> see<00:02:18.000> me<00:02:18.120> doing<00:02:18.270> here<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.660> wall<00:02:18.840> at

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
you can see me doing here on the wall at

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.100 
you can see me doing here on the wall at
like<00:02:19.950> medium<00:02:20.400> distance<00:02:21.300> not<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:21.720> much<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:22.020> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
like medium distance not so much at the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.690 
like medium distance not so much at the
longer<00:02:22.350> distances<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.070> think<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.640> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
longer distances I don't think so it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
longer distances I don't think so it
goes<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.090> into<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.480> left<00:02:24.660> just<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.140> tiny<00:02:25.620> little

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
goes up into the left just a tiny little

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.670 
goes up into the left just a tiny little
bit<00:02:26.220> there<00:02:26.750> whereas<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.930> regular<00:02:28.260> spray<00:02:28.500> with

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
bit there whereas the regular spray with

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890 
bit there whereas the regular spray with
the<00:02:28.770> FAMAS<00:02:29.070> goes<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.580> into<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.940> right<00:02:30.180> so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
the FAMAS goes up into the right so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.650 
the FAMAS goes up into the right so
they're<00:02:31.260> very<00:02:31.290> different<00:02:31.800> using<00:02:32.370> burst-fire

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
they're very different using burst-fire

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.930 
they're very different using burst-fire
versus<00:02:33.660> using<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.020> automatic<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
versus using the automatic you do it the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940 
versus using the automatic you do it the
same<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> Glock<00:02:36.930> click<00:02:37.440> once<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
same way as the Glock click once and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.800 
same way as the Glock click once and
then<00:02:38.160> pull<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.610> slightly<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> rounds

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
then pull down slightly as the rounds

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.120 
then pull down slightly as the rounds
come<00:02:39.990> out<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.470> move<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
come out and move a little bit to the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.980 
come out and move a little bit to the
right<00:02:41.160> with<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> FAMAS<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.390> takes<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.720> little

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
right with the FAMAS it takes a little

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.040 
right with the FAMAS it takes a little
bit<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.170> practice<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.770> used<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:45.150> once

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
bit of practice to get used to but once

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.350 
bit of practice to get used to but once
you<00:02:46.260> get<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.580> useful<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.180> those

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
you get it it can be useful in those

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.410 
you get it it can be useful in those
