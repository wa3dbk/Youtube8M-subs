 so it's a collection that we just 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.720
 launch where we take the elements of 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.200
 that gave us the focus on the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.050
 skin 100% and good in this case in this case 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.110

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.120
 presentations leather and fur 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.460
 list as such but also in drilling 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.150
 leader we bring the color block is 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.750
 still very very very important within 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.700
 our trend and good collection 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.119
 is made up of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.820
 for very relaxed bags but at the same time 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.620
 sophisticated as moles like carl jones 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.770
 that we can see from this side 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.250
 also surrounded by mini accessories like 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.330
 the portfolios 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.330
 some things 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.720
 the type is clear 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.840
 they are things with a lot of novelty but in the end 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.929
 of accounts keeping the spirit of 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.039
 the coach files and good at 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.310
 general terms 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.560
