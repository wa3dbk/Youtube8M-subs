00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.959 
this pan for my wedding I been looking
at<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> clear<00:00:34.920> lenses<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.640> sort<00:00:35.879> of

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
at the clear lenses which I sort of

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
at the clear lenses which I sort of
liked<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.230> wanted<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> pick<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.829> pair<00:00:38.040> but

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
liked and I wanted to pick up a pair but

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.290 
liked and I wanted to pick up a pair but
there<00:00:38.340> weren't<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.670> many<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there weren't really many out there that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.990 
there weren't really many out there that
had<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.629> clear<00:00:39.840> option<00:00:40.020> except<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.710> these

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
had the clear option except for these

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
had the clear option except for these
however<00:00:42.000> unlike<00:00:42.930> most<00:00:42.960> wires<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.829> went

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
however unlike most wires which went

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
however unlike most wires which went
around<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.550> 150<00:00:45.180> 160

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
around like 150 160

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.830 
around like 150 160
these<00:00:46.560> were<00:00:46.829> 225<00:00:47.400> which<00:00:47.790> is<00:00:47.910> only<00:00:48.030> about<00:00:48.180> $50

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
these were 225 which is only about $50

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
these were 225 which is only about $50
cheaper<00:00:49.020> than<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.470> ex<00:00:49.590> metals<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.250> time

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
cheaper than the ex metals at the time

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.270 
cheaper than the ex metals at the time
so<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> put<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.540> on<00:00:51.600> hold<00:00:51.750> didn't<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so I put them on hold didn't really you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590 
so I put them on hold didn't really you
know<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.520> after<00:00:53.700> them<00:00:53.910> perceive<00:00:54.270> them<00:00:54.390> much

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
know going after them perceive them much

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.650 
know going after them perceive them much

change and makes you appreciate what you
had<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.430> I'm<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:50.939> over<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
had so I'm just going to go over the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
had so I'm just going to go over the
glasses<00:01:51.360> their<00:01:51.780> model<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.650> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
glasses their model up here with the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.120 
glasses their model up here with the
square<00:01:53.100> wire<00:01:53.310> 2.0<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.960> original<00:01:55.409> T<00:01:55.619> wire<00:01:55.830> was

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
square wire 2.0 the original T wire was

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
square wire 2.0 the original T wire was
modeled<00:01:56.430> after<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.790> e<00:01:56.820> wire<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.990> 1999

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
modeled after the e wire but in 1999

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.200 
modeled after the e wire but in 1999
when<00:01:58.830> they<00:01:58.950> had<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> whole<00:01:59.460> product<00:01:59.790> change

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
when they had the whole product change

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.340 
when they had the whole product change
and<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.479> moved<00:02:00.689> everything<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and they moved everything over to the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.560 
and they moved everything over to the
new<00:02:01.530> icons<00:02:01.920> new<00:02:02.159> designs<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:02.939> did<00:02:03.150> all

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
new icons new designs that we did all

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.030 
new icons new designs that we did all
the<00:02:03.869> wires<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.530> did<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> lot<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the wires that we did a lot of the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.609 
the wires that we did a lot of the
jackets<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.420> things<00:02:06.570> change<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> 1999

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
jackets a lot of things change in 1999

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.649 
jackets a lot of things change in 1999
this<00:02:08.369> changed<00:02:08.729> along<00:02:08.939> with<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.479> moved

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
this changed along with it and it moved

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.110 
this changed along with it and it moved
to<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> square<00:02:10.170> wire<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:11.250> square<00:02:11.760> wire<00:02:11.909> came

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
to the square wire now square wire came

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880 
to the square wire now square wire came
to<00:02:12.209> -<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.599> came<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.379> regular<00:02:13.530> hinge

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to - it came in this the regular hinge

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.920 
to - it came in this the regular hinge
and<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.189> spring<00:02:14.459> hinge<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:15.269> model<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:15.750> just

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and the spring hinge this model is just

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.690 
and the spring hinge this model is just
the<00:02:16.140> regular<00:02:16.319> swinging<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.340> it's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the regular swinging so it's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.059 
the regular swinging so it's
the<00:02:17.819> screen<00:02:18.090> hinge<00:02:18.300> models<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.990> there<00:02:19.950> really

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
the screen hinge models so there really

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.890 
the screen hinge models so there really
isn't<00:02:20.370> any<00:02:20.580> flex<00:02:20.940> aside<00:02:21.270> from<00:02:21.450> what<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.750> get

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
isn't any flex aside from what you get

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.229 
isn't any flex aside from what you get
in<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> frame<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:23.040> since<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.370> titanium<00:02:23.880> you

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
in the frame but since it's titanium you

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.790 
in the frame but since it's titanium you
can<00:02:24.420> bend<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> lot<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.349> not<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.739> to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
can bend this a lot it's not going to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.150 
can bend this a lot it's not going to
have<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> problem<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.690> nose<00:02:28.260> bridge<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.739> welded

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
have a problem the nose bridge is welded

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.920 
have a problem the nose bridge is welded
so<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.849> curly<00:02:30.180> getting<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.510> loosen<00:02:30.840> up

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so that's not curly getting it loosen up

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.290 
so that's not curly getting it loosen up
over<00:02:31.140> time<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.650> should<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.950> rock-solid

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
over time so that should be rock-solid

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
over time so that should be rock-solid
the<00:02:33.300> only<00:02:33.510> give<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.050> may<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.709> in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
the only give you may have is just in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.520 
the only give you may have is just in
the<00:02:35.040> sprit<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.790> screw<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.319> where<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the sprit of the screw here where the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.280 
the sprit of the screw here where the
from<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.790> where<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.030> stem<00:02:39.810> basically

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
from you know where the stem basically

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.660 
from you know where the stem basically
rotates<00:02:43.010> traditional<00:02:44.010> nose<00:02:44.160> bottoms<00:02:44.580> are

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
rotates traditional nose bottoms are

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.030 
rotates traditional nose bottoms are
here<00:02:44.910> they're<00:02:45.090> basically<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:46.260> removable

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
here they're basically not removable

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.309 
here they're basically not removable
there's<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.489> Lu<00:02:47.760> looped<00:02:48.510> wires<00:02:48.780> here<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
there's just Lu looped wires here that

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.680 
there's just Lu looped wires here that
have<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.680> pads<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:51.060> keeps<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.480> your

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
have the pads and that keeps it on your

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.960 
have the pads and that keeps it on your
face<00:02:51.900> there's<00:02:52.680> ear<00:02:52.980> socks<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.459> either<00:02:53.610> side

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
face there's ear socks on either side

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.240 
face there's ear socks on either side
when<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> took<00:02:55.140> these<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.560> notice<00:02:55.950> there's<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
when I took these out I notice there's a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.130 
when I took these out I notice there's a
little<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.549> gumminess<00:02:56.910> here<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.540> lot<00:02:58.019> of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
little bit of gumminess here a lot of

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.199 
little bit of gumminess here a lot of
times<00:02:58.350> lighter<00:02:58.799> unobtainium<00:02:59.640> tends<00:02:59.970> to

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
times lighter unobtainium tends to

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.660 
times lighter unobtainium tends to
degrade<00:03:00.390> over<00:03:00.750> time<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.380> also<00:03:02.100> noticed<00:03:02.489> this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
degrade over time I also noticed this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.600 
degrade over time I also noticed this
with<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.120> orange<00:03:03.690> ones<00:03:03.930> too<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:05.459> main

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
with the orange ones too the main

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.360 
with the orange ones too the main
problem<00:03:06.030> with<00:03:06.470> unobtainium<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.950> over

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
problem with unobtainium is that over

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.740 
problem with unobtainium is that over
time<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.730> absorbs<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:09.150> sweat<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.630> that's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
time and absorbs your sweat and that's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.059 
time and absorbs your sweat and that's
kind<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.989> what<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.230> designed<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.650> do

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
kind of what it's designed to do

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.280 
kind of what it's designed to do
but<00:03:11.580> when<00:03:11.700> de<00:03:11.819> absorbs<00:03:12.209> your<00:03:12.330> sweat<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.989> sort

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
but when de absorbs your sweat it sort

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.199 
but when de absorbs your sweat it sort
of<00:03:13.350> keeps<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.739> there<00:03:13.799> however<00:03:14.340> my<00:03:14.760> noob<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
of keeps it there however my noob and

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.910 
of keeps it there however my noob and
then<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> right<00:03:16.500> conditions

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
then you know the right conditions

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.410 
then you know the right conditions
happened<00:03:17.310> they'll<00:03:17.489> slovenly<00:03:17.760> release<00:03:18.239> all

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
happened they'll slovenly release all

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.020 
happened they'll slovenly release all
that<00:03:18.450> water<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.590> moisture<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.700> tended

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
that water or moisture and I tended

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.880 
that water or moisture and I tended
somebody<00:03:21.330> gummy<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:21.930> leak<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.500> get<00:03:22.680> all<00:03:22.769> so

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
somebody gummy they leak they get all so

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.430 
somebody gummy they leak they get all so
it's<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.160> gross<00:03:23.609> stuff<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.299> not<00:03:25.140> terribly

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
it's a gross stuff so not terribly

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.720 
it's a gross stuff so not terribly
Pleasant<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.980> just<00:03:26.160> sort<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.310> wiped<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.609> off

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
Pleasant I just sort of wiped it off

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.970 
Pleasant I just sort of wiped it off
with<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:27.000> wet<00:03:27.180> towel<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.989> dried<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.769> seems

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
with a wet towel and dried it it seems

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.120 
with a wet towel and dried it it seems
to<00:03:29.070> be<00:03:29.160> okay<00:03:29.250> now<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.940> little<00:03:30.720> tacky<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.680> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
to be okay now a little tacky but you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.430 
to be okay now a little tacky but you
know<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.090> kind<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.420> purpose<00:03:33.660> it's

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
know it is kind of the purpose it's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.900 
know it is kind of the purpose it's
meant<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.890> used<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.280> meant<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.670> sort<00:03:35.850> of

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
meant to be used as meant to sort of

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.750 
meant to be used as meant to sort of
that<00:03:36.060> purpose<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:37.100> did<00:03:38.100> wear<00:03:38.250> these<00:03:38.459> quite

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
that purpose but I did wear these quite

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.539 
that purpose but I did wear these quite
a<00:03:38.790> lot<00:03:39.060> especially<00:03:39.269> for<00:03:39.660> nighttime<00:03:39.870> driving

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
a lot especially for nighttime driving

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.940 
a lot especially for nighttime driving
and<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.850> know<00:03:42.000> when<00:03:42.870> things<00:03:42.989> get<00:03:43.200> used<00:03:43.470> they

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and you know when things get used they

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.920 
and you know when things get used they
tend<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:45.120> some<00:03:45.299> sort<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.510> wear<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.690> tear

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
tend to have some sort of wear and tear

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.930 
tend to have some sort of wear and tear
on<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.549> sort<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.820> way<00:03:47.850> it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
on it so it is just sort of the way it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.259 
on it so it is just sort of the way it
is<00:03:48.560> overall<00:03:49.560> they're<00:03:49.890> very<00:03:50.130> light<00:03:50.459> obviously

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
is overall they're very light obviously

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.880 
is overall they're very light obviously
the<00:03:51.390> titanium<00:03:51.900> versus<00:03:52.170> aluminum<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.739> do

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
the titanium versus aluminum you do

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.400 
the titanium versus aluminum you do
notice<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.310> difference<00:03:54.140> currently<00:03:55.140> wearing<00:03:55.290> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
notice a difference currently wearing a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.229 
notice a difference currently wearing a
pair<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.620> cross<00:03:55.920> hairs<00:03:56.160> now<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.489> titanium<00:03:56.790> and

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
pair of cross hairs now in titanium and

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.240 
pair of cross hairs now in titanium and
it's<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.420> night<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.720> day<00:03:57.780> difference<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.440> you

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
it's a night and day difference it's you

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.890 
it's a night and day difference it's you
know<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.400> don't<00:03:59.519> hardly<00:04:00.000> feel<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.359> on<00:04:00.510> it's<00:04:00.810> a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
know you don't hardly feel it on it's a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.050 
know you don't hardly feel it on it's a
wonderful<00:04:01.319> piece<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.620> wear<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.190> they<00:04:02.819> really

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
wonderful piece to wear and they really

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.160 
wonderful piece to wear and they really
do<00:04:03.180> something<00:04:03.359> different<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.930> these<00:04:03.989> are

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
do something different and these are

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.370 
do something different and these are
even<00:04:04.410> lighter<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.930> height<00:04:06.930> difference

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
even lighter the height difference

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.349 
even lighter the height difference
between<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.280> cross<00:04:08.459> hair<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:08.940> square

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
between the cross hair and the square

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.819 
between the cross hair and the square
wire<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.810> t<00:04:09.959> wire<00:04:10.140> is<00:04:10.319> obviously<00:04:10.650> going

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
wire and the t wire is obviously going

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.220 
wire and the t wire is obviously going
to<00:04:10.890> be<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.040> lot<00:04:11.190> different<00:04:11.930> just<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.019> kind<00:04:13.200> of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
to be a lot different just to kind of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.349 
to be a lot different just to kind of
wear<00:04:13.380> these<00:04:13.500> on<00:04:13.940> then<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.030> see<00:04:15.180> what<00:04:15.209> the

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
wear these on then I see what the

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.060 
wear these on then I see what the
titanium<00:04:15.840> iridium<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:16.739> get<00:04:16.889> sort

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
titanium iridium is that you do get sort

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.319 
titanium iridium is that you do get sort
of<00:04:17.130> an<00:04:17.220> iridium<00:04:17.549> there<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:17.850> it's<00:04:17.970> not<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.120> pure

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
of an iridium there so it's not a pure

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.349 
of an iridium there so it's not a pure
clear<00:04:18.690> lens<00:04:19.160> but<00:04:20.160> as<00:04:20.639> far<00:04:20.820> as<00:04:20.910> looking<00:04:21.090> through

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
clear lens but as far as looking through

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.610 
clear lens but as far as looking through
it<00:04:21.389> you<00:04:21.570> don't<00:04:21.630> really<00:04:21.900> lose<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.079> lot<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.410> light

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
it you don't really lose a lot of light

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.650 
it you don't really lose a lot of light
so<00:04:22.860> that's<00:04:22.979> nice<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.490> don't<00:04:24.240> really<00:04:24.479> see<00:04:24.630> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
so that's nice I don't really see a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.909 
so that's nice I don't really see a
whole<00:04:24.810> difference<00:04:25.200> between<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.740> know<00:04:25.800> it

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
whole difference between you know it

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.320 
whole difference between you know it
being<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.370> shorter<00:04:26.669> lens<00:04:26.849> because<00:04:27.180> there's

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
being a shorter lens because there's

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.580 
being a shorter lens because there's
nothing<00:04:27.479> up<00:04:27.690> here<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.050> don't<00:04:28.260> really<00:04:28.380> see<00:04:28.560> a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
nothing up here I don't really see a

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
nothing up here I don't really see a
whole<00:04:28.740> lot<00:04:28.890> down<00:04:29.039> there<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.400> you

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
whole lot down there so you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.490 
whole lot down there so you
really<00:04:29.789> need<00:04:29.909> a<00:04:29.970> huge<00:04:30.300> aviator<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:31.020> cover<00:04:31.229> your

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
really need a huge aviator to cover your

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.800 
really need a huge aviator to cover your
vision<00:04:32.009> but<00:04:32.580> now<00:04:32.699> some<00:04:32.909> people<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.360> tends<00:04:33.720> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
vision but now some people it tends to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.210 
vision but now some people it tends to
write<00:04:34.020> down<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.229> bit<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.590> they<00:04:34.680> can<00:04:34.830> see<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.009> lot

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
write down a bit and they can see a lot

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.129 
write down a bit and they can see a lot
in<00:04:35.370> there<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:35.819> depending<00:04:36.479> on<00:04:36.569> how<00:04:36.750> your<00:04:36.960> face

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
in there so depending on how your face

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.010 
in there so depending on how your face
is<00:04:37.349> shaped<00:04:38.069> you<00:04:38.729> may<00:04:39.000> get<00:04:39.180> slightly<00:04:39.539> different

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
is shaped you may get slightly different

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.350 
is shaped you may get slightly different
where<00:04:42.860> one<00:04:43.860> point<00:04:44.400> if<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.550> mentioned<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
where one point if I mentioned that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.719 
where one point if I mentioned that
these<00:04:46.289> lenses<00:04:46.710> are<00:04:46.770> actually<00:04:47.129> too<00:04:47.280> small<00:04:47.310> to

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
these lenses are actually too small to

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.399 
these lenses are actually too small to
be<00:04:47.759> sold<00:04:48.030> in<00:04:48.150> Australia<00:04:48.719> so<00:04:49.080> that's<00:04:49.259> why

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
be sold in Australia so that's why

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.320 
be sold in Australia so that's why
sometimes<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.979> have<00:04:50.159> a<00:04:50.189> square<00:04:50.610> wire<00:04:50.819> 30

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
sometimes you have a square wire 30

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.670 
sometimes you have a square wire 30
millimeter<00:04:51.840> which<00:04:52.020> has<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.199> slightly<00:04:52.469> larger

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
millimeter which has a slightly larger

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.129 
millimeter which has a slightly larger
lens<00:04:53.069> so<00:04:53.849> if<00:04:54.090> you're<00:04:54.210> in<00:04:54.300> Australia<00:04:54.479> if<00:04:55.020> I

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
lens so if you're in Australia if I

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.540 
lens so if you're in Australia if I
don't<00:04:55.289> believe<00:04:55.469> this<00:04:55.620> very<00:04:55.830> actually<00:04:56.310> able<00:04:56.460> to

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
don't believe this very actually able to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.580 
don't believe this very actually able to
be<00:04:56.699> legally<00:04:57.090> sold<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:58.110> you're<00:04:58.259> only<00:04:58.319> going<00:04:58.439> to

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
be legally sold so you're only going to
