question<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> patient<00:01:06.330> anesthetized

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
question it was the patient anesthetized

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.000 
question it was the patient anesthetized
most<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> time<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.560> I'm<00:01:10.680> performing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
most of the time when I'm performing

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.969 
most of the time when I'm performing
endodontics<00:01:11.960> unless<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.560> case<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
endodontics unless I know the case is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
endodontics unless I know the case is
extremely<00:01:14.340> non-vital<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.479> will<00:01:15.689> anesthetize

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
extremely non-vital I will anesthetize

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
extremely non-vital I will anesthetize
because<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.460> could<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.000> vital<00:01:18.299> tissue

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
because there could be some vital tissue

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.109 
because there could be some vital tissue
laying<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.159> those<00:01:20.280> lateral<00:01:20.820> canals

laying around and those lateral canals

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
laying around and those lateral canals
and<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> patient<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.110> experience<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and the patient will experience that and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.130 
and the patient will experience that and
I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.630> them<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.990> that

when<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> performed<00:01:32.280> pips<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> first<00:01:32.970> time

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
when I performed pips for the first time

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.930 
when I performed pips for the first time
here<00:01:35.090> what<00:01:36.090> he<00:01:36.750> experienced<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.070> pulses

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
here what he experienced was the pulses

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.969 
here what he experienced was the pulses
of<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.450> photon<00:01:39.930> induced<00:01:40.409> photoacoustic

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of this photon induced photoacoustic

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.430 
of this photon induced photoacoustic
streaming<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> fluid<00:01:42.420> he<00:01:42.960> could<00:01:43.140> feel<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
streaming of the fluid he could feel the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.999 
streaming of the fluid he could feel the
pulses<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.280> his<00:01:44.790> entire<00:01:45.180> mandible<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pulses in his entire mandible and it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
pulses in his entire mandible and it
being<00:01:47.759> amazed<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.540> such<00:01:48.720> low<00:01:48.960> energy<00:01:49.409> settings

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
being amazed at such low energy settings

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
being amazed at such low energy settings
that<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.070> could<00:01:50.250> experience<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.149> feel

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that he could experience that and feel

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.859 
that he could experience that and feel
that<00:01:51.630> even<00:01:52.409> being<00:01:52.590> anesthetized<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.759> gave<00:01:54.720> him

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that even being anesthetized I gave him

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.580 
that even being anesthetized I gave him
a<00:01:54.930> mental<00:01:55.259> block<00:01:55.440> by<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.409> see

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
a mental block by the way you can see

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
a mental block by the way you can see
how<00:01:58.740> pristine<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.399> canal<00:01:59.700> system<00:02:00.000> looks<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
how pristine the canal system looks just

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.340 
how pristine the canal system looks just
looking<00:02:01.289> down<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> microscope

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.469 

so<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.250> gonna<00:02:08.369> place<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> sodium

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so I'm gonna place the sodium

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.450 
so I'm gonna place the sodium
hypochlorite<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.100> tooth<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
hypochlorite in because this tooth is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.690 
hypochlorite in because this tooth is
non-vital<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.600> I'm<00:02:13.350> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.650> I'll<00:02:14.370> use<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
non-vital and I'm going to I'll use the

the<00:05:39.800> things<00:05:40.039> I<00:05:40.159> want<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:41.560> encourage<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.889> all

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
the things I want to encourage you all

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.619 
the things I want to encourage you all
to<00:05:43.099> think<00:05:43.370> about<00:05:43.639> is<00:05:44.000> you're<00:05:44.150> watching<00:05:44.330> this

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
to think about is you're watching this

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.740 
to think about is you're watching this
under<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> microscope<00:05:46.180> using<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.270> laser<00:05:47.479> with

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
under a microscope using a laser with

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.830 
under a microscope using a laser with
magnification<00:05:48.650> is<00:05:48.770> so<00:05:48.949> important<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.840> minimum

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
magnification is so important a minimum

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.290 
magnification is so important a minimum
of<00:05:50.960> four<00:05:51.199> point<00:05:51.530> five<00:05:51.740> X<00:05:52.129> magnification<00:05:52.340> is

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
of four point five X magnification is

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.990 
of four point five X magnification is
really<00:05:53.629> imperative<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:55.400> use<00:05:55.550> with<00:05:55.699> the<00:05:55.789> laser

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
really imperative to use with the laser

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.390 
really imperative to use with the laser
to<00:05:56.629> really<00:05:56.960> see<00:05:57.229> how<00:05:57.469> this<00:05:57.620> laser<00:05:58.009> is<00:05:58.159> so

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
to really see how this laser is so

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:06.080 
to really see how this laser is so
efficient

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.090 

I<00:06:06.120> like<00:06:06.750> to<00:06:06.870> think<00:06:07.050> in<00:06:07.200> terms<00:06:07.470> of<00:06:07.740> what<00:06:07.950> we're

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
I like to think in terms of what we're

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.430 
I like to think in terms of what we're
doing<00:06:08.220> here<00:06:08.610> is<00:06:08.700> micro<00:06:09.440> neurovascular

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
doing here is micro neurovascular

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.940 
doing here is micro neurovascular
surgery<00:06:12.470> so<00:06:13.470> why<00:06:13.620> shouldn't<00:06:13.889> we<00:06:14.160> we're<00:06:15.950> good

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
surgery so why shouldn't we we're good

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.830 
surgery so why shouldn't we we're good
