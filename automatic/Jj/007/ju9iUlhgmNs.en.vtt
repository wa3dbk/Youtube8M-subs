00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
after light also does that which is

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.829 
duco and I don't really use it that much
but<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.669> thought<00:05:48.879> it<00:05:49.000> was<00:05:49.089> pretty<00:05:49.240> cool<00:05:49.509> it's

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
but I thought it was pretty cool it's

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.420 
but I thought it was pretty cool it's
kind<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.139> like<00:05:50.289> the<00:05:50.469> photo<00:05:50.800> collage<00:05:51.099> thing

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
kind of like the photo collage thing

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.969 
kind of like the photo collage thing
except<00:05:51.879> it's<00:05:52.000> really<00:05:52.210> cool<00:05:52.509> shapes<00:05:52.870> so<00:05:53.770> if<00:05:53.860> I

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
except it's really cool shapes so if I

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.659 
except it's really cool shapes so if I
could<00:05:54.039> choose<00:05:54.279> like<00:05:54.580> a<00:05:55.539> circle<00:05:56.259> I<00:05:56.469> can<00:05:57.129> fill<00:05:57.550> it

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
could choose like a circle I can fill it

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.260 
could choose like a circle I can fill it
in<00:05:57.789> with<00:05:57.849> this<00:05:58.270> picture<00:05:58.779> and<00:05:58.960> then<00:05:59.919> use<00:06:00.370> and

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
in with this picture and then use and

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.450 
in with this picture and then use and
then<00:06:01.419> I<00:06:01.509> can<00:06:01.659> also<00:06:01.810> fill<00:06:02.259> the<00:06:02.439> background<00:06:02.680> so

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460
