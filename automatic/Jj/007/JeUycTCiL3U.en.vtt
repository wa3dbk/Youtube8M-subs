00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.859
 christian for karriere.de and today may 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.440
 I introduce you to a universal good 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.230
 that her ipad is even more productive and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.020
 useful if the old ipad 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 you certainly know the device 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.359
 Can do many functions of your laptop 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.090
 take over 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 however, it just can not work with everyone 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 bypass file types 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
 a shortcoming that fixes the good reader 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 Goodreader was one of the first 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.340
 programs in the ios app store on the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.610
 iphone and can relatively quickly 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 ipad here we have the good piece that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.680
 green symbol the only point of criticism in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.960
 this program 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 The surface has been the first 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.430
 version more or less unchanged 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.520
 that means simply watching 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.739
 Little I say stale and is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.050
 not up to date yet 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.989
 functionally, the program is one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.629
 definitely recommendation we have new items 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.359
 you open the program the first thing 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.500
 we see an overview of the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.960
 existing documents 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.810
 Here you can see already download ie 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.380
 The program is capable of file 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.689
 download 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 safari can not do that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.130
 unfortunately not chrome 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.869
 icap is now in the situation 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.070
 the right side have several 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.470
 different options 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.229
 up here could be a preview 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 see corresponding document 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 here they could according to appropriate 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.439
 search files 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 you see I have it not so many 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.549
 currently that's about to change 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.530
 can manage files that is called them 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.579
 Can this be a zip file 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 sum up 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.790
 You can send them by e-mail 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 Send a link and so share new 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.070
 folders create new text documents 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.290
 invest 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.119
 You can download files from the internet 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.720
 download how that works show 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.290
 I'll give you the same and you can files 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.700
 Over cloud services you see the selection 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.280
 here is very big it can be found from 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 imap server via mobileme that i will soon 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.140
 There are no more google docs 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.660
 dropbox sugarsync box net 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.450
 Serving your own webdav server ftp 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.630
 and other surfer types all sorts 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.090
 Options you coded here 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.709
 that could mean linking if they did 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.319
 a dropbox folder or similar 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.050
 you can have the direct members 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.570
 integrate and transfer the files directly into 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.910
 Goodwood invite a very pleasant 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.970
 the charge does not work many 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.250
 However, offering programs is the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.280
 Data transfer via wifi if here 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.810
 Click on neither a symbol 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.410
 you see it opens the sharing 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.150
 page i am with my macbook air that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.760
 you see them over here in the same 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.650
 wlan again good wheels 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.320
 we put the old something aside 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.720
 up here I have an IP address or 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.160
 a culture address to said we want 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.530
 of course, this address only works with 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.150
 a mac 's IP address comes with everyone 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.220
 so after i put the ip address 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.560
 I have entered the good more 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.480
 I have full access here 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.130
 all files on my boat back on 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.090
 the ipad 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.670
 I can also file here 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.380
 transfer or create new folders 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.810
 I will now all pdf 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.640
 this template is a 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 application template my colleague 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.420
 Christian Schropp on the career Bible 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.630
 above all other articles already 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.370
 used and put online 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.950
 I have selected these and say now 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.590
 uploads fall 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.989
 you see here has surfaced back 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.610
 on the ipad you can see the file we have 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.200
 have just transferred is yes too 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.829
 really arrived it is 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.140
 here at pdfs we have different 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.040
 Possibilities of editing you can 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.049
 of course here frame x develops parts 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.660
 insert texts or insert 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.860
 freehand drawing that is especially with 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.959
 a corresponding pen very much 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.459
 Practically because they can because easy 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.650
 select the freedom mode 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.299
 they can decide and up to this 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.820
 file should be saved or one 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.579
 copy should be created 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.780
 if they zoom in a little bit now 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.130
 can you do it here? 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.130
 Insert markings 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:23.650
 and leave comments that is 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.230
 always very convenient, I think if 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.210
 Do not use the ready-made texts or 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.220
 use the ready-made options 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.610
 but really want to do it by hand 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.960
 practically like a sheet of paper 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.520
 insert comments and notes 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 want 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.470
 I personally work with it a lot 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.090
 and i also know many coaches and 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.780
 educational work that is very successful 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.490
 use 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.830
 because it can be housework or 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.250
 other documents submitted as a pdf 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.630
 become 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.220
 wonderful note and edit if 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.140
 they are satisfied they say they are 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.850
 if not you can do it with others 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.320
 step back course you see 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.720
 here last steps disappear so 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.730
 what I wanted to show you and 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.140
 want to be back in file from the 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.070
 download internet 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.840
 to switch to chrome browser and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.420
 Choose another application template 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.530
 my colleague from here I copy myself 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.930
 the url go back to the code reader app 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.120
 downloads and say and url in this 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.870
 case had the copied url already 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.030
 accepted 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.900
 a click on ok start download the 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.760
 this is done 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.250
 you will find the document below 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.960
 downloads a click on it shows pdf 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.550
 downloaded 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.170
 by the way, they have different top ones 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.120
 tabs where you are between the different 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.990
 Switch documents open 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.850
 Here, for example, it was possible and that 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.800
 popular drink cafe the file 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.750
 But does not exist with a courier 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.430
 they have different ones 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.560
 ways you can adjust the screen 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.720
 rotation only ingrid for example outside 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.120
 turn on your lock symbol 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.380
 of course you can of course the bottom right 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.010
 split file 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.020
 If you like an antique file 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.620
 For example, this part became a map 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.110
 will have left comments before 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.200
 send if I asked the file like that 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.360
 would like to send as she is or if I want 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.550
 want to incorporate the comments 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.510
 That's a decision by 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.670
 can meet you 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.400
 they can always here 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.900
 Brightness of the screen govern what 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.840
 can be very practical if you have to 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.740
 do not call the multitasking bar 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.750
 want different possibilities of 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.080
 you can set pages to scroll 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.970
 You can turn the page like you 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.280
 I have just seen so 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.350
 practical side also to the right 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.300
 for example, turn backwards or backwards 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:51.010
 left and again, of course, too 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.500
 about the migrants open in dialogue 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.030
 files to other programs to pass 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.280
 that is not a problem 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.920
 only exception are videos here 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.200
 can not be directly into the 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.390
 transfer image and camera archive and 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.870
 unfortunately not directly in Imovie 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.150
 Open which of course would be the renewal 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.350
 apple is located primarily on apple 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.160
 these interfaces just do not work yet 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.350
 Approved 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.450
 Unfortunately that only makes the job 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.010
 something difficult alternative you can 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.930
 of course also files about the 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.110
 Swap displayed cloud services 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.970
 or via itunes and itunes 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.300
 calculator 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:30.060
 the view was a short list 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.040
 analyst files can be found in the article 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.070
 the link to the loans page and 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.420
 on the app store pages as well as we 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.620
 hope they liked it and we 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.600
 We'll be glad to see you next time 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.950
 Check back and give them this 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.970
 video a useful tips and 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.970
 could bring findings
