for about eight hours I random the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.320 
for about eight hours I random the
temperature<00:02:46.930> only<00:02:47.040> rose<00:02:48.040> one<00:02:48.430> degree<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.090> up

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330

to<00:02:49.450> 81<00:02:49.720> degrees<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.380> now<00:02:50.440> stoked<00:02:50.740> about<00:02:50.890> that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
to 81 degrees and now stoked about that

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.400 
to 81 degrees and now stoked about that
and<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.270> that's<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.630> what<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> legs<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.380> I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
and that that's just what the legs on I

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.680 
and that that's just what the legs on I
do<00:02:53.770> have<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> hanging<00:02:54.490> kit<00:02:54.700> coming<00:02:54.970> which<00:02:55.510> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
do have a hanging kit coming which it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.540 
do have a hanging kit coming which it
will<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.840> hanging<00:02:56.140> even<00:02:56.530> higher<00:02:56.740> than<00:02:56.770> this<00:02:57.190> so

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
will be hanging even higher than this so

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.640 
will be hanging even higher than this so
i<00:02:57.760> think<00:02:58.210> i'm<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.660> be<00:02:58.780> all<00:02:58.900> good<00:02:59.470> with

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.170 
i think i'm going to be all good with
the<00:02:59.740> temperature<00:03:00.190> parno<00:03:00.610> chillers<00:03:01.030> or

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180

the temperature parno chillers or
anything<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.960> make<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.320> fan

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
anything like that I make it a fan

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.240 
anything like that I make it a fan
anyway<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.520> blow<00:03:03.670> across<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.120> tank<00:03:05.250> but

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
anyway just to blow across the tank but

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.850 
anyway just to blow across the tank but
you<00:03:06.340> know<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.700> don't<00:03:07.120> need<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.230> we're<00:03:08.770> all

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
surface agitation only on this side

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.030 
surface agitation only on this side
there's<00:03:19.750> not<00:03:19.840> much<00:03:20.020> on<00:03:20.230> this<00:03:20.380> side<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:20.890> can
