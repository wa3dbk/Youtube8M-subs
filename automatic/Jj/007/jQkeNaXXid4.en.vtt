00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello youtube friends today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.160
 I bring a tutorial about how to record 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.310
 the screen of our device 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.930
 android with the recordable app with 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.390
 the one that I'm recording right now in 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.510
 grade with excellent quality and the 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.849
 we can download in the place tour and 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.739
 let's put recordable there is a version 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.339
 which is the free version that is this 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:25.050
 is here and this version that is paid this 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.179
 is the one that I have in the free version 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 the letters of the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:34.530
 application on the screen when they are 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 recording in this works very well in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 here I recommend that you buy it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 because it is a good application if you want 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.340
 upload tutorials to youtube gameplays or 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 what you need to record from your screen 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.589
 of your phone I recommend that the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.949
 Buy is very accessible to the public and 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.589
 good every time you go to record and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.309
 because you're not a device that 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.309
 count with ruth you understand that good there 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 you download it and it will appear 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.820
 you have to download an application to your 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.190
 computer 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.670
 when you install here as we can see 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.460
 this application here when you 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.520
 install here is recording me when you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.950
 installed the application is not going to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.250
 open and will look to record 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.440
 you have to download an application that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.540
 I'll leave the link in the description for 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.150
 that you download that is the activator 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.280
 both the free version and the version 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.340
 pay first that everything you have to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.700
 download the application to your phone and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.440
 download the application in the link that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.950
 I'll leave you in the description that is the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.590
 activator that's good once this is done 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 that you download you are going to execute in your 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.899
 computer the application that 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.940
 you downloaded something will happen to you 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 it tells you that you have to update something 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.729
 from your computer download some plugins 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.970
 of the next following then after 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.770
 when I tell you that you know your 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.360
 Android device you're going to make a 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.720
 Once there, it will come out of you 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.180
 is activated and then and so 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.920
 you can disconnect and you can record every 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 once you restart this device 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.000
 you will have to do the same to record 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.250
 since you do not have a device 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.200
 root so but good is very good at 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 the application and I hope you liked it
