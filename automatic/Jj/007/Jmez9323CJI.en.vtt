00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.119 

what's<00:00:07.839> going<00:00:08.080> on<00:00:08.200> guys<00:00:08.380> today<00:00:08.920> I<00:00:08.950> have

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
what's going on guys today I have

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.680 
what's going on guys today I have
another<00:00:09.280> quick<00:00:09.580> hackintosh<00:00:09.940> tip<00:00:10.299> right<00:00:10.539> and

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
another quick hackintosh tip right and

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.119 
another quick hackintosh tip right and
this<00:00:10.809> is<00:00:10.930> something<00:00:11.230> very<00:00:11.260> common<00:00:11.830> that

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
this is something very common that

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.070 
this is something very common that
people<00:00:12.430> run<00:00:12.549> into<00:00:12.610> all<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.120> time<00:00:13.510> and<00:00:13.750> that's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
people run into all the time and that's

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.449 
people run into all the time and that's
when<00:00:14.230> they<00:00:14.320> go<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.500> install<00:00:14.799> OS<00:00:14.980> 10<00:00:15.100> on<00:00:15.340> their

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
when they go to install OS 10 on their

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.310 
when they go to install OS 10 on their
hard<00:00:15.670> drive<00:00:15.910> granted<00:00:16.390> I<00:00:16.480> said<00:00:16.660> hard<00:00:16.869> drive<00:00:17.109> not

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
hard drive granted I said hard drive not

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.109 
hard drive granted I said hard drive not
solid-state<00:00:17.770> drive<00:00:18.010> and<00:00:18.189> for<00:00:18.580> some<00:00:18.760> reason

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
solid-state drive and for some reason

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.120 
solid-state drive and for some reason
even<00:00:19.270> after<00:00:19.900> they<00:00:20.020> run<00:00:20.199> multibeast<00:00:20.830> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
even after they run multibeast and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.800 
even after they run multibeast and
install<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:21.580> chimera<00:00:21.970> bootloader<00:00:22.390> they

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
install the chimera bootloader they

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.870 
install the chimera bootloader they
still<00:00:23.260> cannot<00:00:23.620> get<00:00:23.770> it<00:00:23.920> to<00:00:24.070> boot<00:00:24.280> and<00:00:24.430> that's

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
still cannot get it to boot and that's

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.940 
still cannot get it to boot and that's
because<00:00:25.180> their<00:00:25.390> drive<00:00:25.630> has<00:00:25.810> four<00:00:26.140> K<00:00:26.440> sectors

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
because their drive has four K sectors

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.100 
because their drive has four K sectors
and<00:00:27.220> really<00:00:27.730> quick<00:00:27.910> just<00:00:28.119> what<00:00:28.240> that<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.600> you

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
and really quick just what that is you

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.510 
and really quick just what that is you
know<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.260> couple<00:00:29.500> years<00:00:29.619> ago<00:00:29.890> back<00:00:30.220> when<00:00:30.280> we

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
know a couple years ago back when we

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.060 
know a couple years ago back when we
didn't<00:00:30.789> have<00:00:30.880> these<00:00:31.090> huge<00:00:31.420> 1<00:00:31.779> 2<00:00:32.169> 3<00:00:32.529> terabyte

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
didn't have these huge 1 2 3 terabyte

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.950 
didn't have these huge 1 2 3 terabyte
drives<00:00:33.370> all<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.149> drives<00:00:34.390> are<00:00:34.570> broken<00:00:34.840> down

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
drives all the drives are broken down

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.069 
drives all the drives are broken down
into<00:00:35.109> 512<00:00:35.980> byte<00:00:36.550> sectors<00:00:37.059> but<00:00:37.750> ever<00:00:37.930> since

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
into 512 byte sectors but ever since

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.300 
into 512 byte sectors but ever since
they<00:00:38.230> started<00:00:38.410> making<00:00:38.770> these<00:00:38.860> high-capacity

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
they started making these high-capacity

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.580 
they started making these high-capacity
drives<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.060> know<00:00:40.180> 500<00:00:40.690> gig<00:00:40.840> one<00:00:41.110> terabyte<00:00:41.560> and

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
drives you know 500 gig one terabyte and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.799 
drives you know 500 gig one terabyte and
etc<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.370> on<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.610> so<00:00:42.730> forth<00:00:43.000> they<00:00:43.510> actually

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
etc and so on and so forth they actually

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.330 
etc and so on and so forth they actually
had<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:43.989> make<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.380> sector's<00:00:44.710> bigger<00:00:45.040> and

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
had to make the sector's bigger and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.200 
had to make the sector's bigger and
they're<00:00:45.489> now<00:00:46.050> 4096<00:00:47.050> bytes<00:00:47.230> or<00:00:47.500> 4k<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.460> that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
they're now 4096 bytes or 4k and that

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.000 
they're now 4096 bytes or 4k and that
causes<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.840> problem<00:00:50.079> with<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.500> chimera

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
causes a problem with the chimera

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.740 
causes a problem with the chimera
bootloader<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:51.610> so<00:00:52.090> I've<00:00:52.270> seen<00:00:52.450> this<00:00:52.600> on

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
bootloader and so I've seen this on

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.319 
bootloader and so I've seen this on
drives<00:00:53.110> as<00:00:53.350> low<00:00:53.559> as<00:00:53.770> 500<00:00:54.520> gigabytes<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.149> I've

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
drives as low as 500 gigabytes and I've

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.270 
drives as low as 500 gigabytes and I've
actually<00:00:55.540> shown<00:00:55.930> you<00:00:56.200> guys<00:00:56.350> today<00:00:56.590> but<00:00:57.129> for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
actually shown you guys today but for

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.619 
actually shown you guys today but for
example<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.640> have<00:00:57.730> another<00:00:57.910> Drive<00:00:58.210> here<00:00:58.420> that's

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
example I have another Drive here that's

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.290 
example I have another Drive here that's
one<00:00:58.840> terabyte<00:00:59.410> and<00:00:59.559> this<00:01:00.190> also<00:01:00.430> has<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.940> 4k

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
one terabyte and this also has the 4k

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.540 
one terabyte and this also has the 4k
sectors<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:01.899> granted<00:01:02.440> there<00:01:02.620> are<00:01:02.800> a<00:01:02.829> few<00:01:03.250> hard

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
sectors and granted there are a few hard

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.179 
sectors and granted there are a few hard
drives<00:01:03.850> out<00:01:04.030> there<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.719> no<00:01:05.049> are<00:01:05.199> 500<00:01:05.770> gigs<00:01:06.009> I

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
drives out there that no are 500 gigs I

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.859 
drives out there that no are 500 gigs I
don't<00:01:06.460> think<00:01:06.640> there's<00:01:06.759> any<00:01:06.909> one<00:01:07.450> terabyte

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
don't think there's any one terabyte

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.300 
don't think there's any one terabyte
drives<00:01:08.049> I<00:01:08.200> could<00:01:08.500> be<00:01:08.619> wrong<00:01:08.740> about<00:01:08.799> that<00:01:09.130> those

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
drives I could be wrong about that those

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.190 
drives I could be wrong about that those

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
few drives that do not have the 4k

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.630 
few drives that do not have the 4k
sectors<00:01:13.720> yet<00:01:14.320> now<00:01:14.799> this<00:01:15.159> you're<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.580> to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
sectors yet now this you're going to

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.980 
sectors yet now this you're going to
find<00:01:15.850> those<00:01:15.940> on<00:01:16.119> pretty<00:01:16.330> much<00:01:16.420> every<00:01:16.780> single

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
find those on pretty much every single

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.140 
find those on pretty much every single
Drive<00:01:17.320> that's<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:17.770> one<00:01:18.220> terabyte<00:01:18.640> or<00:01:18.820> greater

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
Drive that's of one terabyte or greater

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.640 
Drive that's of one terabyte or greater
and<00:01:19.420> pretty<00:01:19.960> soon<00:01:20.110> they're<00:01:20.290> going<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.470> be<00:01:20.560> on

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.170 
and pretty soon they're going to be on
all<00:01:20.830> drives<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.549> said<00:01:21.729> I'm<00:01:21.880> going<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.119> be

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
all drives like I said I'm going to be

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.609 
all drives like I said I'm going to be
showing<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.479> guys<00:01:22.540> on<00:01:22.869> a<00:01:22.960> drive<00:01:23.170> today<00:01:23.380> that's

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
showing you guys on a drive today that's

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.340 
showing you guys on a drive today that's
500<00:01:24.250> gigabytes<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.820> has<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.450> 4k<00:01:25.810> sector<00:01:26.140> so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
500 gigabytes and has the 4k sector so

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.410 
500 gigabytes and has the 4k sector so
pretty<00:01:26.590> soon<00:01:26.799> these<00:01:27.280> 4k<00:01:27.760> sectors<00:01:28.119> are<00:01:28.299> going

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
pretty soon these 4k sectors are going

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.300 
pretty soon these 4k sectors are going
to<00:01:28.510> be<00:01:28.570> taking<00:01:28.900> over<00:01:29.140> every<00:01:29.500> single<00:01:29.740> Drive<00:01:30.100> out

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
to be taking over every single Drive out

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.950 
to be taking over every single Drive out
there<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:30.970> give<00:01:31.210> them<00:01:31.299> while<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.570> can<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
there so give them while you can the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.719 
there so give them while you can the
ones<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.260> aren't<00:01:32.439> 4k<00:01:32.890> but<00:01:33.369> that's<00:01:33.610> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729
