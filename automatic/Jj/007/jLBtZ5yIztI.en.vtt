00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.670
 hello this is the trekstor surfing tab 7 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.990
 and yes, we are looking at the sides of the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.609
 are kept very close bare 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 all three pages except for the top 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.460
 are held long now we come 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 just to the surface top here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.270
 it once the power button next to it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.059
 the jack next to the micro usb 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 port the charging port and then the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.670
 sd-card slot now we drive the device 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.350
 once up and yes i can do a bit 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 what to tell about the device and that is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.670
 It's seven inches tall with a resolution 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 of 800 x 480 pixeln that is 133 pp 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 and the battery is 2900 milliamps strong 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 it has android 4.0 ice cream sandwich 1 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.950
 1 2 ghz processor and 512 megabyte ram 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 you have to say that he does that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.610
 processor still single core core is so 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.479
 not so choir so only one core has 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.369
 so now we have the device 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.450
 started up and we'll see you soon 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.220
 time the surface 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.270
 that's just android 4.0 like me 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 have said and sick after on 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 boot up is noticed that the device is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.659
 yes still very hard and everything else 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 a bit jerky is what we see 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.640
 Now here for example if we have one 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 little bit back and forth 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.900
 and yes we can do the same here 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 adjust volume that is synonymous 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.530
 we do not have to go all the way up 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.909
 somehow use the train but 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.659
 can do the same on the screen 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.420
 make and also the option button is 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.430
 also integrated with the screen 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 in the settings we see that it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.700
 just the same possibilities 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.729
 Like any Android device you can 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.979
 set everything here which is specific 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.119
 for android is needed so here now 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.469
 one can again see that what I 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630
 just mentioned that's just one 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.480
 little 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.580
 not quite liquid but the tablet 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.660
 currently costs only 60 euros synonymous 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 so you can not complain much 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.490
 and also drawer looks in the app here 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.590
 you speak like me performance 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.560
 However, this is only the first time 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.290
 start the case if we have something now 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.080
 it will wait much more fluidly 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.810
 So look who is patient 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.970
 He is satisfied with that, too 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.760
 Of course, the place gate offers many 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.920
 ways to find good apps and yes 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.620
 also on this huge variety in the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.690
 Play stop before trade is accessible 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.690
 I have the app from this variety 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.030
 tempera two I'll choose you 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 Show wants to see if you can 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.930
 because at all with this tablet too 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.710
 games can play because of the hardware 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.940
 Of course it is relatively bad 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.770
 but only relative if you are in the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.900
 It is quite good in relation to the price 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.060
 that's why we can see that now 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.160
 now here at temperatures 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.310
 needed to load longer and the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.970
 This looks pretty smooth 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.950
 and like my game 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.670
 now throw update was requested by 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.680
 do not irritate 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.200
 so and now it starts and sees 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.000
 everything is very fluid so far from it 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.520
 definitely to use and also 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.490
 Here the interaction is good 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.709
 the touchscreen has yes or that or that 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.950
 touchscreen always playing currently 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.140
 say who has a multitouch of 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.330
 therefore you can play many games like me here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.500
 play along because many cheap tablets it 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.310
 is not that multi anymore 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.030
 but this tablet has touch 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.000
 for this 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.250
 So this game is synonymous right 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.120
 liquid so I have now so far 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.120
 no jerks seen here 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.440
 and yes, that's the main thing 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.870
 So a tablet you also one 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.609
 little thing can play so now 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.209
 I want to show you the sound once 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.209
 for this 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.420
 Yes 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.910
 Yes 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.160
 so that was the sound and besides that can 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.450
 tablet of course also as an ebook 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.610
 use again and that's what I think 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.710
 one of the best features of this because 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.190
 you do not need a good one like me 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.650
 hardware and now we still do it 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.270
 once the angle test I turn 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.400
 The tablet I just look and you look 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.380
 you look at the display angles so 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.590
 that is not so outstanding right now 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.180
 you can also really do not get much 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.920
 expect 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.250
 In summary, that can say that 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.160
 trekstor is definitely a good surfing experience 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.260
 entry into the tablet world is and you 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.930
 In any case, if you have that 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.360
 the first device used in any case 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.110
 This tablet is good 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.710
 can use 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.060
 besides, it is also good as a two tablet 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.890
 for example as an ebook reader too 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.750
 use that works like me 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.470
 very good or just on the internet too 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.040
 surfing 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.390
 Of course it's relative for games 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.010
 badly usable because then not the 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.340
 all games are watched 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.510
 tempodrom went well but then 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.520
 more difficult or graphically elaborate 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.500
 Games will not be on this one anymore 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.000
 tablet should be running so should play 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.250
 you do not buy this tablet there 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.390
 you should then get a higher quality 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.120
 buy a device 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:13.500
 yes, and therefore this is indeed usb 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.620
 connection has this device yes over the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.260
 Micro-USB connection is indeed in the 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.130
 Packing 1 cable 1 adapter when on the 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.470
 with which one then quite normal usb 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.840
 stick to the device may connect 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.280
 It of course also very good in use 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.130
 this device just happens in between 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.810
 somehow from his usb stick 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.640
 to retrieve any data only 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.470
 this is also very good or 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.330
 to send data back and forth from one 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.570
 usb-stick on the other that runs 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.010
 of course here with the four gigabytes 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.130
 storage space can be stabilized 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.480
 this of course done well yes me 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.450
 I hope I could give you this video 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.470
 should help that should not like me 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.240
 Detailed test should be easy 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.440
 just so that gets a bit 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.150
 imagine and a little bit the 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.910
 show possibilities 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.740
 it should not be a real test 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.420
 so hopefully it will still be yours 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.890
 please feel free to give me feedback 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.670
 give and take a look at new ones 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.620
 channel over 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.820
 that would be very supportive to me 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.820
 next time bye
