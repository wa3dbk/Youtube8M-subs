00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
can see that we have a digital database

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
can see that we have a digital database
loading<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> background<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> moves<00:01:12.810> to

loading in the background and moves to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
loading in the background and moves to
the<00:01:13.140> next<00:01:13.170> slide<00:01:13.560> over<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the next slide over and then you have a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
the next slide over and then you have a
group<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.810> images<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> play<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:18.270> goal<00:01:18.480> is

group of images that play the goal is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.900 
group of images that play the goal is
during<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:20.150> position<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.380> 11.9<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:23.370> have<00:01:23.730> it

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
during the position that 11.9 to have it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.500 
during the position that 11.9 to have it
so<00:01:24.120> our<00:01:24.420> actual<00:01:25.520> photograph<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:26.820> portrait<00:01:27.360> is

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
created a simple dark box this is just

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.480 
created a simple dark box this is just
so<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.680> something<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.280> background

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
so we have something in the background

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.030 
so we have something in the background
that's<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.720> guarantee<00:02:26.959> no<00:02:27.739> white

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
that's going to guarantee no white

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.390 
that's going to guarantee no white
background<00:02:28.580> showing<00:02:28.820> up<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.920> next<00:02:31.130> thing<00:02:31.340> I'm

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
background showing up the next thing I'm

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.030 
background showing up the next thing I'm
going<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.670> add<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.150> our<00:02:32.510> portrait<00:02:35.830> alright<00:02:36.830> so

now we have these two items we're now
going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.160> group<00:02:40.550> them<00:02:40.850> by<00:02:40.880> going<00:02:41.630> to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
going to group them by going to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.620 
going to group them by going to
right-click<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.750> group<00:02:46.300> next<00:02:47.300> we're<00:02:47.480> going

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
right-click and group next we're going

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.350 
right-click and group next we're going
to<00:02:47.780> animate<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:48.860> image<00:02:49.280> now<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.150> all

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
to animate this image now this is all

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.030 
to animate this image now this is all
happening<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> single<00:02:51.350> image<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:51.860> don't

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
happening as a single image we don't

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.650 
happening as a single image we don't
have<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.250> worry<00:02:52.370> about<00:02:52.489> animating<00:02:53.120> each<00:02:53.300> item

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
have to worry about animating each item

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.920 
have to worry about animating each item
separately<00:02:55.239> we're<00:02:56.239> going<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.600> use<00:02:56.750> an

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
separately we're going to use an

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.949 
separately we're going to use an
animation<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.800> it's<00:02:58.760> called<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.390> dissolve

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
animation and it's called the dissolve

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.660 
animation and it's called the dissolve
effect

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.640 

alright<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:05.690> we're<00:03:05.780> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.020> go<00:03:06.140> ahead<00:03:06.200> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
alright so we're going to go ahead and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.650 
alright so we're going to go ahead and
use<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:06.950> if<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.580> click<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:07.940> preview<00:03:08.270> you'll

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
use that if you click on preview you'll

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.620 
use that if you click on preview you'll
be<00:03:08.840> able<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.140> see<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.819> animation<00:03:10.819> itself<00:03:11.120> come

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
be able to see the animation itself come

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.350 
be able to see the animation itself come
in<00:03:14.860> next<00:03:15.860> up<00:03:16.190> we<00:03:16.459> are<00:03:16.520> going<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.940> have<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
in next up we are going to have the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.330 
in next up we are going to have the
animation<00:03:17.840> set<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.380> play<00:03:18.920> at<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:19.099> certain

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
animation set to play at a certain

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.540 
animation set to play at a certain
bookmark<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:21.230> we<00:03:21.440> need<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.709> insert<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.100> bookmark

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
bookmark so we need to insert a bookmark

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.890 
bookmark so we need to insert a bookmark
again<00:03:22.940> we're<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.420> be<00:03:23.510> using<00:03:23.660> that

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
again we're going to be using that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.240 
again we're going to be using that
roughly<00:03:24.380> 11.9<00:03:25.340> position<00:03:26.560> go<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.620> video<00:03:27.890> tools

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
roughly 11.9 position go to video tools

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.140 
roughly 11.9 position go to video tools
playback<00:03:29.209> add<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.600> bookmark<00:03:30.519> now<00:03:31.519> at<00:03:31.819> this

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
playback add a bookmark now at this

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.360 
playback add a bookmark now at this
point<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:32.840> want<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.590> items<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.099> start

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
point we want the items to start

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.070 
point we want the items to start
dissolving<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.390> we're<00:03:35.510> going<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.750> open<00:03:35.870> up

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
dissolving in so we're going to open up

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.500 
dissolving in so we're going to open up
the<00:03:36.230> animation<00:03:36.620> pane<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:40.390> for<00:03:41.390> their

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the animation pane and for their

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.330 
the animation pane and for their
entrance<00:03:41.900> we're<00:03:42.140> going<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.470> select<00:03:42.680> trigger

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
entrance we're going to select trigger

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.900 
entrance we're going to select trigger
on<00:03:44.049> bookmark<00:03:45.049> one<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.190> means<00:03:46.400> once<00:03:46.670> this

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
on bookmark one so that means once this

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.850 
on bookmark one so that means once this
bookmark<00:03:47.209> starts<00:03:47.870> we're<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.799> able

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
bookmark starts we're going to be able

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.979 
bookmark starts we're going to be able
to<00:03:49.040> have<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.670> items<00:03:50.060> start<00:03:50.330> coming<00:03:50.600> into<00:03:50.720> play

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.309 

let's<00:03:53.989> go<00:03:54.230> ahead<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.560> preview<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:56.319> again

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
let's go ahead and preview that again

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.600 
let's go ahead and preview that again
it's<00:03:57.500> going<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.799> wait<00:03:57.920> until<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.280> gets<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.519> that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
it's going to wait until it gets to that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.940 
it's going to wait until it gets to that
particular<00:03:58.880> bookmark<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.170> we'll<00:04:00.769> have

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
particular bookmark so we'll have

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.460 
particular bookmark so we'll have
roughly<00:04:01.190> 11<00:04:01.850> seconds<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.989> actual

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
roughly 11 seconds of the actual

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.199 
roughly 11 seconds of the actual
animation<00:04:03.920> playing<00:04:04.370> through<00:04:04.700> before<00:04:04.940> our

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
animation playing through before our

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.420 
animation playing through before our
picture<00:04:05.600> comes<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:08.739> next<00:04:09.739> up<00:04:10.040> we're<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.310> to

ahead and reduce the size of just a

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.730 
ahead and reduce the size of just a
little<00:04:36.680> bit<00:04:36.830> here

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.200

start showing up right about here we're
going<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:37.990> go<00:05:38.050> ahead<00:05:38.080> now<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.440> add<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.890> trigger

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
going to go ahead now and add a trigger

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.750 
going to go ahead now and add a trigger
and<00:05:40.140> that's<00:05:41.140> going<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.560> be<00:05:41.710> on<00:05:41.980> bookmark

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
and that's going to be on bookmark

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760 
and that's going to be on bookmark
number<00:05:43.030> two<00:05:43.270> so<00:05:43.660> let's<00:05:43.690> go<00:05:43.870> ahead<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.200> add<00:05:44.440> our

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
number two so let's go ahead and add our

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.750 
number two so let's go ahead and add our
second<00:05:45.340> bookmark<00:05:47.070> in<00:05:48.510> this<00:05:49.510> text<00:05:49.930> box<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
second bookmark in this text box the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.860 
second bookmark in this text box the
animation<00:05:51.760> is<00:05:51.880> on<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.090> right<00:05:52.300> so<00:05:52.600> let's<00:05:52.720> go

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
animation is on the right so let's go

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.840 
animation is on the right so let's go
ahead<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.170> get<00:05:53.530> that<00:05:53.590> trigger<00:05:53.950> applied<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
ahead and get that trigger applied and

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.200 
ahead and get that trigger applied and
preview<00:05:57.850> that<00:05:57.970> again<00:05:59.400> so<00:06:00.400> now<00:06:00.580> we<00:06:00.640> should<00:06:00.970> have

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
preview that again so now we should have

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.870 
preview that again so now we should have
the<00:06:01.420> database<00:06:01.840> load<00:06:02.170> will<00:06:03.010> have<00:06:03.220> all<00:06:03.550> of<00:06:03.580> the

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
the database load will have all of the

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.560 
the database load will have all of the
images<00:06:04.180> scan<00:06:05.050> through<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:06.000> then<00:06:07.000> about<00:06:07.360> at

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
images scan through and then about at

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.090 
images scan through and then about at
the<00:06:07.720> same<00:06:07.930> time<00:06:08.140> we're<00:06:08.350> going<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.650> have<00:06:08.800> our

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
the same time we're going to have our

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.980 
the same time we're going to have our
image<00:06:09.430> show<00:06:09.640> up<00:06:09.930> followed<00:06:10.930> by<00:06:10.960> the<00:06:11.740> text<00:06:12.990> now

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
image show up followed by the text now

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.420 
image show up followed by the text now
if<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.230> notice<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:14.650> text<00:06:14.980> came<00:06:15.130> in<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.310> little

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
if you notice the text came in a little

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.580 
if you notice the text came in a little
bit<00:06:15.760> on<00:06:15.850> the<00:06:15.970> slow<00:06:16.240> side<00:06:16.270> so<00:06:17.110> what<00:06:17.290> we're<00:06:17.440> going

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
bit on the slow side so what we're going

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.590 
bit on the slow side so what we're going
to<00:06:17.710> do<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.100> reduce<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:19.000> amount<00:06:19.150> of<00:06:19.300> time<00:06:19.570> that

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
to do is reduce the amount of time that

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.570 
to do is reduce the amount of time that
we<00:06:19.870> have<00:06:20.080> between<00:06:20.350> each<00:06:20.710> individual<00:06:21.340> letter

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
we have between each individual letter

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.940 
we have between each individual letter
there<00:06:22.390> is<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.600> certain<00:06:22.990> amount<00:06:23.140> of<00:06:23.350> trial<00:06:23.770> and

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
there is a certain amount of trial and

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.610 
there is a certain amount of trial and
error<00:06:24.100> for<00:06:24.490> this<00:06:24.840> so<00:06:25.840> just<00:06:25.990> play<00:06:26.230> around<00:06:26.350> with

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
error for this so just play around with

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.780 
error for this so just play around with
it<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:26.800> find<00:06:27.040> something<00:06:27.340> that<00:06:27.460> works<00:06:27.580> really

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
it and find something that works really

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.590 
it and find something that works really
well<00:06:27.910> for<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:29.340> we're<00:06:30.340> also<00:06:30.460> going<00:06:30.790> to<00:06:30.910> extend

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
well for you we're also going to extend

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.140 
well for you we're also going to extend
the<00:06:31.810> delay<00:06:32.170> on<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:33.490> picture<00:06:33.880> coming<00:06:34.120> in<00:06:35.070> and

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
the delay on the picture coming in and

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.850 
the delay on the picture coming in and
now<00:06:37.150> let's<00:06:37.360> go<00:06:37.600> ahead<00:06:37.690> and<00:06:37.870> play<00:06:38.320> the<00:06:38.500> actual

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
now let's go ahead and play the actual

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.590 
now let's go ahead and play the actual
slideshow<00:06:39.400> so<00:06:39.610> you<00:06:39.730> can<00:06:39.880> see<00:06:40.090> how<00:06:40.330> it<00:06:40.360> would

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
slideshow so you can see how it would

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.330 
slideshow so you can see how it would
look<00:06:41.080> in<00:06:41.500> reality<00:06:43.530> so<00:06:44.530> we<00:06:44.680> have<00:06:44.800> our<00:06:44.830> database

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
look in reality so we have our database

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.740 
look in reality so we have our database
coming<00:06:45.610> in

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
coming in

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.100 
coming in
and<00:06:47.680> now<00:06:48.580> we'll<00:06:48.760> wait<00:06:48.910> as<00:06:49.060> it<00:06:49.210> shifts<00:06:49.420> over<00:06:49.900> we

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
and now we'll wait as it shifts over we
