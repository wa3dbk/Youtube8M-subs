00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.629
 we come to this world with our eyes 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.049
 closed and most decide to live their 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.230
 life in the same way 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.390
 we blindly follow who leads us 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.970
 we always give ourselves to anything 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.740
 to provide us with a motivation to us 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.230
 let's discover nothing new if we talk 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.820
 of call of duty wear began its 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.829
 reigned almost unintentionally thanks to a 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.360
 referring to modern warfare and from there 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.590
 henceforth he had his more and his 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 less point by removing and putting 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.100
 options without giving at any time with 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 the key but keeping that formula 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.750
 that has catapulted you to success 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.300
 gost last year's delivery evidenced 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.460
 a clear decline was a tasteless game 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.199
 without personality that was also launched in 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.760
 full console transition and that 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.680
 got that even the most players 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.739
 faithful ar who will do the eyebrow as a sign of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.449
 dissatisfaction but comes 2014 with the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.550
 new consoles already seated and with 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.710
 sledgehammer to the rescue company 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.900
 responsible for this advanced worth the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.790
 premise back to the genesis of the saga 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.659
 where duels are won by shooting with 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.490
 your rifle 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.680
 plus the clear addition is of the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.729
 exoskeletons the technology that marks the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 development of this new delivery 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.190
 as is usual with the iut and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.140
 divided into three sections campaign 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.610
 multiplayer and cooperative 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.650
 focusing all its potential on the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.570
 second with this new installment no 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.580
 they turn the tables but if you have wanted 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.350
 take good care of the campaign mode by giving it 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.850
 a consistent story rhythm in addition to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.490
 file a luxury claim as it is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.440
 kevin spacey well I like it is a great 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.300
 soldier the story revolves around the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.250
 soldier michelle who sees as after 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.840
 a series of circumstances ends almost 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.570
 by obligation working to give them 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.700
 a directed technological megacorporation 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.330
 by jonathan irons role he plays 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.840
 the good of space well done son 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.120
 welcome back 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.890
 we forget the complications and the twists 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.990
 absurdities and we focus on a script 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.210
 coherent where effectively as prays 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.500
 the slogan the power changes everything and 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.390
 where technology has reached such 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.679
 point that wars have nothing that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.719
 see what we know 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.159
 but talking about playable mechanics 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.689
 we must emphasize for good the great 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.969
 variety of title and for evil 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 unfortunately they are box 2 that are 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.689
 his shootings 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.230
 we loved for example the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.819
 ability of the exoskeleton to 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.739
 show us new skills in each 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.230
 chapter we can become invisible 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.780
 jump higher and even throw a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.040
 hook to reach high places 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.659
 these characteristics are fine 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.250
 related but in most 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.829
 we will use them to overcome 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.659
 totally corseted phases of all 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.670
 ways still weary for the same 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.750
 shootings and animations of always the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.459
 appearance of a character so 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 charismatic as irons and the good rhythm 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.000
 of the adventure they have managed to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.239
 let's finish the campaign with a great taste of 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.239
 mouth 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.340
 in the multiplayer we find the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.840
 better decisions without any doubt the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.299
 inclusion of the exoskeleton gives you a 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.459
 new dimension to a game exhausted no longer 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.080
 only the new way of moving adds a 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.000
 Frantic vertical component that 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.950
 feel fable but now not 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.290
 we will fall from a shot as it happened in 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.090
 ghosts we can rectify after being 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.940
 injured and the strength of the graphic engine 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.049
 makes everything feel more whole without 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.049
 errors in the impacts 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.710
 returns the system fit of black ops 2 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.630
 increasing the compartments up to 13 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.790
 we can create classes to our liking 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.650
 spending the tickets in loading our 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.680
 weapons or on the contrary allocating 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.300
 our potential to the low gusts 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.070
 the latter are not so destructive 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.450
 as on other occasions besides being 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.450
 more complicated to unlock 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.950
 apart from accessories like grenades 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.720
 we have sex about 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.310
 armor enhancers that we 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.650
 allow options such as deploying a 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.819
 shield make us invisible by receiving 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.819
 a temporary health rush 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.670
 we will also discover packages of 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.410
 supplies with temporary enhancers 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.650
 that add a random component 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.000
 very grateful and do not fear because everything 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.500
 has been balanced so that it does not exist 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.690
 no combination above another 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.820
 in terms of maps and game modes the 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.410
 first are counted up to 13 and are one 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.980
 ideal design for the new way of 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.980
 move 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.790
 new modes were added as a link 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.500
 a kind of futuristic handball where 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.690
 we must score the ball on a base 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.700
 we also have the fun 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.590
 initiative that twists the concept of 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.290
 hot spot other modes already 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.610
 existing though not sledgehammer it 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.800
 have focused on letting the player 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.330
 customize everything to your liking either from 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.700
 the soldier's appearance until the streaks 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.139
 low that can be enhanced we 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.030
 we feel in no time that is 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.280
 decompensated that is too complex 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.810
 for the player everything flows like silk 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.310
 and on the battlefield at last and 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.050
 What is important is the ability of 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.030
 player without there being a couple of planes 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.150
 out there doing the dirty work 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.150
 do not 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.379
 and we have left to finish the cooperative 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.349
 that links directly with the 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.270
 multiplayer in these missions we must 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.430
 defeat hordes of enemies that we 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.069
 improvement will award points to redeem 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.839
 for weapons or costume enhancers not 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.759
 they have as much depth or charisma as 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.289
 Zombies Treyarch but a good 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.240
 added for people who want to play 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.670
 online with friends and you do not see it very 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.650
 well compete against other humans 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.050
 we can not forget the section 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.240
 technical is for the first time a call of 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.860
 duty designed for the new generation and 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.960
 although it receives some other elements 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.120
 deliveries have precious moments 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.040
 but here feel the 23 guardian 5 ha 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.990
 fallen and you talk has the charge we're going to 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.790
 intercept them mostly has improved to 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.220
 level of lighting and modeling has already 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.020
 gained a lot of solidity running at 1080p and 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.020
 60 frames per second like a rock 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.150
 come on let's know very well how 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.920
 impress the player in scenes of 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.220
 great visual invoice where also 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.330
 we must highlight the sequences of ge 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.310
 lately we are not used to 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:29.180
 but if they come back with this quality 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.180
 welcome are the toys 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.790
 the dubbing however we thought 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.620
 something discreet especially for some 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.720
 Characters like gold too 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.080
 shrill and lip syncing is 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.080
 very improvable 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.330
 that everyone moves away from the window 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.910
 this is compensated anyway 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.380
 for a very strong fx and a good 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.800
 soundtrack by harry 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.800
 gregson-williams 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.840
 In short, we are facing a call of 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.360
 duty that repeats the formula yes but 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.770
 evolves in the right direction 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.810
 sledgehammer has known how to take care 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.240
 same a fun campaign mode and has 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.380
 returned to multiplayer to its roots 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.880
 adding with much style 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.990
 some exoskeletons that improve 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.729
 Mechanics of the title without losing 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.069
 identity 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.870
 it is not perfect by any means and it follows 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.849
 falling into errors and obsolete concepts 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.860
 for some but at least it takes the 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.749
 good way and that guarantees us a year 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.039
 where the phrase of one more game and what 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.039
 He left back to be present
