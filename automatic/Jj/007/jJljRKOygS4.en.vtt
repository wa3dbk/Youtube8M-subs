00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.720
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.130
 from me 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 I want you back ten today 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.260
 Introducing compatible 17 winter botoms 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.740
 and I think I'm starting right now 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.740
 this video 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.869
 look at the first team once 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.970
 namely 7 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.369
 this is available for free in cydia 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.259
 and we see some adjustments here 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.520
 of the different apps so here now 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.620
 on the first page was actually 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.720
 Everything adjusted so far now 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.730
 worried my navigation app but even 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.150
 Pedalo and safari have one here 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.800
 update gets on facebook and unfortunately 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.690
 not the weather app again but that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.100
 That's because I have the live version 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.750
 have installed 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.820
 otherwise if I am in the folder 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.739
 We see a well here, too 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.909
 Great customization and looks at everyone 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.850
 case is actually pretty cool 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.519
 very colorful and similar to 17 very 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.589
 getting used to at the beginning as 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.690
 but next I want to show you 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.280
 this team costs two dollars in cydia 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.220
 and we see a very round one here 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 design the individual icons are something 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.580
 round and also smaller but 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.170
 Here, too, almost everything was actually 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.610
 others fit here for example the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.710
 navigation app again but not 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840
 otherwise everyone else will be here 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.400
 apps also support in my extras 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.510
 she'll fix that very much for you 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.480
 is also supported here, for example 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.340
 Spotify then the stock app would be one 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.230
 customization and all apps now 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.660
 specifically were not adapted 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.450
 simply made smaller and down 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.110
 next with you guys after os 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.380
 imagine 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.810
 this team costs 299 and there is something 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.140
 completely different something we already know from 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.030
 For example, 16 and 15 edges and looks 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.190
 very strange at first glance 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.930
 here too , for example, or occurs 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.730
 the facebook app but overall 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.230
 actually a very nice team 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.180
 I personally like it very much too 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.860
 now find the phone app for example 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.409
 I pretty cool off the videos app 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.510
 also or the music app and 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.040
 also here was very much different so 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.320
 you see here was actually everything 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.450
 fit and all the other apps now 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.190
 were not specifically supported 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.709
 a little smaller so overall we have 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.720
 and a slightly smaller design but this 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.659
 actually looks pretty cool like that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.819
 you'll see us flat eight times 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.069
 something completely different though a round one 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.129
 design but also a very simple one 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.900
 have all the apps around here adapted and 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.250
 some just completely supported 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.110
 have had an extra here 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.790
 get a circle like for example in the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.790
 phone app to watch or video 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.920
 sap and tweak bird in this 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.379
 was just rounded here and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.109
 slightly smaller and total was 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.180
 Here also everything adapted by the 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.879
 apps were rounded down 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.620
 but there is no adaptation for 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.420
 all apps as you can see for festo 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.310
 example has also been a abyss 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.069
 no ring gets a total look 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.659
 also getting used to but 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.329
 very nice and is also 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.189
 available for free now come already 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.310
 one of my favorites at least from the 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.180
 Free teams namely ultra flat for 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.579
 ios 7 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.889
 and this is free we said 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.389
 have few or respectively 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.489
 easy adaptation for example the 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.379
 Camera app has gotten an adjustment 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.450
 the photos app or even the app store 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.680
 itunes store Cydia and settings 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.970
 and I really like that 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.519
 personally pretty good so if you are 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 not an extremely new design but only 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.450
 a simple adaptation and all 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 other apps have been here in this one now 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.139
 just let it run normally 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.389
 no reduction or enlargement 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.340
 the icons and you can see it all 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.200
 little was adjusted a bit 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.060
 was changed and very much overall 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.919
 has stayed bad too 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.709
 free and very nice is the team i 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.379
 s 8 infiniti and we see that we are here 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.329
 have adjusted some apps 3d moderately 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.549
 so for example mail app store itunes 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.989
 to the phone and some were even now 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.970
 not adapted now has no 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.769
 get special update what I 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.510
 pity, but otherwise have 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.799
 actually all the apps here at first 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.169
 get an update page 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.790
 you see that down here in the dock the 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.919
 single writing advise something bigger 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.120
 are as normal on the homescreen what 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.099
 actually looks pretty good and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.229
 otherwise we have some here 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.349
 adjustments in the other apps we do 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.699
 here and for the special apps 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.699
 that have not been adjusted now, such as 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.229
 Although there are mathematics studies pro 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.449
 No adjustment but I find that it 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:18.130
 not too noticeable Doll now come 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.639
 we look for my personal favorites 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.729
 this episode namely 110 for two 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.590
 dollar 49 and we see a right here 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.509
 nice accommodation pretty nice design 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.190
 changes to individual apps 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.169
 for example on music or facebook or 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.270
 also to look at the safari also 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.130
 cydia was adjusted to the setting 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.960
 got an update app store and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.029
 itunes store also and here now 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.919
 Every app on this site actually has 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.390
 An adjustment we get now except 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.700
 the whatsapp 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.200
 and here for example now in 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.400
 my extras folder you see that very much 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.170
 much has been adjusted 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.550
 unfortunately not all apps, of course 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.290
 but I think it is not here 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.550
 too dolly when you go here for 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.810
 Example youtube comparison with the 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.850
 other apps I find that it is not 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.850
 too obvious and definitely 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.310
 looks pretty cool on the iphone 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.380
 now you see the free winter bot 7 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.700
 Ultra and you see that here too 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.620
 many have been adapted to the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.710
 attitude app looks similar again 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.840
 as under ios 6 or ios 5 of these drivers 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.310
 app has become very bad and too 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.990
 example the photos app is actually 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.340
 similar to 17 remained 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.630
 I personally like that 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.520
 pretty good we have here too 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.290
 adjustments for the app store and itunes 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.420
 store and on cydia a design here 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.250
 get update and also here in us 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.750
 look at the individual rooms in the folder 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.550
 we see that a lot of adapted 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.680
 were changed easily and simply 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.570
 and still very good at 17 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.130
 fit 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.980
 next you would like to seventy seven 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.660
 Imagine for two dollars 99 and this 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.640
 was something completely different I want 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.200
 of course a little different 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.210
 Show designs and you see that 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.550
 she really made her very different from her 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.500
 see that facebook the red even the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.970
 complete name in icon then has 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.200
 We adapted the music app here 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.140
 attitude looks completely different 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.300
 on the phone is this phone 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.980
 Input field to see and here, too 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.170
 mail app got an update 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.060
 for video stands for universal third 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.100
 then we would actually have here 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.630
 everything is adjusted and the apps are not 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.400
 be adapted as for example here 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.320
 my navi app will become easy 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.480
 rounded as well as this one 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.680
 all other apps is also seen 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.330
 actually pretty cool out is very 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.190
 getting used to in the beginning I have to 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.960
 honestly but in total actually 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.030
 really nice you have to stop 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.060
 see if the whole thing with everything 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.380
 if that fits in well then 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.420
 After all, it still looks good when you 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.860
 here also other app or used 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.900
 even if you open the apps we have 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.490
 here no direct adaptation in the 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.170
 app itself now here for example 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.640
 an attitude and if you then 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.230
 going back again is the contrast and 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.480
 the changes are pretty extreme 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.690
 but overall still a 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.800
 In any case, draw and illustrate 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.720
 we are already at the tenth and last 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.550
 arrived 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.530
 for ios 7 and many know that 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.110
 probably already it costs 2 dollars 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.640
 99 and was already with ios 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.160
 ex very well known and now have just that 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.720
 adaptation to us team to see quite well 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.690
 this is the setting for example 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.280
 looks similar to those under 16 then have 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.630
 Here we are the adjusted what I am 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.910
 personally very nice 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.620
 also became safari facebook music 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.720
 adapted for here around the cards app 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.920
 and also app store and itunes store 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.570
 have received an update 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.300
 we probably know the icons 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.520
 even from the 1.6 version at least 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.140
 all who knew the icon before 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.890
 and overall I really like it 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.330
 pretty good 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.160
 of course there are apps here too 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.260
 be improved it is very much 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.390
 on this difference between these 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.890
 others fit apps and the normal ones though 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.690
 Overall, I find one really very 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.080
 Nice team and should definitely be 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:37.900
 be installed on each device 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.520
 these were my top 10 winterbottoms in 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.140
 this third edition 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.790
 and I hope you have this video 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.290
