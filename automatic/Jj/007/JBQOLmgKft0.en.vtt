00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.779
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.730
 Yes Hello former Olympic Japan representative of the forest is Ken also athlete project today 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.030
 Thank you for seeing the school Ru MORITAKA 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.590
 ToDay 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:35.160
 We will introduce u type 10 foot kick 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 Are really moving this kick to alternating is cat's I mean this one foot Kikku' 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.020
 Even if you are aware of kicks, for example, the right is n't right 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.380
 The left is not hung This is not only 6 b and all the vents together 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.060
 This sometimes with Kke-out this 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.710
 Of course it's important to keep running so that your knees don't bend too much 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:00.910
 I will do it 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:02.440
 By giving a tonton book and core by one by one rather than being conscious with the kick of both schools 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.050
 Deviation after the pole 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:12.080
 If your knees move 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.310
 I won't go down and my knees can be fixed smoothly and kicked 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.750
 if you can 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:26.070
 Mariko that is willing will continue but this I even one leg was if there left since the foot-handed right foot 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:32.700
 You can't break it well in that state, even though you have practiced kicks before 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:40.770
 I think it feels like I'm swimming straight as the center of gravity rides to the right, though 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:46.060
 Actually, I have not been able to swim straight, so I adjust the left and right movement with a one-foot kick and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:52.390
 Please do practice by all means so as not to have 5 dishes 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:55.740
 This space- type kicking action alone will increase the number of tickets for these two schools in the field 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.740
 So please try 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:08.619
 I wonder how it was this one of Omori's advice one by one 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:13.140
 Please take a look at it carefully and then try it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:18.330
 And at that part of the forest and the park 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.000
 I'm getting it, but still it's an official document and I don't know how to answer 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.069
 There are many places to say 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.580
 Because 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:30.150
 In the future 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:33.720
 Do not let the video delivery no part of the comment not only live on the spot 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:40.140
 It is a form of exchanging 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 I'm thinking now, so by that time everyone is welcome to join us and direct again 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.569
 Question 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 And the answer we can form that is 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:52.030
 If you have an earlier part of this question 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:57.060
 At that time, please participate absolutely because you can return 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.060
 At that time, I will continue to answer that again .
