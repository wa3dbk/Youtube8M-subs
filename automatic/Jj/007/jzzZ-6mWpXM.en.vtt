the<00:01:36.390> tutorial<00:01:36.720> i<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.470> maybe<00:01:37.860> i<00:01:37.979> should

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the tutorial i don't know maybe i should

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
the tutorial i don't know maybe i should
have<00:01:38.460> actually<00:01:38.729> waited<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.509> guess<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> doesn't

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
have actually waited I guess it doesn't

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.810 
have actually waited I guess it doesn't
make<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.140> difference<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.979> mean<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
make much difference but I mean you have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.010 
make much difference but I mean you have
to<00:01:41.939> buy<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> builders<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> Builder<00:01:42.869> huts

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to buy the builders up the Builder huts

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950 
to buy the builders up the Builder huts
the<00:01:43.409> builders<00:01:44.100> heart<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> great<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.119> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the builders heart is great but this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
the builders heart is great but this
stuff<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.560> makes<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.369> skip<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> I

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
stuff that like makes you skip it I

legal hope getting the third builder
will<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.060> awesome<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:11.630> when<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.810> finally

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
will be awesome but when I finally

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.530 
will be awesome but when I finally
gettin<00:02:12.680> off<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.130> think<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:13.850> 500<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.510> I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
gettin off I think it's 500 so I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.140 
gettin off I think it's 500 so I
probably<00:02:14.990> take<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> while<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:17.320> yeah<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.760> yeah

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
probably take a while but yeah so yeah

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.270 
probably take a while but yeah so yeah
