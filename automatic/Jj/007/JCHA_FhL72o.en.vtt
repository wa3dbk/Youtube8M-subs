00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.010 
warm water and the water is going to
loosen<00:02:26.490> up<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> starter<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:27.720> gonna<00:02:27.840> make

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
loosen up the starter that's gonna make

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.480 
loosen up the starter that's gonna make
it<00:02:28.050> easier<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.650> strain<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.340> this

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
it easier to strain because at this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.510 
it easier to strain because at this
point<00:02:29.790> we<00:02:29.940> don't<00:02:30.060> need<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> grapes<00:02:30.690> anymore

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
point we don't need the grapes anymore

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.550 
point we don't need the grapes anymore
just<00:02:32.520> whisk<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
just whisk it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.120 
just whisk it
heaping<00:02:34.560> cup<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.890> flour<00:02:36.709> okay<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:37.860> wait<00:02:37.980> one

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
heaping cup of flour okay but wait one

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.030 
heaping cup of flour okay but wait one
second<00:02:38.550> first<00:02:39.360> I'm<00:02:39.480> gonna<00:02:39.660> strain<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.080> we'll

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
second first I'm gonna strain this we'll

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.520 
second first I'm gonna strain this we'll
just<00:02:41.070> push<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.000> through<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
just push it through with this the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.930 
just push it through with this the
grapes<00:02:43.769> have<00:02:43.950> done<00:02:44.130> their<00:02:44.280> job<00:02:44.489> they're<00:02:44.700> tired

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
grapes have done their job they're tired

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.180 
grapes have done their job they're tired
we're<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.420> gonna<00:02:45.510> discard<00:02:46.019> them<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.070> now

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
we're just gonna discard them and now

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.620 
we're just gonna discard them and now
that<00:02:47.400> we've<00:02:47.550> used<00:02:47.760> them<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.209> don't<00:02:48.390> need<00:02:48.480> them

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
that we've used them we don't need them

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
that we've used them we don't need them
anymore<00:02:48.690> let's<00:02:49.470> give<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.890> big<00:02:50.040> stir<00:02:51.950> now

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
anymore let's give this a big stir now

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.229 
anymore let's give this a big stir now
we<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> give<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.700> little<00:02:53.850> bit<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.060> a

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
we have to give this a little bit of a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.150 
we have to give this a little bit of a
rest<00:02:54.420> place<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.200> want<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.680> if

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
rest place because we want to see if

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.350 
rest place because we want to see if
it's<00:02:56.370> strong<00:02:56.610> enough<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.090> we're<00:02:57.209> going<00:02:57.300> to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
it's strong enough so we're going to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.320 
it's strong enough so we're going to
pour<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.690> into<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.989> two<00:02:58.140> jars<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:59.820> divide<00:03:00.180> this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
pour it into the two jars we divide this

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.870 
pour it into the two jars we divide this
up<00:03:06.920> there's<00:03:07.920> something<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.430> rewarding

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
up there's something really rewarding

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.590 
up there's something really rewarding
about<00:03:08.970> having<00:03:09.360> starter<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.750> your<00:03:09.959> shelf

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
about having starter on your shelf

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.350 
about having starter on your shelf
I<00:03:12.920> always<00:03:13.920> label<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.519> date<00:03:14.610> things<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.209> way

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
I always label and date things that way

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.550 
I always label and date things that way
I<00:03:15.390> never<00:03:15.690> lose<00:03:15.840> track<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.170> time

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
I never lose track of time

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.590 
I never lose track of time
and<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> morning<00:03:18.180> by<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
and if you do this in the morning by the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.270 
and if you do this in the morning by the
end<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.989> day<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.170> should<00:03:19.350> be<00:03:19.500> able<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.040> see

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
end of the day you should be able to see

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.230 
end of the day you should be able to see
if<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.060> strong<00:03:21.269> enough<00:03:22.640> high<00:03:23.640> five

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.460 

okay<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.420> thing<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.780> went<00:03:29.960> almost<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
okay that thing you went almost to the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.170 
okay that thing you went almost to the
top<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.890> jar<00:03:31.070> I'd<00:03:31.250> say<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:31.970> is<00:03:32.030> a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
top of the jar I'd say that this is a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.060 
top of the jar I'd say that this is a
strong<00:03:32.480> starter<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.680> think<00:03:33.890> we're<00:03:33.980> gonna

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
strong starter and I think we're gonna

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.210 
strong starter and I think we're gonna
make<00:03:34.340> some<00:03:34.610> bread<00:03:34.880> now<00:03:35.800> after<00:03:36.800> we<00:03:36.890> take<00:03:37.100> the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
make some bread now after we take the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.870 
make some bread now after we take the
cup<00:03:37.400> out<00:03:37.550> we're<00:03:37.700> gonna<00:03:37.790> use<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.330> do<00:03:38.510> a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
cup out we're gonna use that to do a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.270 
cup out we're gonna use that to do a
sponge<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.210> our<00:03:41.570> bread<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.800> want<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.100> keep

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
sponge for our bread you want to keep

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.090 
sponge for our bread you want to keep
feeding<00:03:43.780> we're<00:03:44.780> gonna<00:03:44.900> do<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:45.800> doesn't

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
feeding we're gonna do so it doesn't

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:58.980 
feeding we're gonna do so it doesn't
expose<00:03:46.400> we're<00:03:46.730> going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.380> put<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.500> lid<00:03:48.740> on

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.460 

there<00:03:59.990> you<00:04:00.140> go<00:04:01.750> we're<00:04:02.750> going<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.110> make<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:03.380> a

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
there you go we're going to make it a

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:12.640 
there you go we're going to make it a
little<00:04:03.650> safer<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.840> other<00:04:05.990> side<00:04:10.960> so<00:04:11.960> this<00:04:12.470> is

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
little safer the other side so this is

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.820 
little safer the other side so this is
actually<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.130> starters<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:15.230> it's<00:04:15.470> actually

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
actually the starters and it's actually

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.830 
actually the starters and it's actually
nicer<00:04:16.190> it's<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.430> living<00:04:16.700> thing

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.900 

you
