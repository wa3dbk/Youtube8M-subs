is a tester of my keychain video camera
this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.860> test<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.579> my<00:02:26.640> keychain<00:02:27.150> video

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
this is a test of my keychain video

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:36.009 
this is a test of my keychain video
camera<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:30.299> records<00:02:31.159> color<00:02:32.480> video<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:34.319> audio

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
camera it records color video with audio

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.809 
camera it records color video with audio
as<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.349> see<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.010> could<00:02:38.189> just<00:02:38.370> hold<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:38.700> in

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
as you can see you could just hold it in

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.990 
as you can see you could just hold it in
your<00:02:38.909> hand<00:02:39.409> pick<00:02:40.409> this<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.189> go<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> walk

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.199 

just<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:46.519> going<00:02:47.519> for<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> walk<00:02:47.940> nobody

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
just like that going for a walk nobody

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.470 
just like that going for a walk nobody
knows<00:02:48.599> it's<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.959> my<00:02:49.139> hand<00:02:51.019> or<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.849> place<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
knows it's in my hand or if you place it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.520 
knows it's in my hand or if you place it
somewhere<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:56.569> place<00:02:57.569> be<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.810> key<00:02:58.260> over

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
somewhere like this place be a key over

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.780 
somewhere like this place be a key over
there<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.629> can<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.250> walk<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.280> by

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
there and you can just walk right by

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.099 
there and you can just walk right by
know<00:03:03.000> what<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.239> even<00:03:03.329> know<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:03.870> it's

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
know what do you even know that it's

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.849 
know what do you even know that it's
recording<00:03:04.650> because<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.340> keychain

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
recording because it's just a keychain

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.460 
recording because it's just a keychain
always<00:03:07.859> going<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.129> notice<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:09.170> chain<00:03:10.170> laying

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
always going to notice a chain laying

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.730 
always going to notice a chain laying
there

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.960 

I<00:03:14.110> have<00:03:15.110> an<00:03:15.230> eight<00:03:15.410> gig<00:03:15.710> memory<00:03:16.220> card<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.790> there

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
I have an eight gig memory card in there

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.280 
I have an eight gig memory card in there
so<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.810> should<00:03:19.450> record<00:03:20.450> for<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> couple<00:03:21.230> hours

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
so that should record for a couple hours

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.660 
so that should record for a couple hours
in<00:03:21.650> addition<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> batteries<00:03:22.460> died<00:03:22.640> I

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
in addition to the batteries died I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.040 
in addition to the batteries died I
think<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> batteries<00:03:23.510> will<00:03:23.630> last<00:03:23.660> about

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
think the batteries will last about

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.510 
think the batteries will last about
three<00:03:24.440> or<00:03:24.470> four<00:03:24.590> hours<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:27.560> there<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.460> is

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
three or four hours so there it is

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.960 
three or four hours so there it is
that's<00:03:28.880> my<00:03:29.380> quick<00:03:30.380> review<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.400> keychain

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
that's my quick review of the keychain

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.320 
that's my quick review of the keychain
video<00:03:32.360> recorder<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.790> as<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.090> see<00:03:35.120> you

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
video recorder and as you can see you

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.000 
video recorder and as you can see you
can<00:03:35.540> put<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:35.990> anywhere<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.650> it's<00:03:36.830> very

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
can put it anywhere and it's very

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.710 
can put it anywhere and it's very
discreet<00:03:37.430> nobody<00:03:37.820> will<00:03:38.000> know<00:03:38.240> that<00:03:38.570> you're

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
discreet nobody will know that you're

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.080 
discreet nobody will know that you're
recording<00:03:39.080> their<00:03:39.410> audio<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:40.040> video<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.700> color

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
something that they completely deny you

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.430 
something that they completely deny you
can<00:03:47.120> get<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.360> on<00:03:47.450> video<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:47.930> prove<00:03:48.140> them<00:03:48.170> wrong

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
can get it on video and prove them wrong

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.910 
can get it on video and prove them wrong
now<00:03:48.710> you<00:03:49.370> know<00:03:49.910> for<00:03:50.870> all<00:03:50.900> legal<00:03:51.200> purposes<00:03:51.740> I
