 Martin 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.479
 one 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:09.849
 min 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.849
 min 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.839
 min 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.970
 the media 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.470
 they are not part of reality 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.470
 they are part of the game the power 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.690
 express 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.000
 the look of the one behind the microphone looks at who is behind 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.210
 of the camera in the look that this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 the getafe or the one in front of the computer 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.490
 rosemary that pressures a construction of reality 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.760
 a braking 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 it is a story 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.390
 that the actor 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.520
 it is never objective 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.870
 because it's really 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.520
 cut 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.680
 for the universe 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 and by the way of understanding of who writes it and reads who record of the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 reality 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.250
 plus 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.969
 and yes we should ask for objectivity from the media 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.650
 it is a claim 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 misplaced trivia what we have to ask the media 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 I would say more than the media to journalists that journalists 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.620
 it is truthfulness 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.300
 and transparency to tell us from what sad place reporting since 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.380
 the final west ham 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.790
 p 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.410
 information can only be transformed into knowledge through 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.820
 the collective construction 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.670
 of the multiple actors of society 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 the information is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.680
 an input 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.530
 what has to go through processes of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.100
 of resignification by processes of reinterpretation 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.740
 and this is done in the framework 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.409
 That's why the communicators ocde of production exchange and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.540
 Negotiation of feeling society 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.070
 we do not negotiate permanently 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.620
 and this devotion or 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.389
 as we will see how we thought how we build 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:12.419
 In training 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.689
 this penalty is an input of that 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.879
 It's also true 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.649
 that this process is crossed by the power 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:22.779
 the production of knowledge 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.199
 from the information 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.669
 in your ship, fight is a symbolic battle and therefore it is a battle 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.419
 of power 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.889
 where some that some 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.969
 pretend a pub 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.009
 build a hegemony a hegemony of knowledge 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.639
 that in terms 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.659
 p the simple language ends up being me that at some point lilian 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.809
 we mentioned as common sense 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.579
 common sense 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.469
 it's something like this 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.469
 the category with which they look 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:03.659
 it's something like the glasses with which we look at reality and we finish 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.469
 interpreting 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.429
 and those who pretend 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.709
 from a logic of power 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.040
 generate knowledge in a certain sense 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.110
 they want everyone 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.589
 let's put on our glasses 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:21.009
 what they express their look 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.419
 transform information with cement is possible 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.279
 presented is a task of a difficult process 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.679
 cumbersome 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.159
 which has complex 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.259
 That has to do with 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:40.859
 the e the interaction of the subjects the collective actors in the society 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.839
 where each one puts at stake his way of understanding and his way of being 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.820
 and the result of knowledge result 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.199
 it's at the same time 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.539
 with the scientific result 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.539
 and the political result 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:02.739
 of a negotiation and a power struggle between different rural actors 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.709
 min 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.709
 and current technological development 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:14.619
 to ambiguous situations 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.370
 actually 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.389
 gives a first idea generates a first image of 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.809
 plurality and diversity 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.020
 what could 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.510
 thus improving is a huge democratization of communication 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:29.939
 I think 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:33.939
 effectively the technological development and with it the neurological development 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.309
 I'm talking 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.600
 of all internet applications 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.580
 until 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.809
 the possibilities of another digital development 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.369
 when started in front of this effectively alternatives are generated 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.340
 the way 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.710
 or on the beach that this can be appropriated can be used from 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.520
 a change perspective only 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.430
 from building networks 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.990
 of the construction of ships 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.010
 not deny 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.620
 cedeÃ±o of communication policies 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.840
 that integrate the different actors because the risk 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:11.210
 the risk is that 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.349
 this multiplicity of voices and actors 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.349
 on the one hand soles and so bad montelar 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.370
 Per hundred we finished 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.690
 inducing that a logic of more fragmentation 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:26.020
 and fragmentation 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.599
 it is not communication the fragmentation is more without communication 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.099
 from another side 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.229
 the other risk in the memory some concept of anibal ford in the forum sun 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.979
 and tell us about the report thing poor info the problem of those who have access and 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.719
 those who do not have access 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.950
 you both have a map I see there are a number of possibilities you need 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.720
 d integrative policies and a will to build in the communicational 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.730
 communication policies 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.500
 those that the state can not be foreign the state needs to take initiatives 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.250
 concrete measures to guarantee also in this sector communication mario 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.530
 diverse that is enriched with new technologies does not end 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.719
 again 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.279
 yes monopolized or only by those who have political economic power 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.619
 or cultural even your soccer 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:26.099
 so much azharuddin
