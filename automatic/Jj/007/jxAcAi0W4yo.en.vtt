00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
anywhere on the planet like these two so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
anywhere on the planet like these two so
you<00:00:58.500> start<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:58.949> Gotham<00:00:59.370> City<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.730> course

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you start out in Gotham City of course

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
sister who seems to be hurt you figure

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.080 
sister who seems to be hurt you figure
she<00:01:04.830> could<00:01:04.979> probably<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> doctor<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

seriously the rampage went on and on at

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.979 
seriously the rampage went on and on at
first<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.430> was<00:04:15.580> skeptical<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.150> how<00:04:16.299> access<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
first I was skeptical of how access to a

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.170 
first I was skeptical of how access to a
library<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.650> DC<00:04:18.010> Universe<00:04:18.370> objects<00:04:18.880> would<00:04:18.970> fit

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
library of DC Universe objects would fit

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.390 
library of DC Universe objects would fit
in<00:04:19.299> with<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.510> Scribblenauts<00:04:20.080> game<00:04:20.320> I'd<00:04:21.130> say<00:04:21.370> I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
in with a Scribblenauts game I'd say I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.310 
in with a Scribblenauts game I'd say I
have<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.640> pretty<00:04:21.850> above-average<00:04:22.419> amount<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.900> DC

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
have a pretty above-average amount of DC

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.810 
have a pretty above-average amount of DC
knowledge<00:04:23.710> but<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.010> knew<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.370> was<00:04:24.460> nowhere

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
knowledge but I knew that it was nowhere

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.310 
knowledge but I knew that it was nowhere
close<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.210> extensive<00:04:25.660> enough<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.960> dream<00:04:26.200> up

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
close to extensive enough to dream up

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.780 
close to extensive enough to dream up
most<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> things<00:04:27.070> this<00:04:27.280> game<00:04:27.490> had<00:04:27.670> to

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
most of the things this game had to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.610 
most of the things this game had to
offer<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.300> sort<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.870> thought<00:04:29.020> I'd<00:04:29.140> be<00:04:29.260> missing

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
offer I sort of thought I'd be missing

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.350 
offer I sort of thought I'd be missing
out<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.280> realized<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.850> access<00:04:31.240> to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
out but then I realized that access to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.670 
out but then I realized that access to
all<00:04:31.420> these<00:04:31.570> extra<00:04:31.840> characters<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.320> objects

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
all these extra characters and objects

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.620 
all these extra characters and objects
was<00:04:32.890> just<00:04:33.130> really<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.400> bonus<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.330> could<00:04:34.480> even

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
was just really a bonus and I could even

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.970 
was just really a bonus and I could even
stand<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.020> learn<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.230> thing<00:04:35.470> or<00:04:35.590> two<00:04:35.650> about<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
stand to learn a thing or two about the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.470 
stand to learn a thing or two about the
