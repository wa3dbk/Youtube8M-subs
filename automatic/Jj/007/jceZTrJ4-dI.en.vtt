 I know there was a time there 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.260
 no smartphones, yes, but nowadays 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.160

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.740

 discovered and indeed you can completely 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.260
 just make a holder and for that 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.460
 you need a lesson from the following things 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.250
 Body lotion bottle a pair of scissors and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.950

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.940
 For that I take the scissors and cut 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.350
 me here in front 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.940

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.799
 targeted, of course, only the phone with 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.890
 the charging cable and although I can now 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.800
 to hide the cable 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.700
 just here so once and then 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.790
 that disappears with the phone 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.440
 Go in here and then go up here 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.989
 the plug through and into the socket 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.880
