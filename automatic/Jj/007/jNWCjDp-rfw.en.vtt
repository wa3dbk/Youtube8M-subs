good also but but that's not what we're
talking<00:03:31.200> about<00:03:31.350> today<00:03:31.470> we're<00:03:31.680> talking<00:03:31.739> about

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
talking about today we're talking about

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.979 
talking about today we're talking about
the<00:03:32.100> beginning<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.940> dailies<00:03:33.239> done<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.780> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
the bridge and you got your galaxy map

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.780 
the bridge and you got your galaxy map
here<00:04:10.540> but<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.860> where<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.160> pick<00:04:12.370> up<00:04:12.550> your

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
here but this is where you pick up your

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.140 
here but this is where you pick up your
space<00:04:13.120> dailies<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.280> same<00:04:15.520> way<00:04:15.790> are<00:04:15.940> very

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
space dailies it's the same way are very

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.670 
space dailies it's the same way are very
similar<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.510> flashpoints<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.500> pick

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
similar to flashpoints is that you pick

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.190 
similar to flashpoints is that you pick
a<00:04:18.090> daily<00:04:19.090> space<00:04:19.930> mission<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.650> let's<00:04:21.250> say<00:04:22.200> here

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
a daily space mission and let's say here

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.590 
a daily space mission and let's say here
you're<00:04:23.590> going<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.800> complete<00:04:24.280> two<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:25.390> these

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
you're going to complete two of these

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.659 
you're going to complete two of these
space<00:04:25.930> missions<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.530> mission<00:04:26.890> 1<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.070> mission<00:04:27.460> to

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
space missions so mission 1 a mission to

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.030 
space missions so mission 1 a mission to
like<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.510> says<00:04:28.800> here<00:04:30.930> this<00:04:31.950> mission<00:04:32.950> number

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
like it says here this mission number

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.540 
like it says here this mission number
one<00:04:33.370> mission<00:04:34.090> number<00:04:34.240> two<00:04:34.600> right<00:04:34.930> here<00:04:35.550> once

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
one mission number two right here once

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.890 
one mission number two right here once
you<00:04:36.640> do<00:04:36.730> both<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:36.910> these<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.660> will

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
you do both of these it will

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.750 
you do both of these it will
automatically<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.919> know<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.190> turnitin<00:04:39.580> nose

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
automatically you know the turnitin nose

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.640 
automatically you know the turnitin nose
automatically<00:04:40.240> be<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> turn<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.380> once<00:04:41.560> you

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
automatically be a turn and once you

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.670 
automatically be a turn and once you
complete<00:04:41.950> that<00:04:41.980> second<00:04:42.550> mission<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:44.380> yeah

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
complete that second mission so yeah

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.900 
complete that second mission so yeah
that's<00:04:45.100> going<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.460> give<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.700> lot<00:04:45.850> of

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
that's going to give you a lot of

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.320 
that's going to give you a lot of
experience<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.540> also<00:04:47.280> there<00:04:48.280> are<00:04:48.330> space

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
experience and also there are space

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.360 
experience and also there are space
mission<00:04:49.840> quests<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.650> believe<00:04:51.130> it's<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.340> same

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
mission quests I believe it's the same

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.270 
mission quests I believe it's the same
way<00:04:51.580> for<00:04:51.730> flash<00:04:51.910> points<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.390> every<00:04:52.690> new

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
way for flash points for every new

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.409 
way for flash points for every new
mission<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.400> becomes<00:04:54.700> available<00:04:55.000> or

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
mission that becomes available or

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.420 
mission that becomes available or
appropriate<00:04:55.900> for<00:04:56.080> your<00:04:56.169> level<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:57.100> can<00:04:57.310> pick

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
appropriate for your level you can pick

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.060 
appropriate for your level you can pick
up<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.700> quest<00:04:57.940> over<00:04:58.270> here<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:59.230> will<00:04:59.530> give

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
up the quest over here that will give

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.850 
up the quest over here that will give
you<00:05:00.690> will<00:05:01.690> be<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:01.840> quest<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.200> complete<00:05:02.380> that

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
you will be a quest to complete that

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.360 
you will be a quest to complete that
mission<00:05:03.160> or<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.790> battle<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.510> space<00:05:04.810> battle

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
mission or that battle that space battle

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.730 
mission or that battle that space battle
which<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.580> do<00:05:06.790> by<00:05:07.000> going<00:05:07.180> into<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:08.620> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
which you do by going into the to the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.070 
which you do by going into the to the
galaxy<00:05:09.160> map<00:05:09.310> here<00:05:09.669> and<00:05:09.850> so<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.150> your<00:05:10.270> area<00:05:10.690> in

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
galaxy map here and so in your area in

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.900 
galaxy map here and so in your area in
weather<00:05:12.040> channel<00:05:12.490> there<00:05:12.640> because<00:05:12.820> that's

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
weather channel there because that's

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.820 
weather channel there because that's
where<00:05:13.030> illness

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
where illness

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.140 
where illness
here<00:05:15.830> are<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.009> space<00:05:16.280> battles<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:16.910> what<00:05:17.030> they

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
here are the space battles and what they

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.939 
here are the space battles and what they
look<00:05:17.330> like<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.110> just<00:05:18.169> need<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.470> do<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.740> one

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
look like so you just need to do the one

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.159 
look like so you just need to do the one
