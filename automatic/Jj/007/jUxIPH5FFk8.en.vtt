I put bar and lime on the floor and that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.850 
I put bar and lime on the floor and that
helps<00:00:46.580> control<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.360> ammonia<00:00:47.840> smell<00:00:48.020> bar

lime<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.400> very<00:00:49.670> cheap<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.570> recommend<00:00:50.989> doing

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
lime is very cheap and I recommend doing

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.890 
lime is very cheap and I recommend doing
that<00:00:51.559> it's<00:00:51.890> very<00:00:52.160> good<00:00:52.400> cleaner<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.629> helps

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
that it's very good cleaner and helps

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.810 
that it's very good cleaner and helps
with<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.170> smell<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.830> I<00:00:54.920> recommend<00:00:55.340> putting

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
with the smell and I recommend putting

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.360 
with the smell and I recommend putting
down<00:00:56.210> pine<00:00:56.690> wood<00:00:56.960> shavings<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.040> can<00:00:58.190> get

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
down pine wood shavings and you can get

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.970 
down pine wood shavings and you can get
those<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.120> any<00:00:59.360> farm<00:00:59.720> store<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:00.769> a

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
those that like any farm store it's a

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.530 
those that like any farm store it's a
good<00:01:01.190> bedding<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.730> especially<00:01:02.089> in<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
good bedding and especially in the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.689 
good bedding and especially in the
winter<00:01:02.720> time<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.530> want<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.100> put<00:01:04.309> more<00:01:04.550> in

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
winter time you want to put more in

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.760 
winter time you want to put more in
there<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.180> keep<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.540> chickens<00:01:05.960> warmer<00:01:06.530> so

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
there to keep the chickens warmer so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.460 
there to keep the chickens warmer so
they<00:01:06.890> can<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.220> comfortable<00:01:07.700> one<00:01:08.300> thing<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:09.290> do

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
they can get comfortable one thing to do

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.260 
they can get comfortable one thing to do
when<00:01:09.860> your<00:01:10.010> chickens<00:01:10.430> first<00:01:10.670> start<00:01:11.000> laying

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
when your chickens first start laying

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.960 
when your chickens first start laying
eggs<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:12.050> want<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.500> make<00:01:12.680> sure<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.700> put
