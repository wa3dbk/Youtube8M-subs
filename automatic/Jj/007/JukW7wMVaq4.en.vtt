00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.089
 cope with the traffic of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.470
 a big city ​​might look like one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.750
 impossible mission for a small car 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 but not for the new smart forfour that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 on the basis of the smallest fortune yes 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.889
 evolves adding two more places and does 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.889
 pure rhyme 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.619
 aesthetic forms make it seem more 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.960
 awkward like this front 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.689
 with a crushed muzzle that, however, like 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.599
 you can see it does not hide its side 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.130
 gritty and nice as you can see 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.129
 in the side there are two doors 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.710
 more clearly portur and in this 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.449
 case the body is solid color but 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.870
 don't worry because you can have it 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.750
 in the classic double smarter tone 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.400
 even the beautiful 16-inch wheels 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.330
 even the rear really transmits 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.540
 so much sympathy 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.610
 thanks to these chubby options the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.400
 engine remains here just below 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.559
 as always he has not changed position a 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.900
 difference from the fortwo instead 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.739
 tailgate as you can see is not 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.690
 been split 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.640
 unfortunately the fact of the engine is behind 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.860
 makes sure that the load threshold is the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.240
 floor is high but this is new 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.280
 furfur is forgiven 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.530
 thanks to the extra space it offers later 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.600
 having knocked down the rear seats and if 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.549
 you want you can also lower that on the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.320
 passenger side inside you can enjoy one 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.359
 pleasant dashboard that welcomes the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.460
 technological infotainment system and the 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.990
 steering wheel with a bombarded sports accent 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.939
 from commands with which you can play 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.770
 the front seat is great 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.640
 comfortable and no legroom 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.590
 it lacks 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.780
 if it has medium height behind ice 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.780
 comfortable otherwise a little less 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 you know what on the road this new for 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.159
 four does not disappoint indeed surprises the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.340
 visibility is not bad you see well 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.070
 front and back at the moment we are in Rome 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.990
 beautiful city very busy though 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.280
 thanks to the rear-view mirrors 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 big you can have a great one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.420
 situation control 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.130
 but let's talk about the steering now that it is 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.700
 one of the strengths of this new one 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.039
 smart forfour and precise and direct for the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.920
 city ​​guide and new broad grace 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.019
 turning radius do parking or 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 u-turns 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.410
 It is not a problem at the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.890
 luck the same novelty as the new one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.560
 fortwo that is the 5-speed manual gearbox 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.709
 change that has good grafts the race 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.530
 and the clutch pedal carries a lot 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.410
 light so good thing 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.780
 pity though it has gears a little 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.599
 too long and this penalizes a little 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.880
 engine performance than in this 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.970
 case is a 1000 aspirated by 70 horses 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.530
 maybe and 1090 young turbo 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.090
 anyway if you want among the options 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.420
 also found the new automatic transmission 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.340
 double clutch completely new e 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.319
 which replaces the previous one is 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.620
 old or robotic that you leave me 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.780
 to say the motor dandruff was a bit boring 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.250
 and rear-wheel drive so I guess 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.850
 that everyone wants to know how to leverage up 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.290
 street well the controls are always 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.709
 hyperactive so you can go on 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.690
 sure 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.940
 I also tried somehow a 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.510
 provoke it but it does not take off from there 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.430
 so forget about understeer 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.430
 oversteer skids or something like that 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.790
 the peculiarities of this new for four 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.070
 the steering angle is the engine and the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.990
 rear wheel drive that make it unique 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.120
 of its kind compared to the competition 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.550
 but know that some rivals offer to 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.080
 more in terms of luggage and comfort 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.070
 for rear passengers 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.720
 in this test I could not 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.540
 deepen consumption but the home 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.110
 declares an average of more than 20 km 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.910
 with a liter 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.160
 if you often find yourself fighting against 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.050
 the traffic of the big cities to two 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.220
 then the forfour is not enough for you 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.290
 meets your needs 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.150
 in addition, she does not lack the spirit 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.760
 toy inherited the little sister 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.120
 fortwo what you think 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.120
 let me know
