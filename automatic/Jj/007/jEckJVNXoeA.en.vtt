power to the bulb the light getting

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.830 
power to the bulb the light getting
brighter<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.330> wider<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.920> my<00:02:56.160> 6000k<00:02:57.120> bulb<00:02:57.660> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
brighter and wider now my 6000k bulb is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.310 
brighter and wider now my 6000k bulb is
now<00:02:58.310> running<00:02:59.310> at<00:02:59.550> what<00:02:59.790> looks<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.090> 5,000<00:03:01.050> K

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
now running at what looks like 5,000 K

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.090 
now running at what looks like 5,000 K
and<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.830> keeps<00:03:02.070> getting<00:03:02.250> wider<00:03:02.550> as<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and it keeps getting wider as you up the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.010 
and it keeps getting wider as you up the
power<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:07.350> right<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.770> have<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.100> little

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
power so right now I have a little

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.330 
power so right now I have a little
drawing<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.230> little<00:03:10.380> bit<00:03:10.560> over<00:03:10.860> five<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.100> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
drawing a little bit over five and a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.740 
drawing a little bit over five and a
half<00:03:11.370> amps<00:03:12.560> now<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.790> particular<00:03:15.180> ballot

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
half amps now on this particular ballot

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.990 
half amps now on this particular ballot
does<00:03:16.020> ntek<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.920> if<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:18.150> turn<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> too<00:03:18.660> far<00:03:18.959> it

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
does ntek the if you turn it too far it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.360 
does ntek the if you turn it too far it
start<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.910> run<00:03:24.810> away<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.739> will<00:03:25.830> shoot

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
start the to run away and it will shoot

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.930 
start the to run away and it will shoot
straight<00:03:26.700> up<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.000> 9<00:03:27.209> amps<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.940> try

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
straight up to 9 amps like that so try

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.250 
straight up to 9 amps like that so try
to<00:03:29.970> keep<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.420> below<00:03:30.570> 6<00:03:30.989> amps<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:33.120> I'll<00:03:33.570> briefly

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
to keep it below 6 amps but I'll briefly

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.020 
to keep it below 6 amps but I'll briefly
run<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.800> for<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:36.020> could<00:03:37.020> see<00:03:37.230> how<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:38.030> dims

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
run it up for you could see how it dims

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.060 
run it up for you could see how it dims
and<00:03:39.330> brightens<00:03:39.810> as<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.320> turn<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.739> knob<00:03:42.920> turn<00:03:43.920> it

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
and brightens as I turn the knob turn it

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.570 
and brightens as I turn the knob turn it
back<00:03:44.280> down<00:03:45.470> let's<00:03:46.470> see<00:03:46.739> where<00:03:47.040> should<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.250> set

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
back down let's see where should I set

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.600 
back down let's see where should I set
this<00:03:50.660> now<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.690> found<00:03:52.500> out<00:03:52.769> if<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.040> run<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.370> at<00:03:53.459> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
this now I found out if I run it at the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.780 
this now I found out if I run it at the
9<00:03:53.820> amp<00:03:54.090> setting<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.870> tends<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.860> get<00:03:56.070> hot<00:03:56.340> pretty

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
9 amp setting it tends to get hot pretty

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.360 
9 amp setting it tends to get hot pretty
quick<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.660> haven't<00:03:57.989> run<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.350> for<00:03:59.130> more<00:03:59.340> than

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
quick and I haven't run it for more than

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.430 
quick and I haven't run it for more than
a<00:03:59.610> minute<00:03:59.940> at<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.330> setting<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:01.050> don't<00:04:01.290> know

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
a minute at that setting I don't know

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.020 
a minute at that setting I don't know
what<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.769> longitude<00:04:02.400> biondi's<00:04:03.120> Chiba<00:04:05.030> HID

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.820 
what the longitude biondi's Chiba HID
ballast<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.140> actually<00:04:07.320> get<00:04:07.650> these

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
ballast are you can actually get these

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.290 
ballast are you can actually get these
valves<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:08.550> 10<00:04:09.420> bucks<00:04:09.720> on<00:04:09.959> eBay<00:04:11.300> but

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
valves for like 10 bucks on eBay but

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.840 
valves for like 10 bucks on eBay but
I'll<00:04:12.709> probably<00:04:13.709> keep<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.190> at<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.519> power

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
I'll probably keep it at this power

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.130 
I'll probably keep it at this power
setting<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:16.430> five<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.640> half<00:04:17.700> am

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.200 

see<00:04:21.140> I'm<00:04:21.290> going<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.620> add<00:04:21.740> just<00:04:21.950> turn<00:04:22.670> it<00:04:22.760> down<00:04:22.970> a

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
see I'm going to add just turn it down a

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.570 
see I'm going to add just turn it down a
little<00:04:23.570> bit<00:04:29.470> maybe<00:04:30.470> five<00:04:30.800> amps<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.400> the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
little bit maybe five amps is the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.620 
little bit maybe five amps is the
maximum<00:04:32.230> so<00:04:33.230> at<00:04:34.270> what's<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:37.330> twelve<00:04:38.330> point

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
maximum so at what's the twelve point

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
maximum so at what's the twelve point
six<00:04:38.840> volts<00:04:39.290> on<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.590> battery<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.810> just<00:04:42.440> uh

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
six volts on the battery and just uh

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.860 
six volts on the battery and just uh
I'll<00:04:43.250> say<00:04:43.520> just<00:04:43.790> 12<00:04:44.060> volt<00:04:44.300> phenomenal

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
I'll say just 12 volt phenomenal

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.310 
I'll say just 12 volt phenomenal
multiplied<00:04:45.740> by<00:04:45.980> five<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.480> drawing<00:04:47.690> 61

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
multiplied by five so this is drawing 61

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.880 
multiplied by five so this is drawing 61
of<00:04:48.590> course<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.430> ballast<00:04:49.790> isn't<00:04:50.120> really<00:04:50.420> that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
of course the ballast isn't really that

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.370 
of course the ballast isn't really that
efficient<00:04:51.890> so<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.430> probably<00:04:53.060> would<00:04:53.300> be<00:04:53.840> giving

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
efficient so I probably would be giving

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.840 
efficient so I probably would be giving
about<00:04:54.650> fifty<00:04:55.550> seven<00:04:55.910> watts<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.420> the<00:04:56.540> bulb<00:04:57.850> that

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
about fifty seven watts to the bulb that

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.900 
about fifty seven watts to the bulb that
gets<00:04:59.090> me<00:04:59.270> wondering<00:04:59.510> if<00:04:59.900> those<00:05:00.170> 55<00:05:01.040> watt<00:05:01.370> hid

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
gets me wondering if those 55 watt hid

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.140 
gets me wondering if those 55 watt hid
