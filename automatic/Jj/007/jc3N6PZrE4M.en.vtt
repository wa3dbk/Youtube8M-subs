you know it's a game of infinite
possibilities<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> while<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.710> actual

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
possibilities and while the actual

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.510 
possibilities and while the actual
building<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.500> these<00:01:01.500> things<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.160> quite

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
building of these things are quite

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.679 
building of these things are quite
difficult<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.329> takes<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.470> lot<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> time<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
difficult and takes a lot of time and

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
difficult and takes a lot of time and
there's<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> high<00:01:07.020> learning<00:01:07.290> curve<00:01:07.500> which<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
there's a high learning curve which I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.899 
there's a high learning curve which I
highly<00:01:08.580> admit<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.840> being<00:01:10.110> true<00:01:10.909> but

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
highly admit that that's being true but

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.850 
highly admit that that's being true but
with<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> being<00:01:12.360> said<00:01:12.450> there's<00:01:13.350> also<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
with that being said there's also this

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
with that being said there's also this
other<00:01:14.070> aspect<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> game<00:01:15.030> that's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
other aspect of the game that's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.870 
other aspect of the game that's
community<00:01:16.320> driven<00:01:16.560> where<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.700> play

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
community driven where you can play

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.840 
community driven where you can play
through<00:01:18.530> lots<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.740> people's<00:01:20.159> games<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
through lots of people's games that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
through lots of people's games that
they've<00:01:21.060> created<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> something

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
they've created and this is something

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.410 
they've created and this is something
that's<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> expand<00:01:23.790> once<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> game

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that's going to expand once the game

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
that's going to expand once the game
actually<00:01:24.630> releases<00:01:25.350> later<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.740> year<00:01:25.950> right

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
with the conker assets I'm interested to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
with the conker assets I'm interested to
see<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.340> some<00:01:35.759> crazy<00:01:36.150> conker<00:01:36.720> fan<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> going

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
see what some crazy conker fan is going

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
see what some crazy conker fan is going
to<00:01:37.409> create<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.939> there's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to create with that you know there's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.580 
to create with that you know there's
going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.329> lots<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.869> different<00:01:39.930> games<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
going to be lots of different games to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
going to be lots of different games to
play<00:01:40.799> through<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.450> let's<00:01:42.450> face<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> next

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
play through and let's face it the next

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.670 
play through and let's face it the next
generation<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:44.090> developers<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.470> there

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
generation of developers is out there

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
generation of developers is out there
right<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:46.979> playing<00:01:47.490> these<00:01:47.729> games<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> think

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
right now playing these games so I think

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
right now playing these games so I think
that's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> great<00:01:49.740> idea<00:01:50.240> for<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> get

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that's a great idea for them to get

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.330 
that's a great idea for them to get
started<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.140> something<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.590> project<00:01:53.100> spark

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
started on something like project spark

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.639 
started on something like project spark
it's<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.850> in-depth<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.899> said<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it's very in-depth and like I said you

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.080 
it's very in-depth and like I said you
have<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> patience<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
have to have a lot of patience and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.260 
have to have a lot of patience and
understanding<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:58.140> fully<00:01:58.820> understand<00:01:59.820> what

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
understanding to fully understand what

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
understanding to fully understand what
project<00:02:00.869> spark<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> create

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
project spark is and how to create

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.090 
project spark is and how to create
things<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.240> once<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.780> make<00:02:04.100> um

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
things with it but once you do make um

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
things with it but once you do make um
second<00:02:05.490> nature<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.780> said

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
second nature you know but as I said

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240 
second nature you know but as I said
there's<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.290> whole<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.530> side<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
there's this whole other side to it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.550 
there's this whole other side to it
where<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.840> build<00:02:10.259> anything

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
where you can just not build anything

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.500 
where you can just not build anything
yourself<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.280> rather<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.700> play<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> games

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
yourself but rather just play the games

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.910 
yourself but rather just play the games
that<00:02:12.870> people<00:02:12.930> have<00:02:13.410> created

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that people have created

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.100 
that people have created
and<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.880> can<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.150> fun<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.480> well<00:02:15.630> because<00:02:15.960> it's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and that can be fun as well because it's

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.949 
and that can be fun as well because it's
all<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:16.440> games<00:02:16.740> within<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.310> game<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.000> it's
