because it field it was the lack of
intensity<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.759> those<00:01:36.180> around<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.720> it's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
intensity from those around you it's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
intensity from those around you it's

take<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.079> us<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> every<00:01:40.500> aspect<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> game
