00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
it's really hard this is probably the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
it's really hard this is probably the
worst<00:04:32.400> way<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.850> enter<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> car<00:04:34.080> there's<00:04:34.320> another

mushroom up there cherry thing whatever

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.360 
mushroom up there cherry thing whatever
probably<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.470> worst<00:04:37.680> way<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:37.950> enter<00:04:38.340> a

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
probably the worst way to enter a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.780 
used to at all but whatever every video
shouldn't<00:04:43.350> be<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.590> certainly<00:04:44.460> it'll

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
shouldn't be like this certainly it'll

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.250
