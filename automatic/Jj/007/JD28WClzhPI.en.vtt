00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.810
 in this video we will look at 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.990
 computer crash when out of order 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.620
 video card 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.389
 so now we have a computer 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.400
 on which the video card failed 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.629
 including power to this computer 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.600
 and one of those obvious reasons 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640
 clear factors that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.960
 does not work on the capitol of the video card 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.829
 is that she 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.929
 monitor and no output 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.480
 images that is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.939
 when we turn on the computer 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.059
 on the monitor screen it is completely black and 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.340
 no image comes out 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.110
 what do we do such cases 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.080
 in this case if for example you 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.970
 do computer repair 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.710
 you should have several video cards 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 one video card with zverev a gi 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 who is the section in which it was originally 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.540
 patriotic courses 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.660
 and the second time it is 50 express 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.120
 Here on this NATO on this example, we 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.630
 installed video card with the removal 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.790
 and jeep her 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.110
 and now we will try 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.360
 pull out that old video card yourself 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 convinced the map that we have workers 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.160
 we will try to make it the same 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.030
 time see what happens to us 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 yes, that is, but this is such an obvious one 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.549
 reason when out of action hated 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.020
 cards know what to do what they do 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 usually remembered cards 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.740
 that is, the husband on the video cards is usually 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.020
 there are such here 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.650
 obvious signs for example here 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.160
 and after all from 5 it is necessary 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.980
 when how to say 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.090
 updated explicit they testify 10 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.670
 they indicate that the video card 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 out of order 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.850
 but if you for example electronics 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.940
 its inhabitants 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.390
 overwhelmed but if you do 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.730
 You are interested in electronics. 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.090
 do what 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.369
 and the poet what accessories 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.340
 the most 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.159
 share repair this part may 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.090
 if you donâ€™t train leonidovich to anyone 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.289
 it can do but if for example on 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.659
 the video card came out some kind of cells 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:10.689
 yes myself 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.889
 myself through this video card then this 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.090
 graphics card she 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.840
 not repaired but or repair of the Russian Federation costs 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.759
 very expensive 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.969
 place it is possible to buy a new one 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.279
 video card 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.519
 but usually it is produced exactly 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.199
 installing a new video card 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.309
 but new components 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.239
 so let us put in this 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:33.989
 connector 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.760
 video card and see what 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.589
 will happen 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 when installing another saw something like working 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.629
 the people of the connector residents 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.839
 so connect monitor 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.930
 for 1 now let's turn on 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.129
 this computer 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.269
 we'll see what happens with this 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.589
 the video card started working 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.490
 his task is spiegel 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.899
 on the monitor 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:02.899
 and here we we see what appears 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.509
 appears in the EU 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:06.799
 her computer 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.799
 loading successfully 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.569
 there is a street militia all information 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 the monitor went 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.729
 here we see this information 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:19.799
 computer 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.519
 that is, and here it is such a Samara 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.730
 itself often encountered 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.880
 problems when 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.220
 just the video card fails 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.460
 or is there some kind of capacitor 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.940
 be at the protective video card 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.940
 swell off the initiators either 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.660
 some kind of overheating or like me 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.669
 spoke simply 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.789
 for example toyota sleep in boys 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.299
 on the video card it burns in russia but also 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.039
 here already 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.509
 such are chosen 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.319
 but repair options are faster tribal replacement 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.829
 fully component in 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.929
 Mostly used if 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:58.409
 costly 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.689
 video card 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.109
 however when there 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.790
 game darling 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.040
 you can try this video card 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.469
 do a lot of the scope of this course we do not 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.639
 are considering 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.649
 it is repair parts and we 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:11.929
 are considering 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.979
 we have with you a replacement for her like us very quickly and 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.949
 easily determines the failure of this or 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.829
 other components so 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.889
 and which ones 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.449
 factors may still indicate 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.409
 tom that 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.610
 your graphics card is out of order 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.879
 be 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.180
 when changing permission 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.610
 on monitoring example there s1000d 4 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.490
 at length 700 what is your son at 800 600 when me 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.990
 this is the screen resolution 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.400
 you appear on the monitor 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.580
 different and even and incomprehensible given 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.850
 factor alas item class can 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.780
 testify that 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.970
 the video card doesn't work either 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.499
 some incomprehensible 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:58.490
 but m during the game basically that is 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.780
 percentage all the reasons are related to 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.150
 video cards 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.070
 exactly what are associated with 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.120
 display of information that is 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.089
 examples when the monitor is there once 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:11.419
 changes and commitment to their 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.819
 transition again cleft another 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.300
 it happens very often 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.740
 that's it i'm well that's it basically it 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.100
 such a factor that the video card burns and 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.800
 no image is transmitted at all 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.860
 In case there is a problem, you have a date. 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.500
 just take for me for example 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.920
 graphics card how we did it here 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.990
 three test your computer enjoyable 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.430
 new video card if the reason goes away means 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.419
 respectively, the reason was this 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.840
 you just change and the video card thereby 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.840
 computer starts ok 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.509
 nato such are the main reasons 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.969
 such major factors 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.159
 when exactly did it fail 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.360
 as
