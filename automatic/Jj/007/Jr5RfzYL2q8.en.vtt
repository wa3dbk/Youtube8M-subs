and as a secondary emotion you'll feel

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
and as a secondary emotion you'll feel
your<00:00:45.270> hips<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:46.260> only<00:00:46.500> exploding<00:00:47.129> upward<00:00:47.610> but

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
your hips not only exploding upward but

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
your hips not only exploding upward but
inward<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.629> setting<00:00:48.989> back<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
inward because you're setting back so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.459 
inward because you're setting back so
far<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:51.780> something<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> have

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
far it's really something that you have

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
far it's really something that you have
to<00:00:52.590> feel<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.309> takes<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.699> bit<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to feel for it takes a little bit of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.270 
to feel for it takes a little bit of
balance<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.379> always<00:00:55.559> told<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
balance but I was always told that if I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.479 
balance but I was always told that if I
was<00:00:56.430> struggling<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> feel<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
was struggling to have that feel of

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.950 
was struggling to have that feel of
learning<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> push<00:00:59.760> out<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.539> try<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> elevate

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
learning to push out to try to elevate

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
learning to push out to try to elevate
my<00:01:01.289> big<00:01:01.469> toe<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.190> lift<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> up

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
my big toe a little bit just lift it up

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.030 
my big toe a little bit just lift it up
in<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.879> shoe<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:04.199> focus<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:04.710> pushing

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
in my shoe and really focus I'm pushing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.640 
in my shoe and really focus I'm pushing
to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> sides<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.760> feet<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.590> imagine<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to the sides of my feet and imagine a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.219 
to the sides of my feet and imagine a
line<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> floor<00:01:08.460> being<00:01:09.090> drawn<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> just

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
line in the floor being drawn and just

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
line in the floor being drawn and just
trying<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> separate<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.280> line<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
trying to separate that line in the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.859 
trying to separate that line in the
floor<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.680> outward<00:01:13.680> motion<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:15.270> really

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
floor like outward motion and it really

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.679 
floor like outward motion and it really
helped<00:01:16.140> me<00:01:17.210> definitely<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> greatest

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
helped me definitely not the greatest

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.800 
helped me definitely not the greatest

the muscle groups secondly in the raw
squad<00:01:30.380> my<00:01:31.380> concentration<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.369> more<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:33.540> soon

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
squad my concentration is more as soon

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
squad my concentration is more as soon
as<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> hit<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> bottom<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.920> try<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.700> keep<00:01:35.939> my

feet<00:01:36.900> balanced<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.939> thing<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.210> can

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
feet balanced because one thing that can

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.420 
feet balanced because one thing that can
really<00:01:39.450> happen<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> raw<00:01:40.470> squat<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
really happen in the raw squat as you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.120 
really happen in the raw squat as you
can<00:01:41.790> spring<00:01:42.119> forward<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> try<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.860> keep<00:01:44.070> my

whenever<00:01:49.860> I'm<00:01:50.220> coming<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.450> first<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
whenever I'm coming up the first thing I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.700 
whenever I'm coming up the first thing I
think<00:01:52.079> about<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:53.000> chest<00:01:54.000> elevation<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.780> then

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
think about is chest elevation and then

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.800 
think about is chest elevation and then
it's<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.460> downward<00:01:56.909> motion<00:01:56.939> through<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> floor

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it's a downward motion through the floor

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's a downward motion through the floor
because<00:01:58.500> you're<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.979> wide<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.509> you're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
because you're not so wide and you're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.300 
because you're not so wide and you're
not<00:02:00.899> using<00:02:01.110> leverage<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.799> much<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> are

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
not using leverage as much as you are

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.469 
not using leverage as much as you are
just<00:02:03.210> force<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> raw<00:02:05.280> squat<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
just force so in the raw squat I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
just force so in the raw squat I
definitely<00:02:07.409> think<00:02:08.009> about<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> downward

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
definitely think about the downward

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.240 
definitely think about the downward
pressure<00:02:09.209> through<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.690> heels<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.259> think<00:02:11.069> about

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
pressure through my heels I think about

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.250 
pressure through my heels I think about
elevating<00:02:11.640> my<00:02:11.790> chest

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
elevating my chest

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.110 
elevating my chest
and<00:02:12.379> using<00:02:12.650> myself<00:02:12.950> as<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.310> spring<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.909> try<00:02:14.060> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and using myself as a spring to try to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.259 
and using myself as a spring to try to
uncoil<00:02:14.620> each<00:02:15.620> wat<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.519> more<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.879> technique

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
uncoil each wat it's more of a technique

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.880 
uncoil each wat it's more of a technique
and<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> leverage<00:02:17.780> movement<00:02:18.230> you're<00:02:18.650> driving

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
and a leverage movement you're driving

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.850 
and a leverage movement you're driving
apart<00:02:19.370> hope<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.000> covered<00:02:20.510> your<00:02:20.629> question<00:02:21.049> if

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
apart hope this covered your question if

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.679 
apart hope this covered your question if
not<00:02:22.069> shoot<00:02:22.819> us<00:02:22.909> another<00:02:23.120> one<00:02:23.209> I'll<00:02:23.450> try<00:02:23.629> to

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
not shoot us another one I'll try to

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.290 
not shoot us another one I'll try to
answer<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.989> for<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.200> then
