different<00:00:27.869> handles<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.529> essentially<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
different handles on but essentially to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.510 
different handles on but essentially to
see<00:00:29.400> involve<00:00:29.730> insight<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:31.160> what<00:00:32.160> will<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.369> this

see involve insight so what will do this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700 
see involve insight so what will do this
will<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> levers<00:00:33.870> handle

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
will get that will get the levers handle

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.750 
will get that will get the levers handle
stripped<00:00:34.950> off<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:36.180> started<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.760> one

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
stripped off this and get started so one

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.680 
stripped off this and get started so one
of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> things<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.120> difficult<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.600> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of the things that's difficult with this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.240 
of the things that's difficult with this
valve<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.050> knowing<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
valve is knowing how to get into the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.970 
valve is knowing how to get into the
valve<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> start<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.770> said

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
valve to start with and as I said

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
valve to start with and as I said
there's<00:00:44.160> different<00:00:44.190> nobody<00:00:44.850> intrument

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
there's different nobody intrument

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.760 
there's different nobody intrument
handle<00:00:45.539> arrangements<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.469> there's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
handle arrangements in this but there's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190 
handle arrangements in this but there's
nothing<00:00:47.039> obvious<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.700> easy<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:49.020> how

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
nothing obvious not easy way to see how

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.220 
nothing obvious not easy way to see how
to<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.500> into<00:00:49.770> however<00:00:50.700> Louie<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.660> he<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> way

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
to get into however Louie and he the way

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.080 
to get into however Louie and he the way
to<00:00:52.289> start<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.980> strip<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> valve<00:00:53.640> down<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to start to strip this valve down is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.580 
to start to strip this valve down is
this<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.390> drop<00:00:54.600> screw<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.199> behind<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
this like drop screw in here behind the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
this like drop screw in here behind the
handle<00:00:55.920> socially<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> said

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
handle socially just like you said

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.090 
handle socially just like you said
removing<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> handle<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:58.350> these<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.039> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
removing the handle now these can be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
removing the handle now these can be
tight<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.600> old

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
tight so what we really need is an old

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
tight so what we really need is an old
rag<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.890> something<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
rag and something like that's just a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
rag and something like that's just a
grip<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> grip<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> handle<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.530> don't

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
grip that grip the handle so we don't

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
grip that grip the handle so we don't
damage<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> chrome<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> that's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
damage the chrome and that's it that's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
damage the chrome and that's it that's
it<00:01:07.290> release<00:01:07.590> note<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> handle<00:01:08.580> should

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it release note so the handle should

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
it release note so the handle should
come<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.650> here<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.510> ever<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.200> answer<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
come off here and as ever the answer is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
come off here and as ever the answer is
always<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.070> lis<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.939> way<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.180> come

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
always to lis think so the way they come

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.190 
always to lis think so the way they come
and<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.710> come<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> know

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and they really come out and so you know

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
and they really come out and so you know
how<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> reassemble<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.670> here's<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> drop

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
how to reassemble it here's the drop

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.300 
how to reassemble it here's the drop
screw<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.759> formal<00:01:24.799> formal<00:01:25.799> allen

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
screw here and so formal formal allen

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.289 
screw here and so formal formal allen
key<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> need<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
key you need for that

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.230 
key you need for that
and<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.659> he's<00:01:27.869> releasing<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
and it's just he's releasing that and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.490 
and it's just he's releasing that and
that<00:01:30.240> takes<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> grub<00:01:30.869> screw<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that takes the grub screw it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.640 
that takes the grub screw it
yeah<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> take<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.049> top<00:01:34.320> cap

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
yeah and then when you take the top cap

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.060 
yeah and then when you take the top cap
off<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> any<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.079> there's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> fuzzy<00:01:37.860> drive

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
off and any here there's a fuzzy drive

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.109 
off and any here there's a fuzzy drive
screw<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.369> allows<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
screw in here and this allows the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.060 
screw in here and this allows the
temperature<00:01:46.670> control<00:01:47.670> knob<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> come<00:01:48.420> off

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
temperature control knob to come off

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.760 
temperature control knob to come off
it's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> temperature<00:01:50.549> control<00:01:50.880> nova<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> then

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it's a temperature control nova and then

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's a temperature control nova and then
the<00:01:52.890> next<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.520> cover<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the next thing is this cover and the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.490 
the next thing is this cover and the
should<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.130> lift<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.820> real<00:02:00.210> easily<00:02:00.500> that's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
should just lift off real easily that's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.710 
should just lift off real easily that's
held<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:02.250> planes<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.570> one

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
held on with these planes here now one

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.030 
held on with these planes here now one
nice<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.200> need<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.440> be<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> particular

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
nice is really need to be a particular

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.910 
nice is really need to be a particular
attention<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> stop<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
attention to here this is a stop for the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
attention to here this is a stop for the
for<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.790> full<00:02:09.000> leaver

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
for the full leaver

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.090 
for the full leaver
so<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> must<00:02:10.080> make<00:02:10.229> sure<00:02:10.260> that<00:02:10.590> goes<00:02:10.710> back<00:02:10.950> in

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
so you must make sure that goes back in

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.120 
so you must make sure that goes back in
the<00:02:11.220> same<00:02:11.400> place<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.920> where<00:02:14.070> we

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the same place now the this is where we

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.150 
the same place now the this is where we
come<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.430> using<00:02:14.730> using<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.390> thing<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:16.350> this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
come to using using this thing that this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.130 
come to using using this thing that this
nut<00:02:17.520> here<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.150> really<00:02:18.450> tight<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.930> some

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
nut here can be really tight in some

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.030 
nut here can be really tight in some
cases<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.710> off<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.290> can

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
cases to get off and so there you can

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.420 
cases to get off and so there you can
grip<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.760> with<00:02:24.440> something<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.710> but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
grip it with something like this but

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.130 
grip it with something like this but
once<00:02:26.640> again<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.390> where<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.690> need<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.960> rag

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
once again this is where we need the rag

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.100 
once again this is where we need the rag
to<00:02:28.470> go<00:02:28.590> down<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.950> first<00:02:29.250> however<00:02:30.110> if

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
to go down and it first however if

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.150 
to go down and it first however if
you've<00:02:31.260> got<00:02:31.380> something<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.920> won't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you've got something like this you won't

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.680 
you've got something like this you won't
damage<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.700> cruel<00:02:32.940> let's<00:02:33.720> go<00:02:33.870> around<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.530> so

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.760 

just<00:02:39.690> tension<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.170> little<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:46.320> was

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
just tension a little bit and it was

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.940 
just tension a little bit and it was
like<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.820> unscrew<00:02:48.180> this

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
like this and it you can unscrew this

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:01.750 
like this and it you can unscrew this
like<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.100> plan<00:02:50.310> set<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.790> sit<00:02:51.120> released<00:02:51.390> a

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.660 

long<00:03:02.760> thread<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:07.920> that's<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.220> cover<00:03:08.489> off

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
long thread and so that's that cover off

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.530 
long thread and so that's that cover off
I<00:03:10.100> know<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.340> I've<00:03:11.400> got<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.030> temperature

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
I know that I've got the the temperature

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.180 
I know that I've got the the temperature
stop<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:12.959> as<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:13.320> must<00:03:13.470> remember<00:03:13.709> the

stop as as here we must remember the

exactly which we that was lying when

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.890 
exactly which we that was lying when
it's<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.830> goes<00:03:17.670> over<00:03:17.910> here<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.660> now<00:03:18.840> we

it's in here goes over here and now we

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.860 
it's in here goes over here and now we
come<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.830> brass<00:03:20.420> retaining<00:03:21.420> nut<00:03:21.630> that

holds the that holds the cartridge
itself<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.900> place<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.700> there's<00:03:27.690> two<00:03:27.840> free

itself in place and there's two free
ways<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.350> get<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.650> off<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.070> know<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.280> can

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
ways to get this off you know you can

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.770 
ways to get this off you know you can
put<00:03:29.580> something<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.000> here<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.180> couple<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.570> bars

put something in here a couple of bars

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.759 
put something in here a couple of bars
in<00:03:30.989> here<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.290> try<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.100> try<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.459> slack<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.000> or

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
in here to try and try on slack in it or

affected<00:03:34.769> eclipse<00:03:35.100> or<00:03:35.250> something<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.580> really

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
affected eclipse or something is really

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.160 
affected eclipse or something is really
going<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.030> careful<00:03:36.360> not<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> shine<00:03:36.750> kind<00:03:37.019> of

going to be careful not to shine kind of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.229 
going to be careful not to shine kind of
damage<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.610> frankly<00:03:38.940> easier

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
damage it and this is frankly easier

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.210 
damage it and this is frankly easier
done<00:03:39.510> when<00:03:40.110> it's<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> wall<00:03:40.860> rather<00:03:41.100> than

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
done when it's on the wall rather than

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.310 
done when it's on the wall rather than
on<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.489> bench<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:41.910> I'm<00:03:42.510> gonna<00:03:42.690> try<00:03:42.930> angular's

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
on the bench but I'm gonna try angular's

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:53.660 
on the bench but I'm gonna try angular's
apart<00:03:43.830> Leslie<00:03:51.350> that's<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.530> released<00:03:52.860> as

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
apart Leslie that's it released as

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.530 

and<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:59.310> here<00:03:59.520> there's<00:03:59.760> an<00:03:59.850> island<00:04:00.000> washer

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
and in here there's an island washer

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.790 
and in here there's an island washer
which<00:04:01.290> I'll<00:04:01.500> mention<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.490> moment<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.880> -<00:04:03.120> and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
which I'll mention in a moment of - and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.050 
which I'll mention in a moment of - and
here's<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.860> cottage<00:04:05.280> itself<00:04:05.670> actually<00:04:05.850> has

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
here's the cottage itself actually has

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.760 
here's the cottage itself actually has
keys<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.450> get<00:04:06.630> me<00:04:06.750> cartridge<00:04:07.110> out<00:04:07.230> there

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
keys to get me cartridge out there

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.330 
keys to get me cartridge out there
rather<00:04:07.980> usefully<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:09.420> there's<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.440> locating

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
rather usefully that there's a locating

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.270 
rather usefully that there's a locating
pin<00:04:11.490> here<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.470> what<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:14.010> there's<00:04:14.220> a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
pin here and what we can do is there's a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.130 
pin here and what we can do is there's a
slot<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.820> here<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.180> get<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> screwdriver<00:04:15.660> and

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
slot and here to get a screwdriver and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.350 
slot and here to get a screwdriver and
to<00:04:16.260> leave<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:16.650> forward<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.000> we<00:04:18.209> just

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
to leave it at forward and so we just

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.590 
to leave it at forward and so we just
need<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.630> leave<00:04:19.050> it<00:04:19.200> nice<00:04:20.160> there's<00:04:21.120> also<00:04:21.300> one

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
need to leave it nice there's also one

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.020 
need to leave it nice there's also one
here<00:04:21.630> need<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.290> get<00:04:22.440> bit<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.740> site<00:04:23.040> that's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
here need to get bit in the site that's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.960 
here need to get bit in the site that's
it<00:04:24.530> also<00:04:25.530> they<00:04:25.740> should<00:04:25.800> just<00:04:26.100> now<00:04:26.280> pull<00:04:26.640> it<00:04:26.670> and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
it also they should just now pull it and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.550 
it also they should just now pull it and
so<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.540> that's<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.960> cartridge<00:04:28.380> out

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
so that's it that's the cartridge out

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.360 
so that's it that's the cartridge out
fairly<00:04:29.280> straightforward<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:31.040> we<00:04:32.040> have<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
fairly straightforward and we have the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.850 
fairly straightforward and we have the
