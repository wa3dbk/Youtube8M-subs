and so that one's piece I split it
I<00:01:05.430> cut<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> 45<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.670> center<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
I cut a 45 right down the center to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.310 
I cut a 45 right down the center to
split<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> thing<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.420> half<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.869> only<00:01:10.080> have

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
split the thing in half so I only have

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420 
split the thing in half so I only have
to<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> cut<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:12.470> how<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to make that cut once but how this is is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
to make that cut once but how this is is
uh<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.210> cut<00:01:20.060> cut<00:01:21.060> back<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.450> 45<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
uh this is cut cut back on 45 to the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
uh this is cut cut back on 45 to the
bottom<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.450> cut<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
bottom and then this was cut back to the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
bottom and then this was cut back to the
bottom<00:01:25.530> too<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.479> when<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.509> fit<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.080> there

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
bottom too so when you fit them in there

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.190 
bottom too so when you fit them in there
they<00:01:28.380> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> overlap<00:01:28.799> each<00:01:29.340> other<00:01:29.659> and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.890 
about it well I lied I figured while was
sawing<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:55.920> work<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.370> I'd<00:04:56.690> go<00:04:57.690> ahead<00:04:57.810> and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
sawing and work and I'd go ahead and

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.660 
sawing and work and I'd go ahead and
push<00:04:58.140> myself<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.680> little<00:04:58.860> bit<00:04:58.980> further<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.580> I

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
push myself a little bit further and I

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.300 
push myself a little bit further and I
went<00:04:59.910> ahead<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.410> finished<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.770> floorboard

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
went ahead and finished the floorboard

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.120 
went ahead and finished the floorboard
for<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:03.440> truck<00:05:04.440> while<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.710> was<00:05:04.950> at<00:05:05.100> it<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:07.130> I

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
for the truck while I was at it and I

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.860 
for the truck while I was at it and I
went<00:05:08.610> ahead<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:08.940> cut<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.150> battery<00:05:09.330> hole<00:05:09.660> out

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
went ahead and cut the battery hole out

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.180 
went ahead and cut the battery hole out
on<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.110> truck<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:12.740> didn't<00:05:13.740> know<00:05:13.830> if<00:05:13.890> I<00:05:14.010> wanted

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
on the truck I didn't know if I wanted

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.820 
on the truck I didn't know if I wanted
it<00:05:14.460> or<00:05:14.610> not<00:05:14.670> on<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.180> car<00:05:15.420> but<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.960> probably

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
it or not on the car but I probably

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.400 
it or not on the car but I probably
won't<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.460> don't<00:05:18.000> know<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.330> do<00:05:18.720> I'll<00:05:18.960> do<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.230> later

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
won't I don't know I do I'll do it later

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
won't I don't know I do I'll do it later
but<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:20.780> did<00:05:21.780> see<00:05:22.620> if<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.800> liked<00:05:23.040> it<00:05:23.130> now<00:05:23.280> there

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
but I did see if I liked it now there

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.950 
but I did see if I liked it now there
make<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> little<00:05:23.790> steel<00:05:24.060> plate<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.360> goes<00:05:24.660> over

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
make a little steel plate that goes over

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.560 
make a little steel plate that goes over
the<00:05:25.110> thing<00:05:25.350> but<00:05:25.730> one<00:05:26.730> more<00:05:26.880> thing<00:05:26.910> on<00:05:27.330> this

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
the thing but one more thing on this

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.170 
the thing but one more thing on this
thing<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:28.130> this<00:05:29.130> floorboards<00:05:29.670> a<00:05:29.760> little<00:05:30.060> bit

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
thing is this floorboards a little bit

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.540 
thing is this floorboards a little bit
different<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.750> had<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.200> from<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.100> pattern<00:05:32.460> I

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
different I had to from the pattern I

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.980 
different I had to from the pattern I
had<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.820> change<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.210> other<00:05:33.420> a<00:05:33.540> little<00:05:33.750> bit

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
had to change the other a little bit

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.100 
had to change the other a little bit
because<00:05:34.790> 28<00:05:35.790> in<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.740> early<00:05:37.740> 29<00:05:38.220> had<00:05:38.580> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
because 28 in the early 29 had the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.340 
because 28 in the early 29 had the
emergency<00:05:40.110> brake<00:05:40.350> in<00:05:41.300> front<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.600> shifter

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
emergency brake in front of the shifter

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.590 
emergency brake in front of the shifter
in<00:05:43.920> that<00:05:44.070> 29<00:05:44.520> in<00:05:44.670> mine<00:05:44.820> was<00:05:44.970> on<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.210> side<00:05:45.390> so

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
in that 29 in mine was on the side so

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.530 
in that 29 in mine was on the side so
the<00:05:45.690> pattern<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.170> got<00:05:46.820> had<00:05:47.820> it<00:05:48.000> for<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.240> front

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
the pattern I got had it for the front

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.740 
the pattern I got had it for the front
so<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.230> had<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.920> just<00:05:50.270> cut<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.360> back<00:05:51.510> a<00:05:51.570> little

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
so I had to just cut it back a little

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.810 
so I had to just cut it back a little
bit

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
bit

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.170 
bit
that's<00:05:53.820> about<00:05:53.970> it<00:05:54.830> anyhow<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.490> really<00:05:57.000> it

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
that's about it anyhow this is really it

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.640 
that's about it anyhow this is really it
now<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.390> get<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.750> take<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.930> break<00:05:58.170> it's<00:05:58.410> getting

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
now I get to take a break it's getting

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.750 
now I get to take a break it's getting
late<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.570> my<00:06:00.570> ribs<00:06:00.840> are<00:06:01.020> starting<00:06:01.380> to<00:06:01.500> show<00:06:02.430> so

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
late and my ribs are starting to show so

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.310 
late and my ribs are starting to show so
I'm<00:06:02.910> gonna<00:06:03.060> get<00:06:03.270> something<00:06:03.450> neat<00:06:03.720> I<00:06:03.930> guess

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
I'm gonna get something neat I guess

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.770
