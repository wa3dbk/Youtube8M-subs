surgical or gap is all this time I'm

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.740 
surgical or gap is all this time I'm
going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> one<00:00:08.670> doing<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.150> attack<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
going to be the one doing the attack and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.320 
going to be the one doing the attack and
this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.679> be<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.400> modification<00:00:11.880> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
this is going to be on a modification of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.120 
this is going to be on a modification of
a<00:00:12.630> known<00:00:13.139> internet-based<00:00:13.559> called<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
a known internet-based called the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.580 
a known internet-based called the
general<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.269> probably<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.139> base<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
general so you probably know the base it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.950 
general so you probably know the base it
looks<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.310> bit<00:00:17.430> different<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
looks a bit different on this one on the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.960 
looks a bit different on this one on the
original<00:00:19.680> general<00:00:20.100> base<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.609> tests

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
original general base there are tests

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.150 
original general base there are tests
are<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.720> closed<00:00:22.080> compartment<00:00:22.470> somebody

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
are here in closed compartment somebody

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519 
are here in closed compartment somebody
like<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.019> totally

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
like that but this one is totally

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.849 
like that but this one is totally
different<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:27.750> major<00:00:28.019> part<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
different and the major part that is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
different and the major part that is
different<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> original<00:00:30.210> base

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
different is that in the original base

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.069 
different is that in the original base
their<00:00:31.109> bombs<00:00:31.410> over<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.009> over<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
their bombs over here and over here and

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.010 
their bombs over here and over here and
another<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.190> makes<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.020> way

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
another to here which makes it way

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
another to here which makes it way
easier<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.250> hogs<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.180> can

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
easier to get with hogs because you can

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.630 
easier to get with hogs because you can
count<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.050> hugs<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.460> direction

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
count with your hugs from this direction

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540 
count with your hugs from this direction
and<00:00:42.090> those<00:00:42.480> buns<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.140> gonna<00:00:43.320> work<00:00:43.620> first

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and those buns are not gonna work first

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
and those buns are not gonna work first
of<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.789> they're<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.180> detonate<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.750> bombs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of all they're gonna detonate the bombs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
of all they're gonna detonate the bombs
over<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.469> when<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> Swiss

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
over here when they get to the Swiss

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
over here when they get to the Swiss
star<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> sing<00:00:48.390> goes<00:00:48.600> from<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> other<00:00:49.140> side

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
star and sing goes from the other side

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.639 
star and sing goes from the other side
so<00:00:49.739> i<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.340> videos<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.329> website<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:52.379> the

bass beat section showing how to beat
this<00:00:54.510> original<00:00:55.140> base<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.329> way

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this original base but this one is way

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.450 
this original base but this one is way
different<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> bombs<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.800> located

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
different because the bombs are located

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.779 
different because the bombs are located
in<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.120> area<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.230> area<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.520> i

attack is going to be messed up with so
many<00:03:04.590> hogs<00:03:04.860> dying<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.990> what<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.020> decided<00:03:07.140> doing

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
many hogs dying so what I decided doing

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.150 
many hogs dying so what I decided doing
is<00:03:08.160> using<00:03:08.760> those<00:03:09.660> bound<00:03:10.020> locations<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.950> my

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
is using those bound locations to my

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.090 
is using those bound locations to my
advantage<00:03:11.960> they're<00:03:12.960> located<00:03:13.500> over<00:03:13.740> here<00:03:13.770> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
advantage they're located over here and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.650 
advantage they're located over here and
if<00:03:14.490> i'm<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.910> count<00:03:15.150> from<00:03:15.390> this

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
if i'm going to count from this

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.120 
if i'm going to count from this
direction<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:17.730> direction<00:03:18.860> those<00:03:19.860> bombs

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
direction and this direction those bombs

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.430 
direction and this direction those bombs
are<00:03:20.310> not<00:03:20.610> going<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.060> most<00:03:21.450> likely<00:03:21.959> i<00:03:21.990> mean

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
are not going to be most likely i mean

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.740 
are not going to be most likely i mean
it<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.920> happen<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.550> some<00:03:23.640> occasions<00:03:24.270> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
it can happen in some occasions that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.330 
it can happen in some occasions that
they're<00:03:24.959> going<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> blow<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.500> together<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.130> in

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
they're going to blow up together but in

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.100 
they're going to blow up together but in
most<00:03:26.610> cases<00:03:26.760> they're<00:03:27.300> not<00:03:27.480> gonna<00:03:27.630> work<00:03:27.930> from

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
most cases they're not gonna work from

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.190 
most cases they're not gonna work from
this<00:03:28.320> direction<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.980> only<00:03:29.670> one<00:03:29.880> will<00:03:30.120> blow<00:03:31.020> up

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
this direction and only one will blow up

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.070 
this direction and only one will blow up
so<00:03:31.440> if<00:03:31.650> i<00:03:31.800> use<00:03:31.980> my<00:03:32.220> heels<00:03:32.459> falls<00:03:32.790> over<00:03:33.660> here<00:03:33.930> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
so if i use my heels falls over here and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.170 
so if i use my heels falls over here and
over<00:03:34.470> here<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.010> gonna<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.370> really<00:03:35.640> good<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
over here it's gonna be really good and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.720 
over here it's gonna be really good and
most<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.410> hoax<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:37.950> not<00:03:38.130> all<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.340> them<00:03:38.580> are

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
most of the hoax if not all of them are

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.900 
most of the hoax if not all of them are
going<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:38.940> survive<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.280> varied<00:03:41.280> heal<00:03:41.490> spell<00:03:41.790> is

breakers and gonna kill them so this

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.500 
breakers and gonna kill them so this
wizard<00:04:22.340> actually<00:04:23.340> saves<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:24.000> wall<00:04:24.270> breaker

so this is a report

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.709 
so this is a report
the<00:04:25.949> part<00:04:26.249> of<00:04:26.520> this<00:04:26.879> one<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.539> get<00:04:27.659> a

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:27.719 
the part of this one and you get a

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:29.480 
the part of this one and you get a
notice<00:04:28.139> those<00:04:28.379> things<00:04:28.409> you<00:04:28.800> gotta<00:04:29.009> know<00:04:29.249> this

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
notice those things you gotta know this

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.059 
notice those things you gotta know this
where<00:04:30.389> you're<00:04:30.689> dropping<00:04:31.199> your<00:04:31.229> wall<00:04:31.650> breakers

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
where you're dropping your wall breakers

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.830 
where you're dropping your wall breakers
so<00:04:32.400> they<00:04:32.669> won't<00:04:32.909> feel<00:04:33.090> breaking<00:04:33.509> the<00:04:33.629> world

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
so they won't feel breaking the world

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.290 
so they won't feel breaking the world
one<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.949> most<00:04:35.310> most<00:04:35.669> common<00:04:36.180> mistakes

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
one of the most most common mistakes

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.249 
one of the most most common mistakes
that<00:04:37.050> people<00:04:38.039> are<00:04:38.520> doing<00:04:38.939> is<00:04:39.120> failing<00:04:39.840> with

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
that people are doing is failing with

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.529 
that people are doing is failing with
the<00:04:40.379> wall<00:04:40.560> breakers<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:42.150> can<00:04:42.389> actually

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
the wall breakers and this can actually

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.379 
the wall breakers and this can actually
cause<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.620> 3-star<00:04:44.189> if<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.849> can<00:04:45.120> be<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
cause you the 3-star if you can be the

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.089 
cause you the 3-star if you can be the
difference<00:04:45.509> between<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.139> three<00:04:46.409> star<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.949> a

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
difference between a three star and a

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.390 
difference between a three star and a
two<00:04:47.310> star<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.879> make<00:04:48.810> sure<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:49.169> pay<00:04:49.349> attention

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
two star so make sure you pay attention

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.249 
two star so make sure you pay attention
to<00:04:50.400> your<00:04:50.520> world<00:04:50.729> records<00:04:51.150> path<00:04:51.449> where<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
to your world records path where you

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.559 
to your world records path where you
release<00:04:52.680> them<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.189> of<00:04:53.639> course<00:04:53.939> the<00:04:54.090> timing

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
release them and of course the timing

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.379 
release them and of course the timing
make<00:04:55.110> sure<00:04:55.139> something<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.740> shielding<00:04:56.389> make

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
make sure something is shielding make

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.260 
make sure something is shielding make
sure<00:04:57.599> that<00:04:57.900> they're<00:04:58.169> not<00:04:58.409> going<00:04:58.650> into<00:04:59.270> splash

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
sure that they're not going into splash

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.899 
sure that they're not going into splash
damage<00:05:00.569> fire<00:05:00.990> for<00:05:01.710> example<00:05:02.129> mortars<00:05:02.610> and

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
damage fire for example mortars and

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.629 
damage fire for example mortars and
waste<00:05:03.779> hours<00:05:04.169> so<00:05:04.439> you<00:05:04.710> gotta<00:05:04.979> make<00:05:05.189> sure<00:05:05.219> that

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
waste hours so you gotta make sure that

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.290 
waste hours so you gotta make sure that
all<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.479> that<00:05:06.689> is<00:05:07.159> okay<00:05:08.159> before<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.789> get<00:05:09.120> them

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
all of that is okay before you get them

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.980 
all of that is okay before you get them
in<00:05:09.509> and<00:05:10.969> this<00:05:11.969> is<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.180> way<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.389> get<00:05:12.689> three

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
in and this is the way to get three

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.309 
in and this is the way to get three
starts<00:05:13.379> doing<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.069> right<00:05:14.279> things<00:05:14.610> in<00:05:15.319> the

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
starts doing the right things in the

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.119 
starts doing the right things in the
right<00:05:16.469> base<00:05:16.919> so<00:05:18.409> notice<00:05:19.409> that<00:05:19.589> on<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.919> right

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
right base so notice that on the right

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.920 
right base so notice that on the right
most<00:05:20.639> of<00:05:20.819> the<00:05:20.909> whole<00:05:21.089> kit<00:05:21.240> didn't<00:05:21.509> survive

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
most of the whole kit didn't survive

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.339 
most of the whole kit didn't survive
it's<00:05:22.259> it's<00:05:22.919> really<00:05:23.430> rare<00:05:23.669> that<00:05:24.180> such<00:05:25.050> case

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
it's it's really rare that such case

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.800 
it's it's really rare that such case
happens<00:05:25.860> from<00:05:26.189> such<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.550> direction<00:05:26.819> but<00:05:27.360> as<00:05:27.659> you

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
happens from such a direction but as you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.990 
happens from such a direction but as you
can<00:05:27.930> see<00:05:28.110> it<00:05:28.229> does<00:05:28.409> happen<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.069> my<00:05:29.729> hawks

can see it does happen and my hawks

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.790 
can see it does happen and my hawks
don't<00:05:30.300> survive<00:05:30.569> but<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:31.020> still<00:05:31.319> have<00:05:31.379> enough
