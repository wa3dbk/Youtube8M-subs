 came out good today came out a couple of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
 days but good you did not know how to make video 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.250
 because it was a mini story and such and such 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 but well I've put together a couple of news 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 and they make a big news to make a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.109
 video apart I'll teach a few 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.910
 face because a lot of people have 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.710
 asked outside these real posts not 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 I know what and recommend the fakes more 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.960
 they are Felix throughout all of the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 video but good let's go with the official 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 let's go with the real thing before talking about the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 news of remakes announced a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.130
 new pokémon game called the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 band of thieves and the thousand pokemon that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 will go out for nintendo 3ds the game to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.399
 being free is a game of sop that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.469
 what it does is basically promote 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.789
 the next pokemon movie that is a 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.620
 the one that will be released in japan throughout 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.770
 june that pokemon week and the cocoon of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 the destruction of annecy or pokemon or of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.129
 craving and the cocoon of destruction like that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 rather, that is the official title in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.910
 Spanish the protagonists are rivers and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.140
 marilyn the bad guys from the movie that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.359
 they will steal pokemon using the function 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 street part lamented 3ds now that it's a 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.960
 pretty Japanese game but 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.220
 now I do not know very well what is not going 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.170
 gameplay has come out or anything like that 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 be a pair of screen 7 the corocoro 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.820
 last month so I can not say either 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 nothing last the game will activate a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.960
 promotional pikachu for pokemon x 6 well 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 that if you have the game you can get 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 it's epic shock to have the object 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.150
 which makes it boost the special attack 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.140
 in picacho and that is called the ball I do not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 agreement how that object is called but 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.479
 well many people say that under 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.800
 comments will tell 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.780
 we fly with the information now yes of 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.970
 pokemon rugby or mega a statement 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 morimoto officer who is one of the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.220
 developers that is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.290
 developing this pokémon game 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.740
 blond mega and sapphire alpha the remakes of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.060
 young as you well know has said that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.220
 there's going to be a change in the fighting 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.470
 the sixth generation that we saw in pokemon 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 x 6 is to say a change in the competitive 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 fax wat let's see if we're 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.890
 doing a remake will not see pokémons 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.869
 new or a new type or nothing by the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.580
 a priori style because he's talking about 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.500
 that there will be a change in the fighting 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.770
 of the sixth generation we are talking 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 of new attacks on new attacks 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.990
 double type maybe as he did with the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.110
 attacks of 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.970
 to leave a fight for example or now it's 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.710
 that we do not have much idea or maybe instead 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.640
 of a mega evolution now still the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.260
 pokemon alpha only pokemon if the pokemon 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.570
 primal so to speak as if we saw a 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.310
 for example park already in mysterious world 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.350
 the time is that I do not know what he will refer to 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 this mister morimoto but interesting is 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.000
 the less is this publication or 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.070
 what this said is the Lord 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.960
 morimoto we do not know we do not know what 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.400
 type of changes is concerned because 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.560
 now we have only been able to watch a video 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.690
 real or an official video that kidnapped 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.060
 to grow done and to work and the truth is 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.770
 that little thing I do not encourage myself to venture 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.480
 I do not encourage that senna now is that 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.520
 I know very well what he was referring to but in short 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.890
 is what there is and we will see tomorrow 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.450
 Maybe they will say something to the 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.340
 pokemon program is more is that always 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.740
 every Sunday you will see mini minis 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.780
 official information of the remakes but 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.100
 zilch moment you tomorrow 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.020
 I will comment if I see that the news is 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.550
 important I'll make a video and if I see that it 's 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.480
 unimportant or I can make a video 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.430
 I'll make a video and if not then what 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.370
 I will comment on twitter and it is finally 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.950
 we go with a screenshot that this is going to 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.800
 see the following ones that I'm going to put in 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.120
 those that I've probably already planned all 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.590
 face now good now 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.360
 I will comment a little bit above 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.340
 I want you to see this one here is 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.370
 screen seems to be not entered 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.770
 mind is like a 3ds photographed 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.570
 it really seems like it's true but it's 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.490
 the most real I find of those that 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.600
 we have seen so far really and 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.750
 we see it looks fixed luminaire 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.100
 honestly but below you see the map of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.230
 he left in works that now pretty 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 honestly for me young is the region 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.070
 what I like most and at the objective level is 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.660
 the one that most everyone likes but 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.880
 it seems quite real and even not 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.730
 write is that there is a little blue thing to 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.500
 side of the protagonist who is very that 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.270
 obviously so maybe it is 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.370
 official or yes that is a leak 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.650
 Now that nothing is known as I say and 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.730
 also top left you see in 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.170
 the start image of the game in Japanese 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.930
 obviously we talk with the images 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.820
 here you see the three images that are face 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.280
 Obviously lords that pretty cool 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.470
 We can aura or as safir as you like 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.700
 call you see her there we have the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.320
 protagonist very different from what 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.900
 we have seen in the other corner as 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.060
 seen before here we see a leak 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.639
 as the people of the crown said in the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.289
 that we saw that there was a fusion between 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.430
 this is super official that is faith and thing 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.620
 is that everyone says it's faith and that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.800
 in addition that king is removed which is 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.969
 taken from another pokemon I think it's from 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.740
 algae may be now that I do not know but 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.419
 yes I think I think the shadow looks like 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.879
 and it reminds me a lot of the day we're going 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.680
 with another one of real fakes as I say 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.150
 these are cannes filtras dela corocoro is 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.849
 lie even what the fuck is there 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.020
 down to the left a clinic has no 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.569
 nothing to see so this is 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.520
 absolutely fake and finally and the most 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.620
 funny is this that I had said 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.419
 A lot looks at it in two new ways of 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.069
 recognize me yes seriously seriously do you think 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.979
 what is this if it is a day and palkiewicz 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.490
 look at the pokemon pearl covers 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.830
 and pokemon and pokémon diamond decisions 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.080
 that if it 's the same or those that are back and 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.370
 dialogue is no more in physics but this 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.689
 information now is that quite July 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.550
 in these face that have currado 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.719
 quite some there are very cured and 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.580
 then there are these that are totally 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.689
 lies in physics we hope this is 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.310
 information then leave a like a 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.229
