spools are the ideal way forward I think

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.459 
spools are the ideal way forward I think
you<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.239> fit<00:00:49.449> them<00:00:49.570> on<00:00:49.690> all<00:00:49.809> your<00:00:49.989> popular

Shimano and Iowa his website isn't the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.509 
Shimano and Iowa his website isn't the
best<00:00:59.199> in<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.530> world<00:00:59.679> but<00:00:59.980> everything<00:01:00.370> you

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
best in the world but everything you

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.279 
best in the world but everything you
need<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.879> there<00:01:01.179> it<00:01:01.600> shows<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:02.109> all<00:01:02.260> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
need is there it shows you all the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.160 
need is there it shows you all the
different<00:01:02.440> spools<00:01:03.129> I<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:07.360> see<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:07.960> one<00:01:08.140> of

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
different spools I can see that one of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.760 
different spools I can see that one of
those<00:01:08.410> would<00:01:08.679> be<00:01:08.800> ideal<00:01:09.220> for<00:01:09.280> use<00:01:09.700> with<00:01:09.729> braid

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
those would be ideal for use with braid

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.529 
those would be ideal for use with braid
vanish<00:01:11.770> use<00:01:11.950> very<00:01:12.280> light<00:01:12.460> lines<00:01:12.789> and<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:13.300> the

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
vanish use very light lines and so the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.050 
vanish use very light lines and so the
switch<00:01:13.929> from<00:01:14.170> mono<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.590> braid<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.340> very<00:01:15.700> easy

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.460 

I'll<00:01:19.060> be<00:01:19.270> getting<00:01:19.539> one<00:01:19.659> or<00:01:19.690> two<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:20.080> these<00:01:20.170> to
