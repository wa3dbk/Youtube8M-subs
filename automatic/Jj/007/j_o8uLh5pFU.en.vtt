00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a foot on top of them so you wanna stay

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.109 
a foot on top of them so you wanna stay
away<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.840> he<00:01:39.960> starts<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.350> outside<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:42.000> then

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
away then he starts it outside and then

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.639 
away then he starts it outside and then
it<00:01:42.210> goes<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.659> way<00:01:42.780> outside<00:01:43.200> over<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it goes all the way outside over and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.569 
it goes all the way outside over and
over<00:01:43.710> again<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.280> did<00:01:44.340> by<00:01:44.549> accident

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
over again so what I did by accident

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
over again so what I did by accident
with<00:01:45.030> Iran<00:01:45.299> first<00:01:45.899> time<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.170> ran<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.230 
with Iran first time I ran back into the
storm<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.369> basically<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.939> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> do

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
storm so basically what you want to do

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
storm so basically what you want to do
for<00:01:48.360> thunderstorm<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.990> move<00:01:49.829> away<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
boss about 10 yards once you see the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
boss about 10 yards once you see the
pulse<00:01:52.500> run<00:01:53.189> towards<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.670> boss<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.210> then

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
pulse run towards the boss and then

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.330 
pulse run towards the boss and then
you'll<00:01:54.329> avoid<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.899> rest<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.500> easily<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you'll avoid the rest pretty easily and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.429 
you'll avoid the rest pretty easily and
then<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.000> pretty<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.869> phase<00:01:58.110> 2<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then that's pretty much it to phase 2 of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.289 
then that's pretty much it to phase 2 of
this<00:01:58.710> fight<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.850> go<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.210> the

whichever<00:02:23.549> boss<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:24.000> leave<00:02:24.150> less<00:02:24.420> they're

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
whichever boss you leave less they're

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.380 
whichever boss you leave less they're
gonna<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.409> shadow<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.069> weave<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.849> pulses

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
gonna get a shadow a weave that pulses

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.300 
gonna get a shadow a weave that pulses
in<00:02:27.540> stacks<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.409> this<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.590> basically<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:29.010> burn

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
in stacks so this is basically a burn

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.649 
in stacks so this is basically a burn
phase<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.790> become<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.269> fast<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.599> possible

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
phase you become as fast as possible

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.720 
phase you become as fast as possible
it's<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> same<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.829> no<00:02:32.280> matter<00:02:32.459> which<00:02:32.640> order

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it's the same for no matter which order

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.580 
it's the same for no matter which order
you<00:02:33.030> actually<00:02:33.359> kill<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.569> boss<00:02:33.720> isn't<00:02:34.019> but

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you actually kill the boss isn't but

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.809 
you actually kill the boss isn't but
this<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:34.829> pretty<00:02:34.980> much<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.340> think<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.670> easiest

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
this is pretty much I think the easiest

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.390 
this is pretty much I think the easiest
order<00:02:36.359> so<00:02:37.049> far<00:02:37.379> because<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.769> last<00:02:37.890> guy<00:02:38.129> just

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
order so far because the last guy just

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.920 
order so far because the last guy just
heals<00:02:38.609> himself<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.299> can<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.510> steal<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
heals himself and you can just steal the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.080 
heals himself and you can just steal the
heel<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.349> uses<00:02:41.010> water<00:02:41.189> bolts<00:02:41.609> it's<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.879> even

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
heel and uses water bolts it's not even

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.839 
heel and uses water bolts it's not even
