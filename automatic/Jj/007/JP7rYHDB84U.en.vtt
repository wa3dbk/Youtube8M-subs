00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.170 
different characters you can use them at
different<00:02:18.830> times<00:02:19.220> throughout<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.760> game<00:02:19.790> like

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
different times throughout the game like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.550 
different times throughout the game like
they<00:02:20.269> have<00:02:20.420> more<00:02:20.629> than<00:02:20.780> one<00:02:20.840> use<00:02:21.200> for<00:02:21.230> once

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
they have more than one use for once

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.020 
they have more than one use for once
it's<00:02:21.739> used<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:22.099> can't<00:02:22.310> use<00:02:22.459> them<00:02:22.610> later<00:02:22.760> on

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
it's used you can't use them later on

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.720 
it's used you can't use them later on
that<00:02:23.989> round<00:02:24.230> yeah<00:02:24.440> yeah<00:02:24.799> it's<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:25.459> scrape

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
that round yeah yeah it's just scrape

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.699 
that round yeah yeah it's just scrape
this<00:02:25.940> nice<00:02:26.209> yeah<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.750> need<00:02:27.140> four<00:02:27.470> people

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
this nice yeah you need four people

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.530 
this nice yeah you need four people
because<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.220> well<00:02:28.879> it's<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> three<00:02:29.239> or<00:02:29.330> four

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
because it's well it's a three or four

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.470 
because it's well it's a three or four
player<00:02:30.110> game<00:02:30.140> but<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:32.180> primarily<00:02:32.780> auction

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
player game but it's primarily auction

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.660 
player game but it's primarily auction
is<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.140> mechanic

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
is the mechanic

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.059 
is the mechanic
braixen<00:02:37.569> doesn't<00:02:37.930> really<00:02:38.080> want<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.830> works

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
braixen doesn't really want that works

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.490 
braixen doesn't really want that works
better<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.670> no<00:02:39.880> more<00:02:40.090> players<00:02:40.390> yeah<00:02:40.720> it's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
better with no more players yeah it's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.180 
better with no more players yeah it's
pretty<00:02:41.709> complicated<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:43.300> more<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.780> a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
pretty complicated it's more of a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.690 
pretty complicated it's more of a
hardcore<00:02:45.190> gamerz<00:02:45.640> game<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.030> guess<00:02:46.440> there's<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
hardcore gamerz game I guess there's the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.150 
hardcore gamerz game I guess there's the
first<00:02:48.940> time<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:49.420> they<00:02:50.319> have<00:02:50.349> someone<00:02:50.770> play<00:02:50.950> it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
first time if they have someone play it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.220 
first time if they have someone play it
they

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
they

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.170 
they
don't<00:02:52.980> really<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.370> what's<00:02:53.550> going<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.940> but

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
don't really know what's going on but

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.300 
don't really know what's going on but
after<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.599> first<00:02:54.780> round<00:02:55.050> yeah<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.099> judge<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
after the first round yeah you judge it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.040 
after the first round yeah you judge it
you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.819> pick<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.180> pretty<00:02:57.420> quickly<00:02:57.690> and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
you can pick it up pretty quickly and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.540 
you can pick it up pretty quickly and
the<00:02:58.200> nice<00:02:58.380> thing<00:02:58.410> about<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.800> auction<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
the nice thing about the auction is it's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.040 
the nice thing about the auction is it's
an<00:02:59.640> auction<00:02:59.819> game<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.390> auctions<00:03:00.840> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
an auction game but the auctions you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.589 
an auction game but the auctions you
only<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:01.560> around<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.920> once<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:03.360> not<00:03:03.450> like

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
only go around the once so it's not like

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.180 
only go around the once so it's not like
you<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.200> bid<00:03:04.380> keeps<00:03:04.650> going<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.160> up

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you get the bid keeps going up and up

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.530 
you get the bid keeps going up and up
and<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.430> you've<00:03:05.640> got<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.880> decide<00:03:06.090> what<00:03:06.300> you're

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and up you've got to decide what you're

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.110 
and up you've got to decide what you're
willing<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> pay<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.709> then<00:03:07.920> bid<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.940> cuz<00:03:09.090> you

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
willing to pay and then bid that cuz you

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.699 
willing to pay and then bid that cuz you
don't<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> bid<00:03:10.080> by<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.319> next<00:03:10.590> day

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
don't want to be a bid by the next day

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.690 
don't want to be a bid by the next day
because<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.920> don't<00:03:11.100> get<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.250> better<00:03:11.340> shot<00:03:11.670> at

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
because you don't get a better shot at

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.780 
because you don't get a better shot at
it<00:03:11.910> right<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:13.620> once<00:03:13.860> once<00:03:14.340> you've<00:03:14.520> been<00:03:14.670> is

a<00:04:34.560> little<00:04:34.680> bit<00:04:34.800> different<00:04:35.220> thing<00:04:35.400> but<00:04:35.580> it's

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
a little bit different thing but it's

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.840 
a little bit different thing but it's
still<00:04:36.060> very<00:04:36.240> close<00:04:37.280> it's<00:04:38.280> like<00:04:38.340> any<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.820> of

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
still very close it's like any one of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.670 
still very close it's like any one of
them<00:04:39.060> was<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.480> was<00:04:39.630> necessarily<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.530> much

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
them was I was necessarily that much

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.640 
them was I was necessarily that much
better<00:04:40.890> of<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:42.000> strategy<00:04:42.480> there<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.350> there's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
better of a strategy there is there's

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.320 
better of a strategy there is there's
some<00:04:43.920> luck<00:04:44.130> too<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.460> which<00:04:44.610> cards<00:04:44.970> come<00:04:45.210> up

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
some luck too in which cards come up

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.830 
some luck too in which cards come up
when<00:04:48.710> on<00:04:49.710> your<00:04:50.220> turn<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.730> like<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.330> mean<00:04:51.510> you're

when on your turn to like I mean you're

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.420 
when on your turn to like I mean you're
not<00:04:51.960> always<00:04:52.200> gonna<00:04:52.320> get<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> same<00:04:52.830> cards<00:04:53.280> I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
not always gonna get the same cards I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.430 
not always gonna get the same cards I
mean<00:04:53.610> means<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.240> character<00:04:54.810> or<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> character

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
mean means is character or the character

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.690 
mean means is character or the character
cards<00:04:55.710> are<00:04:55.800> going<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:55.950> be<00:04:56.040> doing<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.370> building

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
cards are going to be doing the building

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.800 
cards are going to be doing the building
cards<00:04:56.910> -<00:04:57.150> right<00:04:57.270> they're<00:04:57.420> gonna<00:04:57.510> be<00:04:57.630> different

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
cards - right they're gonna be different

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.390 
cards - right they're gonna be different
-<00:04:58.230> certain<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.620> some<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.890> them<00:04:58.980> never<00:04:59.160> show

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
- certain that some of them never show

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.310 
- certain that some of them never show
up<00:04:59.460> right

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
up right

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.510 
up right
only<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.350> couple<00:05:01.530> yeah<00:05:01.920> but<00:05:02.220> there's<00:05:02.400> always

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
only a couple yeah but there's always

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.920 
only a couple yeah but there's always
nobody<00:05:02.850> at<00:05:02.910> least<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.090> couple<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.510> never<00:05:03.690> show

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
nobody at least a couple that never show

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.720 
nobody at least a couple that never show
up<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.590> order<00:05:04.920> that<00:05:04.950> they<00:05:05.190> show<00:05:05.370> up<00:05:05.490> in<00:05:05.610> DC

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
up and the order that they show up in DC

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.470 
up and the order that they show up in DC
is<00:05:05.940> always<00:05:06.270> different<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.970> part's<00:05:09.270> lucky

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
is always different that part's lucky

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.990 
is always different that part's lucky
but<00:05:09.720> there's<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.200> much<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.620> choose<00:05:10.650> yo<00:05:11.490> yeah<00:05:11.760> so

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
but there's so much to choose yo yeah so

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.520 
but there's so much to choose yo yeah so
I<00:05:12.030> mean<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.240> guess<00:05:12.330> it's<00:05:12.690> not<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:13.080> doesn't<00:05:13.410> feel

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
I mean I guess it's not it doesn't feel

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.690 
I mean I guess it's not it doesn't feel
like<00:05:13.590> it's<00:05:13.890> completely<00:05:14.550> luck<00:05:15.540> based<00:05:16.050> because

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
like it's completely luck based because

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.760 
like it's completely luck based because
even<00:05:17.700> if<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.000> card<00:05:18.390> that<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.170> want

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
even if the card that you want

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.140 
even if the card that you want
don't<00:05:20.010> come<00:05:20.190> up<00:05:20.220> there's<00:05:20.580> still<00:05:20.760> an<00:05:20.850> option

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
don't come up there's still an option

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.450 
don't come up there's still an option
that<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.810> try<00:05:22.380> something<00:05:22.620> different<00:05:22.830> if

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
that you can try something different if

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.070 
that you can try something different if
you<00:05:23.520> try<00:05:23.790> different<00:05:23.850> strategy<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:24.930> don't

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
you try different strategy and you don't

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.860 
you try different strategy and you don't
feel<00:05:25.260> like<00:05:25.290> you're<00:05:25.530> stuck

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.970 

you<00:05:27.960> know<00:05:28.050> you're<00:05:28.260> not<00:05:28.410> getting<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.740> cars

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
you know you're not getting the cars

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.580 
you know you're not getting the cars
that<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.310> want<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.850> on<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:31.020> turn<00:05:31.290> order

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
that you want and on the turn order

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.500 
that you want and on the turn order
really<00:05:32.010> affects<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.610> order<00:05:33.060> in<00:05:33.240> which<00:05:33.390> the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
really affects the order in which the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.170 
really affects the order in which the
carbs<00:05:33.870> come<00:05:34.350> up<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.710> like<00:05:35.580> if<00:05:35.700> you're<00:05:35.850> first

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
carbs come up and like if you're first

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.090 
carbs come up and like if you're first
you<00:05:36.480> get<00:05:36.600> first<00:05:36.870> choice<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.470> that's<00:05:37.650> really

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
you get first choice and that's really

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.560 
you get first choice and that's really
quite<00:05:38.250> important<00:05:38.760> like<00:05:38.850> you<00:05:39.030> were<00:05:39.180> sitting

were<00:05:45.180> always<00:05:45.300> getting<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.630> last<00:05:45.900> choice<00:05:46.320> of

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
were always getting the last choice of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.260 
were always getting the last choice of
things<00:05:46.770> was<00:05:46.920> kind<00:05:47.160> of<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.520> was<00:05:47.550> harder<00:05:47.970> for<00:05:48.000> you

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
things was kind of it was harder for you

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.500 
things was kind of it was harder for you
but<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.320> was<00:05:49.500> kind<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.830> what<00:05:50.070> I<00:05:50.100> was

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
but that was kind of what I was

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.720 
but that was kind of what I was
experimenting<00:05:51.510> with<00:05:51.900> to<00:05:52.860> see<00:05:53.100> how<00:05:53.250> much<00:05:53.460> that

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
experimenting with to see how much that

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.460 
experimenting with to see how much that
would<00:05:53.850> affect<00:05:54.180> me<00:05:54.420> right<00:05:54.780> didn't<00:05:55.230> have<00:05:55.350> that

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
would affect me right didn't have that

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.750 
would affect me right didn't have that
big<00:05:55.680> of<00:05:55.710> an<00:05:55.830> effect<00:05:55.950> because<00:05:56.370> there's<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:56.670> much

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
big of an effect because there's so much

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.180 
big of an effect because there's so much
to<00:05:56.970> choose<00:05:57.150> from<00:05:57.210> yeah<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.320> especially<00:05:58.560> with

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
to choose from yeah and especially with

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.920 
to choose from yeah and especially with
everyone<00:05:59.550> doing<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.850> different<00:06:00.180> strategy<00:06:00.420> that

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
everyone doing a different strategy that

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.480 
everyone doing a different strategy that
people<00:06:01.410> are<00:06:01.680> different<00:06:01.830> people<00:06:02.160> are<00:06:02.370> going

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
people are different people are going

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.820 
people are different people are going
for<00:06:02.610> different<00:06:02.910> things<00:06:03.300> like<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:03.960> always<00:06:04.620> got

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
for different things like I always got

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.690 
for different things like I always got
the<00:06:05.390> soldier<00:06:06.390> and<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:07.160> vestal<00:06:08.160> virgin<00:06:08.520> or

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
the soldier and the vestal virgin or

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.269 
the soldier and the vestal virgin or
whatever<00:06:08.940> right<00:06:09.540> so<00:06:10.410> that<00:06:10.560> I<00:06:10.590> was

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
whatever right so that I was

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.689 
whatever right so that I was
or<00:06:11.399> cubes<00:06:11.699> and<00:06:11.939> go<00:06:12.059> on<00:06:12.209> to<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.509> yeah<00:06:12.659> it's<00:06:12.869> yeah

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
or cubes and go on to the yeah it's yeah

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.009 
or cubes and go on to the yeah it's yeah
but<00:06:14.699> how<00:06:14.849> long<00:06:15.089> did<00:06:15.269> it<00:06:15.329> take<00:06:15.389> us<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.809> play

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:16.019 
but how long did it take us to play

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:17.329 
but how long did it take us to play
there's<00:06:16.829> what<00:06:16.979> an<00:06:17.069> hour

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:17.339 
there's what an hour

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.419 
there's what an hour
I<00:06:17.849> don't<00:06:18.089> know<00:06:18.149> and<00:06:18.329> a<00:06:18.359> half<00:06:18.509> was<00:06:18.869> it<00:06:19.019> that<00:06:19.139> long

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:19.429 
I don't know and a half was it that long

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:23.509 
I don't know and a half was it that long
yeah<00:06:20.429> a<00:06:20.629> sixty<00:06:21.629> yeah<00:06:22.019> 60<00:06:22.439> to<00:06:22.559> 90<00:06:22.799> I<00:06:22.949> think<00:06:23.219> yeah

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:23.519 
yeah a sixty yeah 60 to 90 I think yeah

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.609 
yeah a sixty yeah 60 to 90 I think yeah
a<00:06:23.759> lot<00:06:24.149> of<00:06:24.179> that<00:06:24.389> setting<00:06:24.899> up<00:06:24.989> but<00:06:25.379> she<00:06:25.499> could

00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:25.619 
a lot of that setting up but she could

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.129 
a lot of that setting up but she could
easily<00:06:25.739> get<00:06:26.039> it<00:06:26.189> down<00:06:26.309> to<00:06:26.339> an<00:06:26.579> hour<00:06:26.699> I<00:06:26.849> think

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
easily get it down to an hour I think

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.959 
easily get it down to an hour I think
like<00:06:28.139> we've<00:06:28.259> only<00:06:28.409> played<00:06:28.619> it<00:06:28.829> by<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:29.009> twice

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
like we've only played it by the twice

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.269 
like we've only played it by the twice
later<00:06:30.329> with<00:06:30.479> expansion<00:06:31.109> teams<00:06:31.349> right<00:06:31.889> which

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:32.279 
later with expansion teams right which

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.559 
later with expansion teams right which
is<00:06:32.429> nice<00:06:32.609> I<00:06:32.849> let<00:06:33.029> I<00:06:33.059> really<00:06:33.329> like<00:06:33.479> the

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
is nice I let I really like the

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.969 
is nice I let I really like the
expansion<00:06:34.219> one<00:06:35.219> person<00:06:35.639> had<00:06:36.149> to<00:06:36.299> learn<00:06:36.449> it

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
expansion one person had to learn it

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.489 
expansion one person had to learn it
expansion<00:06:38.899> basically<00:06:39.899> just<00:06:40.139> gives<00:06:40.349> you<00:06:40.469> a

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:40.499 
expansion basically just gives you a

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.429 
expansion basically just gives you a
couple<00:06:40.829> extra<00:06:40.919> character<00:06:41.549> cards<00:06:41.909> in<00:06:42.089> them

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
couple extra character cards in them

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:46.249 
couple extra character cards in them
extra<00:06:43.439> vents<00:06:43.889> and<00:06:44.039> an<00:06:44.189> extra<00:06:45.019> public<00:06:46.019> work

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
extra vents and an extra public work

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.569 
extra vents and an extra public work
card<00:06:48.139> but<00:06:49.139> I<00:06:49.169> think<00:06:49.649> it<00:06:49.739> makes<00:06:49.889> it<00:06:50.009> better

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:50.579 
card but I think it makes it better

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:52.249 
card but I think it makes it better
well<00:06:50.999> yes<00:06:51.239> funny<00:06:51.569> I<00:06:51.659> don't<00:06:51.779> think<00:06:51.989> anybody

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
well yes funny I don't think anybody

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.159 
well yes funny I don't think anybody
even<00:06:52.289> tried<00:06:52.739> using<00:06:53.039> the<00:06:53.249> cloud<00:06:53.459> heaters<00:06:54.169> in

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
even tried using the cloud heaters in

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.679 
even tried using the cloud heaters in
the<00:06:55.229> game<00:06:55.559> but<00:06:56.069> that<00:06:56.549> would<00:06:56.909> have<00:06:56.939> made<00:06:57.179> a<00:06:57.209> bit

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
the game but that would have made a bit

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.299 
the game but that would have made a bit
of<00:06:57.719> a<00:06:57.899> difference<00:06:58.289> because<00:06:58.379> if<00:06:58.709> somebody<00:06:59.039> sat

00:06:59.299 --> 00:06:59.309 
of a difference because if somebody sat

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:02.749 
of a difference because if somebody sat
tight<00:06:59.579> yeah<00:07:00.059> yeah<00:07:00.829> it's<00:07:01.829> such<00:07:01.979> a<00:07:02.009> philosophers

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
tight yeah yeah it's such a philosophers

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.009 
tight yeah yeah it's such a philosophers
which<00:07:02.999> is<00:07:03.179> in<00:07:03.299> the<00:07:03.389> expansion<00:07:03.809> that<00:07:03.929> was

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:04.019 
which is in the expansion that was

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:05.539 
which is in the expansion that was
definitely<00:07:04.499> used<00:07:04.679> by<00:07:04.829> a<00:07:04.860> lot<00:07:05.129> of<00:07:05.159> different

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:05.549 
definitely used by a lot of different

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:08.269 
definitely used by a lot of different
people<00:07:05.669> it<00:07:06.569> is<00:07:06.689> about<00:07:06.869> six<00:07:07.319> different<00:07:07.649> seven

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:08.279 
people it is about six different seven

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.049 
people it is about six different seven
different<00:07:08.429> phases<00:07:08.929> each<00:07:09.929> one<00:07:10.229> is<00:07:10.409> takes<00:07:11.399> very

00:07:12.049 --> 00:07:12.059 
different phases each one is takes very

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:15.139 
different phases each one is takes very
little<00:07:12.209> time<00:07:12.449> but<00:07:12.809> seven<00:07:13.619> phase<00:07:13.859> against<00:07:14.519> five

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:15.149 
little time but seven phase against five

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:17.989 
little time but seven phase against five
five<00:07:15.509> rounds<00:07:16.069> and<00:07:17.069> they<00:07:17.189> all<00:07:17.369> take<00:07:17.610> like

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:17.999 
five rounds and they all take like

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:22.819 
five rounds and they all take like
they're<00:07:18.149> all<00:07:18.569> done<00:07:18.779> very<00:07:19.079> quickly<00:07:21.709> it'd<00:07:22.709> be

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:22.829 
they're all done very quickly it'd be

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:24.350 
they're all done very quickly it'd be
hard<00:07:23.069> to<00:07:23.129> suffer<00:07:23.399> from<00:07:23.579> analysis<00:07:23.879> paralysis

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
hard to suffer from analysis paralysis

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.089 
hard to suffer from analysis paralysis
and<00:07:24.779> that's<00:07:24.929> too<00:07:25.169> because<00:07:25.649> there's<00:07:25.919> not<00:07:26.039> a

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 
and that's too because there's not a

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.539 
and that's too because there's not a
whole<00:07:26.339> lot<00:07:26.369> of<00:07:27.349> you<00:07:28.349> can't<00:07:28.589> recognize<00:07:28.979> over

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:29.549 
whole lot of you can't recognize over

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:30.979 
whole lot of you can't recognize over
your<00:07:29.669> choices<00:07:29.969> like<00:07:30.419> you<00:07:30.539> either<00:07:30.689> do

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:30.989 
your choices like you either do

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:32.689 
your choices like you either do
something<00:07:31.199> you<00:07:31.349> don't<00:07:31.739> think<00:07:31.769> it<00:07:32.039> Rock<00:07:32.249> harder

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 
something you don't think it Rock harder

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.999 
something you don't think it Rock harder
you<00:07:32.819> don't<00:07:33.479> it's<00:07:33.959> pretty<00:07:34.229> tight<00:07:34.529> yeah<00:07:34.739> yeah

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.009 
you don't it's pretty tight yeah yeah

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:36.709
