00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.909
 and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.599
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.210
 a new circuit and we are in circuit 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.710
 Maria, so let's go to guys and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.670
 let's see a little more thoroughly this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.850
 circuit 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.800
 very well we are in 150 already as I said 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.840
 in some previous video I will do 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.630
 all circuits in 150 for being the 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.040
 highest difficulty the game has and 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.890
 let's go there guys let's see if 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.420
 we get is first place and good 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.250
 come out all over here, go see if we 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.250
 we do with some money there are the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 we do with 2 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 and we have the spokesperson is not there was 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.579
 again to meditate 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 so I get with the first 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.929
 let's go there is the fact that we have the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.260
 wheels with antigravity that's why we've 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.629
 stuck there a little boost very well 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.089
 coins and making it nice with mortals 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.199
 back in the jumps 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.500
 the truth that usually happens to the game 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.220
 guys, I'm very, very happy with the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.080
 purchase of mario kart 8 madre mÃ­a 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.240
 the hours and hours that he will give me 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.550
 fun and that we of course 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.340
 because once all the circuits go up 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.050
 I have something very very cool prepared 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.370
 Well surely I have already said 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.040
 on the channel when this video is 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.560
 uploaded 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 but good apart from the direct mother 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.630
 mine what are we going to have fun with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.000
 Mario Kart 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.360
 let's see if he does not give me the piranha and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 we will be dodged to very centimeters 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.799
 well now deadly for big there is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.829
 and now it's pretty cool very well 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.360
 we fit in the excellent curve uy 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:53.360
 veronese we have dodged it for nothing very 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.040
 well maybe the piranha 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.900
 to see if they throw me blue guys now that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.330
 I can destroy it, it would be good to destroy 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.100
 heart because always second state 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.920
 with all those who send bundled mario 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.020
 kart 7 here with this dear object 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.780
 let's say I can untie your mom was 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.800
 against her and against all the blues 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.540
 come this mother of mine sometimes when 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.540
 I wish that blue makes me the truth 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 and this mortal mortal back by 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.650
 in front and we adjust in the curve we have 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.760
 the 10 coins so if they do not give us with 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.880
 nothing the truth that we can take out 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.260
 easily half track in fact already 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.870
 I see them 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.280
 they are quite far away but 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.840
 good as I say these series to see a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.980
 little bit more circuits 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.550
 there are the gums 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.519
 I came and came and just entered 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.090
 goal if I had not destroyed it if you've 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 saved 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.480
 efe
