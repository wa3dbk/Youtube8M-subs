like that when you export it is going to

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.070 
like that when you export it is going to
save<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:09.890> try<00:05:10.160> saving<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:10.610> again<00:05:10.850> go<00:05:11.630> down<00:05:11.840> to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
save and try saving it again go down to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.730 
save and try saving it again go down to
the<00:05:12.110> file<00:05:13.030> type<00:05:14.030> i<00:05:14.300> think<00:05:14.600> is<00:05:14.990> what<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:15.410> it's

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
the file type i think is what it is it's

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.400 
the file type i think is what it is it's
the<00:05:15.830> second<00:05:16.220> part<00:05:17.080> because<00:05:18.080> there's<00:05:18.290> always

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
the second part because there's always

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.500 
the second part because there's always
two<00:05:18.620> bars<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.130> it's<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.340> second<00:05:19.700> one<00:05:19.790> save<00:05:20.479> it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
two bars and it's the second one save it

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.960 
two bars and it's the second one save it
as<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.720> JPEG<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.620> that's<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.460> file<00:05:22.669> that<00:05:22.700> you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
as a JPEG and that's the file that you

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.280 
as a JPEG and that's the file that you
want<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.270> save<00:05:23.390> it<00:05:23.540> as<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.870> then<00:05:23.960> whatever

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
want to save it as and then whatever

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.380 
want to save it as and then whatever
name<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:26.290> then<00:05:27.290> that<00:05:27.620> lets<00:05:28.400> it<00:05:28.550> uploaded<00:05:28.970> EVR

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
name and then that lets it uploaded EVR

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.570 
name and then that lets it uploaded EVR
otherwise<00:05:30.020> it's<00:05:30.350> going<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.710> be<00:05:30.890> an<00:05:31.190> art<00:05:31.820> rage

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580
