many drones on and twelve minutes into
the<00:02:22.750> game<00:02:22.959> he<00:02:23.890> had<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.370> gotten<00:02:24.459> drops<00:02:24.849> so

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
the game he had to have gotten drops so

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.809 
the game he had to have gotten drops so
Shimon<00:02:25.660> did<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.959> drop<00:02:26.290> off<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:27.069> Seth<00:02:27.610> Lord

to<00:02:28.000> do<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> little<00:02:28.360> bit<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.569> damage<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.950> it

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
to do a little bit of damage but it

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.850 
to do a little bit of damage but it
because<00:02:31.090> support<00:02:31.750> isn't<00:02:31.989> massing<00:02:32.410> at<00:02:32.560> all<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
because support isn't massing at all I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.190 
because support isn't massing at all I
mean<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.519> 12<00:02:34.030> minutes<00:02:34.209> into<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.599> game<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
mean this is out of control he's not got

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.500 
mean this is out of control he's not got
any<00:02:42.790> mass<00:02:43.090> all<00:02:43.510> he<00:02:43.630> has<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:45.030> 15<00:02:46.030> something
