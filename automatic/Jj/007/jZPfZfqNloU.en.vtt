just thought I'd mention it because

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
just thought I'd mention it because
maybe<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.219> actually<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.730> key<00:00:48.149> factor<00:00:48.360> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
maybe there's actually a key factor in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.000

the game let me know your thoughts on it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.500 
the game let me know your thoughts on it
maybe<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.610> sequence<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
maybe it's a sequence you have to do to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.150 
maybe it's a sequence you have to do to
unlock<00:00:51.629> something<00:00:51.960> something<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.039> but

unlock something something like that but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.260 
unlock something something like that but
anyway<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.460> thought<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:53.850> briefly

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
anyway I just thought I would briefly
mention<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.809> better<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> keep<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.070> then

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
mention that better to keep it in then

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.740 
mention that better to keep it in then
leave<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.760> anyway<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> next<00:00:57.210> image

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
leave it out but anyway the next image

can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.820> couple<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> zombies<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.810> at

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
can see a couple of zombies here at

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
can see a couple of zombies here at
their<00:01:22.080> normal<00:01:22.259> skins<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> exosuits<00:01:23.369> on

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
their normal skins with the exosuits on

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
their normal skins with the exosuits on
them<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.810> Burger

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
them but then we can actually see Burger

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
them but then we can actually see Burger

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
another kind of cool factor to it we can

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
another kind of cool factor to it we can
also<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:33.900> hand<00:01:34.049> side<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.500> zombie

also see on the right hand side a zombie

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.440 
also see on the right hand side a zombie
with<00:01:35.189> spice<00:01:35.460> coming<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
with spice coming out of it which is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.580 
with spice coming out of it which is
actually<00:01:36.570> what<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.810> talked<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.439> today's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually what I talked about in today's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.710 
actually what I talked about in today's
video<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:38.939> first<00:01:39.210> day<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.360> went<00:01:39.630> up

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
video at the very first day that went up

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.880 
video at the very first day that went up
today<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.020> let<00:01:40.380> me<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.710> tossing

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that or maybe I can shoot sparks a chat

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.240 
that or maybe I can shoot sparks a chat
or<00:01:42.810> maybe<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.439> said<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.770> may<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.100> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
or maybe as I said it may be just be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.649 
or maybe as I said it may be just be
another<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.700> skin<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> give<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> kind

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
another kind of skin to give that a kind

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
another kind of skin to give that a kind
of<00:01:45.720> cool<00:01:45.899> factor<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.680> anyway<00:01:47.040> killed<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> note

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
of cool factor but anyway killed to note

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
of cool factor but anyway killed to note
ok<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> next<00:01:48.360> image<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
ok the next image is actually from is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069 
ok the next image is actually from is
actually<00:01:50.460> Jon<00:01:50.670> Bernthal<00:01:51.119> holding<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
actually Jon Bernthal holding the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
actually Jon Bernthal holding the
magnetron<00:01:52.799> microwave<00:01:53.369> gun<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.329> i<00:01:54.360> actually

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
magnetron microwave gun as so i actually

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.179 
magnetron microwave gun as so i actually
did<00:01:54.930> talk<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.590> today's<00:01:55.890> video<00:01:56.040> as

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
did talk about this in today's video as

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.230 
did talk about this in today's video as
well<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.549> covered<00:01:56.880> quite<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> bit

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
well actually covered quite a bit

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.330 
well actually covered quite a bit
today's<00:01:57.540> video<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.200> first<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.619> am<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.159> yeah

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
today's video the first one am but yeah

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
today's video the first one am but yeah
I<00:01:59.369> guess<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> magnetron

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
I guess right it is the magnetron

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
I guess right it is the magnetron
microwave<00:02:01.020> gun<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.890> looks<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.369> badass

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
microwave gun and it looks really badass

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
microwave gun and it looks really badass
here<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.240> an<00:02:03.360> image<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.560> first

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
here is an image from the kind of first

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
here is an image from the kind of first
person<00:02:05.219> point<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.549> view<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.810> down

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
person point of view as you can see down

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
person point of view as you can see down
the<00:02:07.110> bottom<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.530> mwg<00:02:08.520> obviously<00:02:08.910> standing

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the bottom right mwg obviously standing

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.390 
the bottom right mwg obviously standing
for<00:02:09.330> magnetron<00:02:09.899> microwave<00:02:10.619> gun<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
for magnetron microwave gun and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.770 
for magnetron microwave gun and
then<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.579> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.909> as<00:02:12.269> kind<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.510> percentage

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
then you can see as kind of percentage

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.530 
then you can see as kind of percentage
like<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.349> EMP<00:02:14.069> m1<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.879> kind<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.060> an<00:02:15.150> energy

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
like the EMP m1 it's kind of an energy

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.300 
like the EMP m1 it's kind of an energy
energy<00:02:15.870> weapon<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.590> guess<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:16.829> could<00:02:16.920> say<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.129> I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
energy weapon I guess you could say so I

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.429 
energy weapon I guess you could say so I
like<00:02:18.269> has<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> percentage<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> more<00:02:19.409> you

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
like has a percentage and the more you

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.080 
like has a percentage and the more you
use<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.739> Sun<00:02:19.980> Goes<00:02:20.220> Down<00:02:20.250> has<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> charge<00:02:20.939> back

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
use the Sun Goes Down has a charge back

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
use the Sun Goes Down has a charge back
up<00:02:21.239> kind<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.510> thing<00:02:21.659> have<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.170> definite<00:02:22.470> cool

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
up kind of thing have a definite cool

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
up kind of thing have a definite cool
stone<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.040> looks<00:02:23.220> absolutely<00:02:23.430> awesome<00:02:23.640> so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
stone that looks absolutely awesome so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.729 
stone that looks absolutely awesome so
this<00:02:24.480> next<00:02:24.750> image<00:02:25.019> here<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.319> actually<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
this next image here is actually the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.470 
this next image here is actually the
effect<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.549> magnetron<00:02:26.970> mark<00:02:27.000> we've<00:02:27.269> gone

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
effect of the magnetron mark we've gone

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.240 
effect of the magnetron mark we've gone
so<00:02:27.930> once<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.290> shoot<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.560> zombie<00:02:28.890> kinda<00:02:29.159> like

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so once you shoot the zombie kinda like

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.979 
so once you shoot the zombie kinda like
what<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.519> in<00:02:29.609> moon<00:02:29.849> can't<00:02:30.420> exactly<00:02:30.659> even

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
what was in moon can't exactly even

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.869 
what was in moon can't exactly even
remember<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.859> name<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.189> the<00:02:32.340> gun<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:32.730> moon

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
remember the name of the gun and moon

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.490 
remember the name of the gun and moon
but<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.299> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.810> makes<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.019> zombies<00:02:34.379> gonna

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
but I kind of makes the zombies gonna

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.250 
but I kind of makes the zombies gonna
blow<00:02:34.739> up<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.299> get<00:02:36.299> these<00:02:36.420> kind<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.720> boils

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
blow up kind of get these kind of boils

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.630 
blow up kind of get these kind of boils
on<00:02:37.379> them<00:02:37.530> or<00:02:37.620> whatever<00:02:37.769> from<00:02:37.980> burning<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.489> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
on them or whatever from burning and it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.000 
on them or whatever from burning and it
looks<00:02:38.879> absolutely<00:02:39.090> amazing<00:02:39.620> ok<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
looks absolutely amazing ok so then the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
was looking at this trailer kind of

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
was looking at this trailer kind of
breaking<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.079> down<00:02:46.109> frame<00:02:46.769> by<00:02:46.799> frame<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.400> we

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
breaking it down frame by frame and we

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.250 
breaking it down frame by frame and we
see<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.700> flipping<00:02:48.239> crocodile<00:02:49.019> alligator

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260

see this flipping crocodile alligator
massive<00:02:50.099> beast<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.700> had<00:02:51.120> jumping<00:02:51.629> out<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
massive beast I had jumping out of the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.020 
massive beast I had jumping out of the
water<00:02:52.200> assumingly<00:02:52.920> down<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.519> sewers<00:02:53.909> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
water assumingly down in the sewers and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.910 
water assumingly down in the sewers and
just<00:02:54.510> devouring<00:02:55.049> these<00:02:55.260> zombies<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.739> maybe

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
just devouring these zombies so maybe

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.589 
just devouring these zombies so maybe
it's<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.159> trap<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.700> activate<00:02:57.030> or<00:02:57.359> maybe

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
it's a trap you can activate or maybe

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.119 
it's a trap you can activate or maybe
this<00:02:57.810> thing<00:02:57.989> could<00:02:58.139> even<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.409> for<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.709> I'm<00:02:58.950> not

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129

absolutely<00:03:00.930> insane<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.829> definite<00:03:02.459> leave<00:03:02.579> a

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639

watching the trailer because it's

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.860 
watching the trailer because it's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
definitely something easy to miss but

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.629 
definitely something easy to miss but
once<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:07.500> go<00:03:07.590> frame<00:03:07.799> by<00:03:07.829> frame<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.430> see

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
once you go frame by frame you can see

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.920 
once you go frame by frame you can see
this<00:03:08.790> absolute<00:03:09.150> beast<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.750> thing

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
this absolute beast of the thing

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.190 
this absolute beast of the thing
devouring<00:03:10.859> these<00:03:11.159> zombies<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.810> then<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.019> next

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
devouring these zombies so then the next

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.289 
devouring these zombies so then the next
image<00:03:13.500> here<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.129> someone<00:03:14.849> being<00:03:14.970> airlifted

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
image here is of someone being airlifted

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.530 
image here is of someone being airlifted
out<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> burger<00:03:16.919> town<00:03:17.129> map<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:17.940> this

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
out of the burger town map now this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.180 
out of the burger town map now this
actually<00:03:18.930> may<00:03:19.109> be<00:03:19.139> kind<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.829> ending

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
actually may be kind of like the ending

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.770 
actually may be kind of like the ending
you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.639> know<00:03:20.879> you<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.209> do<00:03:21.389> sort<00:03:21.750> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
you can do I know you can do sort of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.720 
you can do I know you can do sort of
endings<00:03:22.139> I<00:03:22.260> think<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.340> extras

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
endings I think in that in the extras

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.189 
endings I think in that in the extras
ami<00:03:23.849> map<00:03:24.060> software<00:03:24.239> or<00:03:24.599> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:24.870> use<00:03:25.079> to

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
ami map software or you can just use to

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.439 
ami map software or you can just use to
continue<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> waves<00:03:25.919> but<00:03:26.849> I<00:03:26.879> think<00:03:27.359> this

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
continue with the waves but I think this

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.819 
continue with the waves but I think this
may<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.720> an<00:03:27.900> ending<00:03:28.139> or<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.379> actually<00:03:28.650> may<00:03:28.799> be

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
may be an ending or it actually may be

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.319 
may be an ending or it actually may be
the<00:03:29.129> new<00:03:29.280> kind<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.519> Survivor<00:03:29.879> mode<00:03:30.030> they<00:03:30.269> were

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
the new kind of Survivor mode they were

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.449 
the new kind of Survivor mode they were
talking<00:03:30.659> about<00:03:30.780> or<00:03:31.650> where<00:03:32.010> maybe<00:03:32.159> you<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
talking about or where maybe you have to

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.009 
talking about or where maybe you have to
go<00:03:32.549> liberate<00:03:32.790> kind<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.329> some<00:03:33.629> Burger<00:03:33.900> town

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
go liberate kind of some Burger town

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.930 
go liberate kind of some Burger town
employees<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.560> are<00:03:34.620> stuck<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.220> then<00:03:35.819> they

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
employees that are stuck and then they

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.189 
employees that are stuck and then they
get<00:03:36.030> airlifted<00:03:36.269> out<00:03:36.599> something<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.169> I

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
get airlifted out something like that I

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.449 
get airlifted out something like that I
think<00:03:37.290> that'd<00:03:37.620> probably<00:03:37.829> be<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> better<00:03:38.159> guess

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
think that'd probably be a better guess

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
think that'd probably be a better guess
and<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.269> kind<00:03:39.419> of<00:03:39.449> Survivor<00:03:39.750> mode<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.169> maybe

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and the kind of Survivor mode so maybe

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.930 
and the kind of Survivor mode so maybe
that's<00:03:40.739> our<00:03:40.829> first<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.280> sneak<00:03:41.519> peek<00:03:41.760> at

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
that's our first kind of sneak peek at

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.309 
that's our first kind of sneak peek at
the<00:03:42.030> Survivor<00:03:42.359> mode<00:03:42.510> looks<00:03:42.780> pretty<00:03:42.959> cool<00:03:43.109> all

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
the Survivor mode looks pretty cool all

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.289 
the Survivor mode looks pretty cool all
the<00:03:43.349> same<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.889> then<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.549> have<00:03:44.669> our<00:03:44.849> another

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
the same and then we have our another

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.030 
the same and then we have our another
image<00:03:45.629> and<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.959> actually<00:03:46.079> shows<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.409> Goliath

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
image and it actually shows the Goliath

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.189 
image and it actually shows the Goliath
Dombey<00:03:47.579> as<00:03:47.729> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.299> see<00:03:48.449> this<00:03:48.599> guy<00:03:48.750> has<00:03:48.989> the

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
Dombey as you can see this guy has the

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.479 
Dombey as you can see this guy has the
sign<00:03:49.409> what<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> originally<00:03:49.919> thought<00:03:50.159> it<00:03:50.370> was

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
sign what I originally thought it was

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.890 
sign what I originally thought it was
like<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:50.699> rocket<00:03:51.090> launcher<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.419> some<00:03:51.569> reason

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
like a rocket launcher for some reason

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.659 
like a rocket launcher for some reason
but<00:03:52.620> anyway<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.919> can<00:03:53.069> see<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.340> clearly<00:03:53.549> a

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
but anyway you can see it's clearly a

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.869 
but anyway you can see it's clearly a
sign<00:03:54.299> in<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.629> video<00:03:55.409> I<00:03:55.739> seen<00:03:56.040> today<00:03:56.250> he

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
sign in the video I seen today he

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.879 
sign in the video I seen today he
actually<00:03:57.030> had<00:03:57.389> am<00:03:57.629> I'm<00:03:58.290> not<00:03:58.500> even<00:03:58.560> sure<00:03:58.709> what

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
actually had am I'm not even sure what

00:03:58.889 --> 00:03:59.899 
actually had am I'm not even sure what
it<00:03:58.949> was<00:03:59.040> he<00:03:59.159> had<00:03:59.250> some<00:03:59.400> other<00:03:59.489> sort<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> weapon

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
it was he had some other sort of weapon
