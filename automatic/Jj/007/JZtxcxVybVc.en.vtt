00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:14.029
Hi to all Opel fans and follower. Today I am at the Nürburgring at the Opel testcenter.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.580
I am going to have a very exciting appointment, because today I am going to test

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.460
my Nürburgring knowledge.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.839
I am going to do some test drives with all the new Opel models.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.699
I will be accompanied by one of the best trainers you can have here at the Nürburgring:

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.880
By Volker Strycek

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.340
I won't tell too much or anything new, when I say, that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.030
the Opel DNA is full of motorsport.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.610
We already made many successes,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.690
starting with the DTM up to the Rallye Championship.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.670
We can count several motorsport victories.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.490
About two years ago, we bethought to our sportive roots again.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.700
We entered the world of motorsport again and we especially focus on young talents in

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.000
two Adam Opel Rallye Cups.
In Germany and in France.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.640
Also we have a own Cup with the Astra OPC

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.710
within the VLN Rallye.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.450
During my last visit at the Baltic Sea I once more saw

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.610
how good the Rallye ADAMs are able to perform.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.450
The aim is to use all the experience and knowledge, that we get within the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.280
world of motorsport on our products.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.740
Corsa, Insignia and Astra OPC

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.560
are the best examples for that.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.420
I know that quite a lot people wish to see more Opel sport models.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.730
With the ADAM S we try to fulfill these wishes.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.590
The 1,4 liter turbo engine with 150 HP including the athletic chassis

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.290
make the ADAM even more sportive.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.400
By the way, fi you ever wanna drive an OPC by your own

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.230
I can recommend to do a training course.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.600
In this sense...

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.180
I am off to spin a few rounds.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.280
Your Karl-Thomas Neumann
