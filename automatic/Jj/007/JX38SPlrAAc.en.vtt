SSD<00:02:11.850> it's<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> say<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> will<00:02:13.320> need

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
SSD it's going to say that it will need

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.870 
SSD it's going to say that it will need
to<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.530> restarted<00:02:13.890> let's<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.490> ahead<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.790> do

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
to be restarted let's go ahead and do

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.140 
to be restarted let's go ahead and do
that

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:42.990 

systems<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.299> restarting

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.320 

then<00:02:43.780> begins<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.200> copy<00:02:44.880> partitions<00:02:45.880> first<00:02:46.180> of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
then begins to copy partitions first of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.430 
then begins to copy partitions first of
all<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.660> then<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:48.430> data<00:02:48.670> across<00:02:49.440> clever

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
all and then the data across clever

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.610 
all and then the data across clever
stuff<00:02:50.740> so<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.790> going<00:02:51.910> from<00:02:52.000> SSD<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.840> SSD<00:02:53.320> SSD

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
stuff so it's going from SSD to SSD SSD

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.920 
stuff so it's going from SSD to SSD SSD
through<00:02:54.250> USB<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:55.000> could<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.570> pulled<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.810> in

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
through USB I could have pulled this in

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.600 
through USB I could have pulled this in
internally<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.620> kind<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.890> thought<00:02:57.460> would

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
internally that kind of thought would

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.000 
internally that kind of thought would
have<00:02:57.700> made<00:02:57.820> sense<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.990> do<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.290> when<00:02:59.770> I<00:02:59.800> run

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
have made sense to to do that when I run

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.320 
have made sense to to do that when I run
the<00:03:00.100> benchmarks<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.730> them<00:03:00.820> later<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the benchmarks on them later on in the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.730 
the benchmarks on them later on in the
second<00:03:01.660> video<00:03:01.720> I'm<00:03:02.200> gonna<00:03:02.590> obviously

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
second video I'm gonna obviously

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.860 
second video I'm gonna obviously
internally<00:03:03.700> connect<00:03:03.970> them<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.540> rather

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
internally connect them in so rather

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.770 
internally connect them in so rather
than<00:03:04.990> USB<00:03:05.260> boot<00:03:05.560> them<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:07.360> should<00:03:07.420> find

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
than USB boot them and we should find

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.830 
than USB boot them and we should find
some<00:03:08.650> interesting<00:03:08.980> results<00:03:09.570> come<00:03:10.570> back<00:03:10.600> when

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
some interesting results come back when

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.710 
some interesting results come back when
it's<00:03:10.990> finished<00:03:11.940> okay<00:03:12.940> we're<00:03:13.180> almost<00:03:13.360> halfway

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
it's finished okay we're almost halfway

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.330 
it's finished okay we're almost halfway
now<00:03:15.360> okay<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.720> after<00:03:16.989> finished<00:03:17.590> cloning<00:03:18.220> as

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
now okay so after finished cloning as

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.400 
now okay so after finished cloning as
you<00:03:18.430> see<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.670> shut<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> Machine<00:03:19.030> down<00:03:19.410> it's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
you see it shut the Machine down it's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.170 
you see it shut the Machine down it's
powered<00:03:20.800> down<00:03:23.700> I'm<00:03:24.700> gonna<00:03:24.850> go<00:03:24.970> ahead<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
powered down I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.479 
powered down I'm gonna go ahead and
internally<00:03:25.870> connect<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.290> now<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.830> disconnect

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
internally connect this now I disconnect

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.250 
internally connect this now I disconnect
my<00:03:27.580> SSD<00:03:27.880> drive<00:03:28.330> that's<00:03:28.570> currently<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:28.989> there

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
my SSD drive that's currently in there

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.040 
my SSD drive that's currently in there
so<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.040> go<00:03:30.430> ahead<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:31.709> disconnect<00:03:33.720> my<00:03:34.720> primary

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
so I go ahead and disconnect my primary

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.600 
so I go ahead and disconnect my primary
SSD<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.040> secondary<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:38.470> do<00:03:38.620> tests<00:03:39.310> and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
SSD and the secondary to do tests and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.280 
SSD and the secondary to do tests and
obviously<00:03:39.940> benchmark<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> speed<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.170> we'll

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
obviously benchmark the speed and we'll

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.220 
obviously benchmark the speed and we'll
go<00:03:41.380> back<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.090> full<00:03:43.090> SSD<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.750> test<00:03:43.959> speed

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
go back to this full SSD to test speed

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.220 
go back to this full SSD to test speed
of<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:44.860> there's<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.580> 840<00:03:46.120> SSD<00:03:46.720> Samsung

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
of that so there's the 840 SSD Samsung

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.590 
of that so there's the 840 SSD Samsung
so<00:03:47.530> that's<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.950> drive<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.239> has<00:03:49.390> been

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
so that's the drive that this has been

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.949 
so that's the drive that this has been
cloned<00:03:49.930> from<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.209> clone<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.720> SSD

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
cloned from it's a clone of the SSD

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.280 
cloned from it's a clone of the SSD
drive<00:03:53.380> though<00:03:54.130> they<00:03:54.250> are<00:03:54.370> together<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.870> that's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
drive though they are together so that's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.100 
drive though they are together so that's
four<00:03:56.620> 500<00:03:57.100> gig<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.940> terabyte<00:03:58.360> with<00:03:58.540> 120

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
four 500 gig this is a terabyte with 120

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.259 
four 500 gig this is a terabyte with 120
SSD<00:03:59.530> let<00:04:00.130> me<00:04:00.190> go<00:04:00.340> ahead<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.700> put<00:04:00.820> this<00:04:00.880> in<00:04:01.060> here

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
SSD let me go ahead and put this in here

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.060 
SSD let me go ahead and put this in here
now<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.049> forgive<00:04:02.260> me<00:04:02.290> I'm<00:04:02.560> not<00:04:02.769> going<00:04:02.980> to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
now just forgive me I'm not going to

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.160 
now just forgive me I'm not going to
mount<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.519> in<00:04:03.850> its<00:04:04.030> case<00:04:04.299> like<00:04:04.810> probably<00:04:05.140> I

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
mount it in its case like probably I

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.050 
mount it in its case like probably I
should<00:04:05.410> do<00:04:05.590> they<00:04:06.519> get<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.760> earth<00:04:06.850> themselves

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
should do they get the earth themselves

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.880 
should do they get the earth themselves
anyway<00:04:07.660> I'm<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.080> going<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.260> go<00:04:08.560> ahead<00:04:08.680> and
