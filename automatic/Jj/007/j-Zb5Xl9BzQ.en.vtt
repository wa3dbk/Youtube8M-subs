the<00:01:54.270> piston<00:01:54.510> back<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:56.190> people<00:01:56.520> will<00:01:56.760> take

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
the piston back in some people will take

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.910 
the piston back in some people will take
everything<00:01:57.390> off<00:01:57.660> use<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> C<00:01:58.230> clamp<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
everything off use a C clamp on it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
everything off use a C clamp on it
that's<00:01:59.160> fine<00:01:59.370> I've<00:01:59.670> got<00:02:00.120> a<00:02:00.150> tool<00:02:00.360> made<00:02:00.600> for

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that's fine I've got a tool made for

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:19.260 
that's fine I've got a tool made for
that<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.260> that's<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:01.980> to<00:02:02.040> use

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.770 

if<00:02:19.870> your<00:02:20.800> brake<00:02:21.070> master<00:02:21.370> cylinder<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.150> full<00:02:22.600> of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
if your brake master cylinder is full of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.810 
if your brake master cylinder is full of
fluid<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.650> do<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.220> will<00:02:24.400> overflow

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
fluid and you do this it will overflow

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.990 
fluid and you do this it will overflow
luckily<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.660> one<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.020> pretty<00:02:26.950> low<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.190> fluid

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.860 

okay<00:02:31.000> I've<00:02:31.930> got<00:02:32.490> piston<00:02:33.490> pushed<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.210> can

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
okay I've got piston pushed in I can

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.510 
okay I've got piston pushed in I can
remove<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.320> pads<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.860> end<00:02:36.040> board<00:02:36.250> pad<00:02:36.490> just

now<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.720> remove<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.200> rotor<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
now I'm going to remove the rotor and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.660 
now I'm going to remove the rotor and
clean<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.380> slides<00:03:11.710> here<00:03:12.130> where<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.430> pads

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
clean the slides here where the pads

parts<00:03:19.150> cleaner<00:03:19.740> clean<00:03:20.740> rag<00:03:23.640> if<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.790> get<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.940> lot

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
parts cleaner clean rag if you get a lot

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.270 
parts cleaner clean rag if you get a lot
of<00:03:25.270> rust<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.720> can<00:03:25.870> use<00:03:26.080> some<00:03:26.380> sandpaper<00:03:26.920> on

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
of rust you can use some sandpaper on

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:44.300 
of rust you can use some sandpaper on
there<00:03:27.460> too

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:04:03.460 

little<00:03:45.310> bit<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.490> anti-seize
