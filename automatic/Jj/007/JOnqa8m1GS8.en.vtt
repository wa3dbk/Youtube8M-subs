00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.000
 that we can see is difficult difficult mario 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.040
 this many times this power to understand what 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.560
 what are you seeing yes yes here 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.420
 definitely that we can always 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 when we do an ultrasound that 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.410
 we do in the office we do it for 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.210
 another way always do it vaginally 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.580
 it's a little bit we approach a little bit 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.040
 more to the tissues clear then if what 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 that we can be seeing here if I do not know 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.030
 if you are looking at the camera if 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.920
 you decide we can see this part quote from 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 here it is difficult it is difficult when the eye 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.940
 you're not used to, we can see this 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.010
 part of here made us reach a 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.380
 little bit darker we will reach to 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.860
 measure the uterus the uterus if we take it from 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.680
 this part to this part if it is the uterus 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.240
 let's take it in two measures here 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.369
 we can see julie's uterus that the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.649
 uterus lives approximately measures about 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.110
 five centimeters by two centimeters is 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.610
 a uterus that looks very normal to inside 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.390
 of the uterus we see a hairline 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.780
 now 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.510
 but in the clown 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.770
 we can see there you see the endometrium that 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.660
 we can see a metro world that is a 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.510
 little thickened depends a lot on what 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.110
 moment of the cycle this we treat it 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.910
 locate the ovaries 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 probably here we may be seeing 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.610
 one of the ovaries where you see the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.620
 glasses and where you do not see that there is 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 no type of cyst can not see anything 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.660
 we can see here clearly the users 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.490
 I understand that it may be difficult for the eye 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.050
 that is not used but here 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.230
 we can see one of the ovaries that the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.150
 ovary also very normal is not seen 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.540
 no alteration is all very normal 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.130
 so we can really stay very 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.520
 quiet with julie I do not know 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.340
 absolutely nothing else what 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.459
 Hit me wonder oh sorry me and me 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.020
 I'm ending this to see here is 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.890
 the assistant that will take his 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.330
 people 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.330
 look at the applause 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.440
 the production very something allows me 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.810
 what brings you 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.810
 a little bottle of bush and whiskey 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.569
 let me be the vector if you did not detect it 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.410
 but it must be because although its 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.410
 fame to this woman 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.989
