00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
like this but we're not sure so we just

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.740

have this one to compare we didn't build
this<00:00:20.020> one<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.880> just<00:00:22.240> bought<00:00:22.449> it

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
it's diecast like this and we got it

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.630 
it's diecast like this and we got it
from<00:00:26.730> Sarge's<00:00:27.730> surplus<00:00:27.760> and<00:00:28.420> cars<00:00:28.779> land<00:00:28.990> at

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
from Sarge's surplus and cars land at

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.070 
from Sarge's surplus and cars land at
California<00:00:30.640> winter<00:00:30.820> and<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.599> cannot<00:00:31.869> buy

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
California winter and you cannot buy

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.290 
California winter and you cannot buy
these<00:00:32.140> toys<00:00:32.619> any<00:00:32.920> place<00:00:33.250> else<00:00:33.519> they<00:00:33.970> might

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
these toys any place else they might

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.850 
these toys any place else they might
sell<00:00:34.570> them<00:00:34.720> on<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:34.870> Internet<00:00:34.989> but<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.589> don't

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
sell them on the Internet but I don't

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.920 
sell them on the Internet but I don't
think<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.309> because<00:00:36.850> we<00:00:37.120> have<00:00:37.149> not<00:00:37.420> seen<00:00:37.719> them

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
think so because we have not seen them

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.190 
think so because we have not seen them
anyplace<00:00:38.500> else<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.300> now<00:00:40.690> I'm<00:00:40.780> going<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:41.050> open

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
anyplace else so now I'm going to open

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200 
anyplace else so now I'm going to open
it<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.890> we're<00:00:42.340> gonna<00:00:42.460> leave<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.850> camera<00:00:43.180> on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
it and we're gonna leave the camera on

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.630 
it and we're gonna leave the camera on
why<00:00:43.629> we<00:00:43.809> put<00:00:44.020> it<00:00:44.050> together<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:45.100> we<00:00:45.280> have<00:00:45.460> that

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
why we put it together and we have that

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.600 
why we put it together and we have that
right<00:00:45.820> there<00:00:45.879> once<00:00:46.390> again<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.530> red<00:00:47.710> one<00:00:47.950> for

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
right there once again the red one for

00:00:48.610 --> 00:01:04.130 
right there once again the red one for
comparison

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.480 

so<00:01:05.140> we<00:01:05.289> have<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.560> start<00:01:05.799> with<00:01:06.100> our<00:01:06.929> chassis<00:01:07.929> x'

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so we have to start with our chassis x'

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.889 
so we have to start with our chassis x'
right<00:01:09.490> mm-hmm<00:01:11.969> and<00:01:12.969> then<00:01:13.149> we<00:01:13.420> have<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.719> put

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
right mm-hmm and then we have to put

00:01:13.899 --> 00:02:24.730 
right mm-hmm and then we have to put
this<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.500> there

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:42.160 

I<00:02:37.840> think<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:38.960> got<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> car<00:02:39.500> together<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:41.170> this

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
I think we got a car together but this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.100 
I think we got a car together but this
was<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.890> smaller<00:02:43.490> than<00:02:43.940> my<00:02:44.060> diecast<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:44.960> you

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
was it smaller than my diecast one you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.060 
was it smaller than my diecast one you
could<00:02:45.320> buy<00:02:45.350> Oh<00:02:46.010> lots<00:02:46.880> more<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:48.440> it's<00:02:48.710> funner

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
could buy Oh lots more but it's funner

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.280 
could buy Oh lots more but it's funner
to<00:02:49.400> build<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.970> then<00:02:50.960> just<00:02:51.320> buy<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:53.630> this

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
to build it then just buy it and it this

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.860 
to build it then just buy it and it this
is<00:02:54.560> like<00:02:54.710> about<00:02:55.040> six<00:02:55.490> seven<00:02:56.240> dollars<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.780> this

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
is like about six seven dollars and this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.750 
is like about six seven dollars and this
is<00:02:57.020> only<00:02:57.170> nine<00:02:57.530> dollars<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:58.250> build<00:02:58.490> your<00:02:58.700> own

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
is only nine dollars to build your own

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.810 
is only nine dollars to build your own
so<00:02:59.270> it's<00:02:59.450> pretty<00:02:59.720> fun<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> would<00:03:01.340> get<00:03:01.550> this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
so it's pretty fun so I would get this

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.790 
so it's pretty fun so I would get this
one<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.330> start<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:03.050> because<00:03:03.680> you

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
one and start this one because you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.140 
one and start this one because you
couldn't<00:03:04.130> do<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> however<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> want<00:03:04.940> you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
couldn't do it however you want you

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.640 
couldn't do it however you want you
could<00:03:05.270> do<00:03:05.450> two<00:03:05.660> seats<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.110> front<00:03:06.260> three<00:03:06.620> in

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
could do two seats in the front three in

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.820 
could do two seats in the front three in
the<00:03:06.770> back<00:03:06.920> three<00:03:07.610> three<00:03:07.910> or<00:03:07.940> two<00:03:08.750> two<00:03:08.960> however

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
the back three three or two two however

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.950 
the back three three or two two however
you<00:03:10.100> want<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:11.210> could<00:03:11.330> pick<00:03:11.540> your<00:03:11.690> eyes

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
you want and you could pick your eyes

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.820 
you want and you could pick your eyes
and<00:03:12.590> everything<00:03:13.990> so<00:03:14.990> I<00:03:15.020> think<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.590> funner

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
and everything so I think it's funner

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.270 
and everything so I think it's funner
and<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:18.110> don't<00:03:18.290> want<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.560> lose<00:03:18.740> your<00:03:18.950> extra

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
parts because you always could change it

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.630 
parts because you always could change it
