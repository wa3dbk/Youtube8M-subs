the brakes well I think it's all of the
above

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

plus<00:00:38.219> another<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:39.000> distinct<00:00:39.390> quality<00:00:39.809> if

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
plus another very distinct quality if

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
plus another very distinct quality if
you<00:00:40.290> remember<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:40.980> CLS<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:41.610> he<00:00:41.670> came

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you remember the first CLS when he came

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
you remember the first CLS when he came
out<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.210> very<00:00:42.570> bold<00:00:42.870> an<00:00:43.079> audacious<00:00:43.320> move

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
out it was very bold an audacious move

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.529 
out it was very bold an audacious move
on<00:00:43.920> Mercedes<00:00:44.190> Benzes<00:00:44.700> side<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.420> they

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
on Mercedes Benzes side because they

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209

own little segment but that's a very
good<00:02:47.350> thing<00:02:47.680> though<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.250> beautiful<00:02:48.820> design

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
good thing though this beautiful design

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.099 
good thing though this beautiful design
I<00:02:49.390> am<00:02:49.870> pretty<00:02:50.290> sure<00:02:50.380> will<00:02:50.709> age<00:02:50.950> as<00:02:51.459> well<00:02:51.940> as<00:02:52.180> a

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
I am pretty sure will age as well as a

00:02:53.109 --> 00:03:06.860 
I am pretty sure will age as well as a
classical<00:02:53.769> Chianti

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.720 

so<00:03:07.870> being<00:03:08.170> here<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.440> Florence<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.069> day<00:03:09.250> ends

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
so being here in Florence the day ends

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.479 
so being here in Florence the day ends
and<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.209> have<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.480> say<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.890> arguably<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
and I have to say this is arguably the

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.819 
and I have to say this is arguably the
capital<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.239> Renaissance<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.440> Arts

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
capital of the Renaissance and of Arts

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.850 
capital of the Renaissance and of Arts
so<00:03:15.610> what<00:03:16.420> better<00:03:16.569> place<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.200> say<00:03:17.500> goodbye<00:03:17.799> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
so what better place to say goodbye to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.910 
so what better place to say goodbye to
the<00:03:18.129> CLS<00:03:18.640> Shooting<00:03:19.110> Brake<00:03:20.110> which<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.890> a

the CLS Shooting Brake which is a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.670 
the CLS Shooting Brake which is a
masterful<00:03:21.819> piece<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.390> design<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.049> who<00:03:23.440> says

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
masterful piece of design and who says

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680 
masterful piece of design and who says
that<00:03:23.890> design<00:03:24.220> can't<00:03:24.519> be<00:03:24.670> practical<00:03:25.239> that's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
that design can't be practical that's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.289 
that design can't be practical that's
exactly<00:03:26.349> what<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> CLS<00:03:27.069> Shooting<00:03:27.310> Brake<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:28.090> I

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
exactly what the CLS Shooting Brake is I

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.780
