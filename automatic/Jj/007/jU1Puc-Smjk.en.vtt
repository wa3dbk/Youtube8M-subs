00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
time but this like I said it's just the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.040 
time but this like I said it's just the
common<00:01:04.339> time<00:01:05.830> behind<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.010> time<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:07.790> have<00:01:08.710> sage

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
common time behind the time we have sage

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.410 
common time behind the time we have sage
your<00:01:12.050> sage<00:01:12.440> sage<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.160> a<00:01:13.190> perennial<00:01:13.490> plant<00:01:13.910> so

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
your sage sage is a perennial plant so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.600 
your sage sage is a perennial plant so
it<00:01:14.600> dies<00:01:14.810> down<00:01:14.840> back<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.710> roots<00:01:16.070> after<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
it dies down back to the roots after the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.670 
it dies down back to the roots after the
first<00:01:16.850> frost<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.690> then<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.230> will<00:01:18.320> come<00:01:18.530> back

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
first frost and then it will come back

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.900 
first frost and then it will come back
in<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.040> spring<00:01:20.590> behind<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.890> we<00:01:22.190> have<00:01:22.220> lemon

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
in the spring behind that we have lemon

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.780 
in the spring behind that we have lemon
balm<00:01:23.120> and<00:01:23.920> lemon<00:01:24.920> balm<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.220> really<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.490> more<00:01:25.730> of

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790

the ground to keep it from spreading

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.010 
the ground to keep it from spreading
because<00:02:14.450> it's

because it's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.920 
because it's
very<00:02:15.170> invasive<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.920> spreads<00:02:16.220> by<00:02:16.280> roots<00:02:16.930> over
