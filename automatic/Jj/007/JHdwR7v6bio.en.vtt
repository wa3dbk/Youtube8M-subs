 it's not easy, it's not easy to get 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.849
 The counterpoint is not what is not 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.330
 As you analyze every good whore 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:42.860

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.599

 Of course, with these hooks he says that 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.140

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.260
 larger fish clear clear yes 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.900

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.680
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.129
 and our role in this game 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.979
 perfect because we have to pay 5000 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.779
 and we have achieved the total weight and we 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.729
 we have passed the area and do not say no 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:38.770
 because it's amazing what we just 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.779
 do because it has been impressive in 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.689
 this great game that does not have any 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:46.240
 grace and that goes fishing clearly yes 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.789
 as not, because we have arrived so far 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.879
 with the hook and if I hit you we will not go 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:54.819
 maybe maybe play more this would be 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.740
 abuse I do not think that until now with 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:58.629
 this can you say host 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.759

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:02.439
 is also in steam if what is 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.589
