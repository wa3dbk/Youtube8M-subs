00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
muttering so all my future it's a Tegra

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.359 
muttering so all my future it's a Tegra
3<00:01:51.000> quad-core<00:01:51.570> processor<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> means

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
3 quad-core processor which it means

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.709 
3 quad-core processor which it means
it's<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.240> fast<00:01:55.579> like<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> pop<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> web<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it's very fast like a pop of the web and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.060 
it's very fast like a pop of the web and
you'll<00:01:57.990> come<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.579> as<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.820> need<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.090> count

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you'll come up as I need to count

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270 
you'll come up as I need to count
so<00:02:03.070> it's<00:02:03.220> very<00:02:03.520> nice<00:02:03.850> um<00:02:04.290> there's<00:02:05.290> 12<00:02:05.740> GPU

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
so it's very nice um there's 12 GPU

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.540 
so it's very nice um there's 12 GPU
processes<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.060> 12<00:02:07.890> quad<00:02:08.890> core<00:02:09.160> processor

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
processes and 12 quad core processor

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.110 
processes and 12 quad core processor
which<00:02:10.119> means<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.780> has<00:02:11.370> 16<00:02:12.370> passengers<00:02:12.760> in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
which means that it has 16 passengers in

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.640 
which means that it has 16 passengers in
in<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.640> um<00:02:15.640> features<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:16.810> called<00:02:17.050> project

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
in here um features then called project

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.070 
in here um features then called project
butter<00:02:17.860> which<00:02:18.459> means<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:19.150> will<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.900> have

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
butter which means it will just have

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.340 
butter which means it will just have
much<00:02:20.470> better<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.670> experience<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.840> much

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
much better on experience and much

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.540 
much better on experience and much
better<00:02:23.620> you'll<00:02:24.430> be<00:02:24.610> much<00:02:24.760> more<00:02:24.819> smoother<00:02:26.550> than

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
better you'll be much more smoother than

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.270 
better you'll be much more smoother than
ice<00:02:28.150> cream<00:02:28.209> sandwich<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.350> does<00:02:29.680> come<00:02:30.010> in

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
ice cream sandwich it does come in

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.940 
ice cream sandwich it does come in
