00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
a kid if it's the same thing which it

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.060 
a kid if it's the same thing which it
probably<00:00:33.969> is<00:00:34.359> and<00:00:34.629> my<00:00:35.140> mom<00:00:35.350> used<00:00:35.589> to<00:00:35.679> watch<00:00:35.829> it

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
probably is and my mom used to watch it

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.099 
probably is and my mom used to watch it
all<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.339> time<00:00:36.550> you<00:00:36.820> know<00:00:36.969> he<00:00:37.629> was<00:00:37.780> just<00:00:37.899> him

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
all the time you know he was just him

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.319 
all the time you know he was just him
standing<00:00:38.559> by<00:00:38.620> his<00:00:38.949> car<00:00:39.250> in<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.670> darkness<00:00:40.089> and

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
standing by his car in the darkness and

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.869 
standing by his car in the darkness and
shit<00:00:40.539> and<00:00:40.690> solve<00:00:40.989> crimes<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:41.769> all<00:00:42.309> that<00:00:42.579> stuff

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
shit and solve crimes and all that stuff

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.450 
shit and solve crimes and all that stuff
so<00:00:42.910> I<00:00:43.179> guess<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.050> equalizer<00:00:44.559> was<00:00:44.949> this<00:00:45.190> shit

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
so I guess the equalizer was this shit
