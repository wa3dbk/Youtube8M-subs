FMS first thing you want to do is remove
the<00:00:32.689> grub<00:00:38.500> then<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.650> tricky<00:00:39.980> part<00:00:40.250> comes<00:00:40.550> up

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
the grub then the tricky part comes up

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.680 
the grub then the tricky part comes up
there<00:00:43.130> is<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.310> very<00:00:43.970> small<00:00:48.220> flathead<00:00:49.220> Phillips

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
there is a very small flathead Phillips

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.420 
there is a very small flathead Phillips
that<00:00:50.690> holds<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.110> scissors<00:00:51.500> together

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.289

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
once it's removed the scissors will come

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.260 
once it's removed the scissors will come
apart<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> next<00:01:13.170> step<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
apart and the next step and you have to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
apart and the next step and you have to
do<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.570> compression<00:01:16.079> here<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.770> push

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
do a little compression here just push

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
do a little compression here just push
down<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.969> the<00:01:18.299> upper<00:01:19.020> strut<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> little

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
down on the upper strut just a little

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.300

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
now the next step because I'm going to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
now the next step because I'm going to
be<00:01:37.979> putting<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.790> vise<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.330> drilling

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
be putting this in a vise and drilling

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.859 
be putting this in a vise and drilling
out<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.850> top<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> strut<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> five

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
out the top of the strut for a five

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
out the top of the strut for a five
millimeter<00:01:43.110> pin<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:44.220> already<00:01:44.520> done<00:01:44.729> this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
millimeter pin I've already done this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.430 
millimeter pin I've already done this
one<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.510> gonna<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.840> through<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.140> steps

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
one but I'm gonna go through the steps

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.130 
one but I'm gonna go through the steps
you<00:01:47.310> need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.300> plastic<00:01:51.770> piece<00:01:52.770> off

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
you need to take this plastic piece off

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
you need to take this plastic piece off
now<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.190> ones<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.550> got

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
now this the ones I got

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
now this the ones I got
they<00:01:57.270> had<00:01:57.630> glued<00:01:58.050> them<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.860> not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
they had glued them on but it's not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.490 
they had glued them on but it's not
necessary<00:01:59.940> because<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.420> clamp<00:02:00.780> clamps<00:02:01.320> them

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
necessary because that clamp clamps them

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
necessary because that clamp clamps them
on<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> pretty<00:02:02.490> tight<00:02:02.700> once<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.720> get

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
on there for a pretty tight once you get

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.230 
on there for a pretty tight once you get
the<00:02:04.050> screws<00:02:04.290> back<00:02:04.649> off<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:06.060> matter

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the screws back off it's just a matter

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
the screws back off it's just a matter
of<00:02:06.330> pulling<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.780> apart<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.320> what<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.500> had<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.800> do

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of pulling it apart now what I had to do

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.310 
of pulling it apart now what I had to do
initially<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.820> was<00:02:08.940> glued<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
initially because it was glued on is I

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.759 
initially because it was glued on is I
had<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> take<00:02:10.800> my<00:02:11.070> knife<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:13.200> down<00:02:13.410> through

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
had to take my knife and go down through

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.130 
had to take my knife and go down through
the<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.400> case<00:02:14.880> halves<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.810> crack<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the the case halves here and crack it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.600 
the the case halves here and crack it
open<00:02:16.410> enough<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.220> could<00:02:17.400> pull<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
open enough so that I could pull that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.330 
open enough so that I could pull that
off<00:02:18.769> then<00:02:19.769> once<00:02:19.980> I've<00:02:20.160> done<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
off then once I've done that I have the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.580 
off then once I've done that I have the
upper<00:02:23.519> strut<00:02:23.790> arm<00:02:25.100> ready<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.340> drilled<00:02:26.640> out

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
upper strut arm ready to be drilled out

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
upper strut arm ready to be drilled out
now<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.830> upper<00:02:29.040> struts<00:02:29.400> removed

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
now if the upper struts removed

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.900 
now if the upper struts removed
I've<00:02:31.170> clamp<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.769> in<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.920> vise<00:02:32.100> I've<00:02:32.550> already

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I've clamp it in the vise I've already

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.140 
I've clamp it in the vise I've already
drilled<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.630> out<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.610> wanted<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> do

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
drilled this one out but I wanted to do

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.420 
drilled this one out but I wanted to do
this<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.569> show<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:40.560> already<00:02:40.829> drilled<00:02:41.100> out<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
this to show it's already drilled out to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.050 
this to show it's already drilled out to
five<00:02:41.640> millimeters<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.780> again<00:02:44.030> make<00:02:45.030> sure

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
five millimeters and again make sure

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.890 
five millimeters and again make sure
that<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.570> blow<00:02:45.780> all<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.110> savings<00:02:46.590> out<00:02:50.900> you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that you blow all the savings out you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.810 
that you blow all the savings out you
pretty<00:02:52.320> much<00:02:52.410> have<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.670> if

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
pretty much have to do this because if

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.699 
pretty much have to do this because if
you<00:02:53.970> don't<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.510> guarantee<00:02:55.200> you're<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.500> gonna

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you don't I guarantee you're not gonna

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.080 
you don't I guarantee you're not gonna
be<00:02:55.860> able<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.070> hold<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.400> thing<00:02:56.670> without<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
be able to hold that thing without it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.569 
be able to hold that thing without it
twisting<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.720> has<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.049> be<00:02:58.170> clamped<00:02:58.440> down<00:02:58.620> to

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
twisting it has to be clamped down to

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.550 
twisting it has to be clamped down to
keep<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.970> shaft<00:03:00.660> from<00:03:00.870> twisting<00:03:01.290> when<00:03:01.410> you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
keep that shaft from twisting when you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.780 
keep that shaft from twisting when you
go<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.769> drill<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.220> larger<00:03:02.850> hole<00:03:04.489> okay<00:03:05.489> now

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
which without a pair of tweezers is

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:32.650 
which without a pair of tweezers is
almost<00:04:11.930> impossible

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.690
