just being able to spot the two tiles
and<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.079> two<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.439> tap<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.860> or<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and know that it's two and tap it or you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.209 
and know that it's two and tap it or you
know<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.909> case<00:01:59.969> three<00:02:00.390> tiles<00:02:01.219> if

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
know like in that case three tiles if

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.100 
know like in that case three tiles if
you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.610> figure<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.909> how<00:02:03.299> many<00:02:03.360> tiles<00:02:03.750> there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110

are<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:05.009> row<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.369> makes<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.899> easier<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.170> not

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
are in a row it makes it easier to not
