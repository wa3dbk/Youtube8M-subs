enthusiasts and other internet guys
welcome<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.589> video<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:09.150> first<00:00:09.690> big

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
welcome to my video on my first big

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.650 
welcome to my video on my first big
Arduino<00:00:10.679> project<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.550> call<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.880> tre

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
Arduino project which I call the tre

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.730 
Arduino project which I call the tre
clock<00:00:13.730> as<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.120> name<00:00:15.299> if<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.500> don't<00:00:16.529> know

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
clock as for the name if you don't know

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060 
clock as for the name if you don't know
what<00:00:16.859> tre<00:00:17.130> means<00:00:18.050> basically<00:00:19.050> every<00:00:19.500> side<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
what tre means basically every side of a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
what tre means basically every side of a
die<00:00:20.340> has<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.600> name<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.359> called<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
die has a name the one is called the a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.140 
die has a name the one is called the a
so<00:00:25.019> most<00:00:25.439> people<00:00:25.560> done<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.189> too<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
so most people done that one too is

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
so most people done that one too is
called<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> deuce<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.289> people<00:00:28.560> know<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
called the deuce some people know that

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.569 
called the deuce some people know that
one<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> tennis<00:00:30.179> term<00:00:31.579> some

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
one I think it's a tennis term some

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.389 
one I think it's a tennis term some
people<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> tray<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.620> many<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
people know the tray but not many and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.819 
people know the tray but not many and
that<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.000> three<00:00:37.579> three<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.610> called<00:00:38.820> tray<00:00:39.300> um

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
that is three three is called tray um

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
that is three three is called tray um
which<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.860> why<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> call<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> tray<00:00:42.510> clock

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
which is why I call this the tray clock

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
which is why I call this the tray clock
because<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> has<00:00:43.500> three<00:00:43.920> functions

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because it has three functions

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.510 
because it has three functions
um<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.739> rest<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
um and that as for the rest of them the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.930 
um and that as for the rest of them the
forest<00:00:48.480> cater<00:00:48.750> five<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.620> sync<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> six<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
forest cater five is sync and six is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.709 
forest cater five is sync and six is
size<00:00:51.360> um<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> uh<00:00:54.860> let<00:00:55.860> me<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.090> show<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
size um so uh let me just show you the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.860 
size um so uh let me just show you the
red<00:00:57.899> board<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.710> looks<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.820> messy<00:01:00.359> um

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
red board here it's looks very messy um

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
red board here it's looks very messy um
I<00:01:01.469> had<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.770> keep<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> pretty<00:01:02.489> compact<00:01:03.030> because

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
I had to keep it pretty compact because

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
I had to keep it pretty compact because
my<00:01:03.660> wires<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.640> pretty<00:01:05.640> limited<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.180> their

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
my wires are all pretty limited in their

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.620 
my wires are all pretty limited in their
size<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.290> we've<00:01:08.280> got<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.610> LCD<00:01:08.760> screen<00:01:09.090> right

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
size but we've got an LCD screen right

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.130 
size but we've got an LCD screen right
here

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
here

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.240 
here
um<00:01:11.060> potentiometer<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.510> might<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.560> optional

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
um potentiometer which might be optional

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.929 
um potentiometer which might be optional
um<00:01:14.400> I'm<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.570> entirely<00:01:16.080> sure<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:17.850> not

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
um I'm not entirely sure if it is or not

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.429 
um I'm not entirely sure if it is or not
but<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> way<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> learned<00:01:18.990> how<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> set

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
but this is the way I learned how to set

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.539 
but this is the way I learned how to set
up<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.590> bread<00:01:19.799> bowl<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.100> an<00:01:20.189> LCD<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:22.549> just

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
up a bread bowl with an LCD so I just

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.100 
up a bread bowl with an LCD so I just
put<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> potentiometer<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.960> because

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
put the potentiometer on there because

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
put the potentiometer on there because
it<00:01:25.290> doesn't<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:26.040> matter<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.700> on

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it doesn't really matter if it's on

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.690 
it doesn't really matter if it's on
there<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> function<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
there or not the function of it is that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
there or not the function of it is that
if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> turn<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.500> it'll<00:01:31.500> turn<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> time<00:01:32.220> off

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
if you turn it it'll turn the time off

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.929 
if you turn it it'll turn the time off
the<00:01:33.060> time<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.450> keep<00:01:33.960> running<00:01:34.430> any<00:01:35.430> LCD

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the time will keep running any LCD

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.890 
the time will keep running any LCD
screen<00:01:36.329> remains<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.759> yeah<00:01:38.790> remains<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.540> but

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
screen remains on or yeah remains on but

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.280 
screen remains on or yeah remains on but
the<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> time<00:01:41.579> goes<00:01:41.820> away<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:43.200> if

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the just the time goes away and then if

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.450 
the just the time goes away and then if
you<00:01:43.350> turn<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> other<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.280> bunch

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
you turn it the other way just a bunch

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.109 
you turn it the other way just a bunch
of<00:01:44.520> white<00:01:44.700> blocks<00:01:45.030> appear<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:47.119> practical

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
of white blocks appear so practical

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.440 
of white blocks appear so practical
purpose<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.729> just<00:01:50.729> left<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.119> because

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
purpose but I just left it there because

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.010 
purpose but I just left it there because
it's<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.409> necessary<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.009> take<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> off

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
it's not really necessary to take it off

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.690 
it's not really necessary to take it off
you've<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> pH<00:01:55.530> sub<00:01:55.710> buzzer<00:01:55.890> down<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.369> here

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you've got a pH sub buzzer down in here

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.170 
you've got a pH sub buzzer down in here
um<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:58.049> goes<00:01:58.350> off<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.399> timer<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.240> up

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
um that goes off when the timer is up

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.450 
um that goes off when the timer is up
because<00:02:03.180> most<00:02:03.689> people<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.799> when

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
because most people like to know when

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.300 
because most people like to know when
the<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.770> done<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.440> last<00:02:11.039> you've

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the time is done so and then last you've

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.820 
the time is done so and then last you've
got<00:02:11.459> these<00:02:11.550> three<00:02:11.790> buttons<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.300> here

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
got these three buttons up here

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
got these three buttons up here
um<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> far<00:02:14.930> left<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.410> call<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
um this one on the far left I call the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.610 
um this one on the far left I call the
mode<00:02:16.280> button<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:17.000> because<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.780> changes

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
mode button that's because it changes

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.770 
mode button that's because it changes
the<00:02:18.680> mode<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:20.180> Arduino<00:02:20.630> you've<00:02:21.320> got<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
the mode of the Arduino you've got the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.100

glitches<00:02:30.560> here<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:32.000> don't<00:02:32.510> really<00:02:33.320> know<00:02:33.590> what

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
glitches here I don't really know what

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.670 
glitches here I don't really know what
causes<00:02:34.220> those<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.260> speculate<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.560> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
causes those I speculate that it's a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.830 
causes those I speculate that it's a
power<00:02:37.250> problem<00:02:37.640> but<00:02:38.090> I'm<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.300> entirely<00:02:38.630> sure

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
power problem but I'm not entirely sure

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.870 
power problem but I'm not entirely sure
I<00:02:39.410> don't<00:02:39.530> think<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:40.190> has<00:02:40.310> anything<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.850> with

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
I don't think it has anything to do with

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.280 
I don't think it has anything to do with
the<00:02:41.060> program<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:41.720> could<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.470> wrong<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
the program I could be wrong on but it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.060 
the program I could be wrong on but it
is<00:02:45.410> what<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.860> um<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:48.470> unfortunate

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
is what it is um and it's unfortunate

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.700 
is what it is um and it's unfortunate
but<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.480> functions<00:02:50.960> correctly<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.680> I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
but it's the functions correctly so I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.960 
but it's the functions correctly so I
don't<00:02:52.160> mind<00:02:52.460> too<00:02:52.700> much<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:55.220> button<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.880> the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
don't mind too much this button in the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.330 
don't mind too much this button in the
middle<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.330> call<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.870> start/stop<00:02:57.650> button<00:02:57.680> if

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
I push it and here's more visual

call the restart button and when I click

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.460 
call the restart button and when I click
that<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:13.250> timer<00:03:13.490> restarts<00:03:14.150> if<00:03:15.050> we're<00:03:15.200> over<00:03:15.380> in

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.240 
glitches I push the start/stop button
again<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.290> will<00:03:24.380> pause<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.770> time<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
again and it will pause the time and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.590 
again and it will pause the time and
then<00:03:25.430> reset<00:03:25.880> will<00:03:26.510> set<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.930> back<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.320> zero<00:03:27.590> and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
then reset will set it back to zero and

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.880 
then reset will set it back to zero and

want to show that in the timer function
I<00:03:37.989> set<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.140> 10<00:03:39.380> seconds<00:03:39.770> because<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.160> figured

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
I set it to 10 seconds because I figured

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.910 
I set it to 10 seconds because I figured

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
that has all the information on the code

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.100 
that has all the information on the code
the<00:04:33.750> light<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.350> breadboard<00:04:34.860> lay<00:04:35.040> out<00:04:35.190> the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
the light the breadboard lay out the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.360 
the light the breadboard lay out the
materials<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.169> need<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.350> make<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.130> a

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
materials you need to make this and a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.330 
materials you need to make this and a
bunch<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.610> other<00:04:38.760> stuff<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.060> check<00:04:39.419> that<00:04:39.449> out

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
bunch of other stuff so check that out

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.320 
bunch of other stuff so check that out
one<00:04:41.340> last<00:04:41.490> thing<00:04:41.669> I<00:04:41.790> wanted<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.120> address

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
one last thing I wanted to address

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.620 
one last thing I wanted to address
before<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.810> ended<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.380> video<00:04:43.620> was<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.729> had

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
before I ended the video was that I had

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.200 
before I ended the video was that I had
the<00:04:45.660> idea<00:04:46.169> for<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:47.540> alarm<00:04:48.540> function<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.139> here<00:04:49.410> um

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
the idea for a alarm function on here um

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.820 
the idea for a alarm function on here um
my<00:04:51.210> vision<00:04:51.900> when<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.050> first<00:04:52.320> made<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.650> was

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
my vision when I first made this was

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.189 
my vision when I first made this was
that<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.250> would<00:04:53.340> be<00:04:53.370> similar<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.240> modern

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
that it would be similar to a modern

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.850 
that it would be similar to a modern
digital<00:04:55.770> watch<00:04:56.010> um<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.289> mostly<00:04:58.590> is

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
digital watch um and and it mostly is

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.650 
digital watch um and and it mostly is
but<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.460> one<00:04:59.639> thing<00:04:59.820> that<00:04:59.940> it's<00:05:00.060> lacking<00:05:00.479> is

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
but the one thing that it's lacking is

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.439 
but the one thing that it's lacking is
an<00:05:00.810> alarm<00:05:01.139> function<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:05.180> wanted<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.240> add

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
an alarm function and so I wanted to add

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.460 
an alarm function and so I wanted to add
that<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.680> actually<00:05:08.190> did<00:05:08.820> write<00:05:09.750> a<00:05:09.810> code<00:05:10.169> for

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
that and I actually did write a code for

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.710 
that and I actually did write a code for
it<00:05:10.500> which<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> can<00:05:10.979> find<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.280> my<00:05:11.310> website<00:05:11.720> but

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
it which you can find on my website but

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.960 
it which you can find on my website but
it<00:05:13.440> didn't<00:05:14.010> work<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.520> I'm<00:05:14.639> not<00:05:14.760> quite<00:05:14.910> sure

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
it didn't work and I'm not quite sure

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.670 
it didn't work and I'm not quite sure
why<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:15.660> it's<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:15.870> work<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.110> progress<00:05:16.169> it's

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
why so it's a work in progress it's

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.629 
why so it's a work in progress it's
something<00:05:16.949> I<00:05:17.010> might<00:05:17.160> want<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.370> do<00:05:17.460> in<00:05:17.580> the

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
something I might want to do in the

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.939 
something I might want to do in the
future<00:05:17.940> but<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.150> haven't<00:05:18.780> quite<00:05:19.229> finished<00:05:19.650> it

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
future but I haven't quite finished it

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.420 
future but I haven't quite finished it
yet<00:05:20.160> um<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.350> don't<00:05:22.590> know<00:05:22.860> hopefully<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:23.310> can

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
yet um so I don't know hopefully I can

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.040 
yet um so I don't know hopefully I can
figure<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:23.760> out<00:05:23.820> but<00:05:24.300> this<00:05:24.600> is<00:05:24.660> what<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:24.900> have

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
figure that out but this is what I have

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.080 
figure that out but this is what I have
so<00:05:25.199> far<00:05:25.229> I<00:05:25.590> also<00:05:26.160> want<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.400> fix<00:05:26.550> those<00:05:26.729> visual

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
so far I also want to fix those visual

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.350 
so far I also want to fix those visual
glitches<00:05:27.360> some<00:05:28.229> point<00:05:28.440> in<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.560> future<00:05:28.650> but

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
glitches some point in the future but

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.430 
glitches some point in the future but
this<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.450> my<00:05:30.570> project<00:05:30.720> I<00:05:31.020> hope<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.349> guys

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
this is my project I hope you guys

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.090 
this is my project I hope you guys
enjoyed<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.099> thank<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.580> for<00:05:32.729> watching
