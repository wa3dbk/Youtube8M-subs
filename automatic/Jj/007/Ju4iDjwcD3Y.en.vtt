00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
this is more of a you want to think of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.610

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
because more of the stamp will be

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.490 
because more of the stamp will be
reflected<00:01:03.969> instead<00:01:04.719> of<00:01:04.839> something<00:01:05.199> more<00:01:05.350> like

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
reflected instead of something more like
