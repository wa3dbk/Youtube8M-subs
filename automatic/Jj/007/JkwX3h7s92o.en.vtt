00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.920 
not really free but so let me tell you
some<00:00:33.059> advantages<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.559> disadvantages

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
some advantages and some disadvantages

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.510 
some advantages and some disadvantages
advantage<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.340> App<00:00:38.489> Store

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
advantage is that it's on the App Store

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.889 
advantage is that it's on the App Store
and<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.840> it's<00:00:43.250> well<00:00:44.390> free<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.690> get

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and that and that it's well free to get

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.939 
and that and that it's well free to get
it<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:50.870> disadvantage<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it a disadvantage it's all so that you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.020 
it a disadvantage it's all so that you
can<00:00:53.100> record<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.850> Safari<00:00:54.420> music<00:00:55.199> everything

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
can record the Safari music everything

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.220 
can record the Safari music everything
every<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.390> encode<00:00:57.629> pretty<00:00:58.050> much

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
every you can encode pretty much

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
every you can encode pretty much
everything<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.309> open<00:00:59.930> GL<00:01:01.129> es<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.430> apps<00:01:02.789> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
everything but not open GL es is apps so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
everything but not open GL es is apps so
that<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> disadvantage<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.280> cannot

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that is the disadvantage that you cannot

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.440 
that is the disadvantage that you cannot
make<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.110> cannot<00:01:07.380> record<00:01:07.979> OpenGL<00:01:08.700> ES<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
make it you cannot record OpenGL ES and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.140 
make it you cannot record OpenGL ES and
that<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.140> means<00:01:10.439> um<00:01:11.900> minecraft<00:01:14.150> jean-jacques

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that it means um minecraft jean-jacques

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770 
that it means um minecraft jean-jacques
X<00:01:15.650> pretty<00:01:16.650> much<00:01:16.890> every<00:01:17.280> game<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.330> GL

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
X pretty much every game that is GL

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
X pretty much every game that is GL
yeses<00:01:19.640> GLS<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.830> yeah<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.159> bad

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
yeses GLS and yeah this is a pretty bad

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.870
