00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 in the Vladimir region found something 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 very reminiscent of a mutant from the movie 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
 horror stranger showed up in the usual puddle 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
 remotely similar to shrimp but very 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 terrible however in the family which his 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 found they were frightened on the contrary thought 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.340
 dies useful for monster skills 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 brought home washed and then it turned out 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 the most interesting is the oldest on earth 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.600
 being elinor smoking and conceived 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 may have something to learn that you long 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 live armor two eyes mustache tail and 70 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 pair of legs 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 It is better than a dog at the Botkin family. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.250
 Vladimir region appeared unique 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 a pet 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 looks daunting but george botkin 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.950
 happy anyway 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 it was the child who found the crustacean 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.360
 being the size of a finger in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.539
 ordinary rural puddles I saw 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.469
 a creature that moves 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.930
 I then ran to my mother to say that to us 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.789
 need some kind of creature yet unknown 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 Botkin body swiftly swam in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.739
 improvised aquarium conventional pelvis 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 the whole family studied the Internet residents 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
 Rena can really be proud 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.100
 finding a ditch in the ditch 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 this is the oldest creature on the planet 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 famous scientist teacher lived on earth 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
 230 million years ago on a single 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.080
 then continent pangea 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.509
 when there were only dinosaurs and have 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 plants there were no flowers but the main thing is that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.479
 learned botkin and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.479
 the guest from the past is not aggressive and not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.490
 poisonous does not bite anything that is harm 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.799
 no he can bring me 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 practically lives itself apart but 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.329
 really short about a month but 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.400
 unpretentious in eating the most important teacher 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.320
 predator of its ecological niche and this 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 It means to eat all who are less than him 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.280
 scary to imagine what will happen if 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 the bristles of the arms will grow like something 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 burst out 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.740
 scientists calm and for 230 million 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.020
 years morphologically look not changed 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.330
 although there are very few specialists in the world 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.860
 studying body for example 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.810
 on his ten centimeter body there is 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.240
 process that resembles the organ of vision 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.110
 but the natural sensor function is still 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.850
 unknown 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.490
 and the principle is still not clear 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.739
 breeding scientists have set a shield not in 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.970
 mostly females lay eggs but 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.730
 meet and males 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.680
 maybe here is the secret of survival or how 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 writes fiction future salvation 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.280
 of humanity 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.800
 scientists are not so optimistic they can 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.260
 wait at least two years 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.260
 state of anabiosis i.e. Lydians 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.190
 and then when arises in already good 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.500
 the weather is natural for them 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.690
 multiply and go out the teacher from 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.430
 Yurina village has not yet turned into 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.320
 the male he doesn't do anything at all 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.300
 suspicious botkin caused 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.700
 urban scientists but already doubt 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.040
 his decision may have been worth letting go 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.260
 guests at will shield not very fond of puddles 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.930
 ditches small ponds where there is no 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.210
 natural enemies there they continue 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.830
 find your ancient clan and lian arch
