00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
fast and be independent from the rest of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
his body like Michael Flatley lord of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
his body like Michael Flatley lord of
the<00:02:03.630> dance<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:05.250> think

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

that's<00:02:05.670> what's<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.540> I'm<00:02:07.500> thinking

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
that's what's going on here I'm thinking

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
that's what's going on here I'm thinking
he<00:02:10.560> might<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.979> metallo

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
he might be metallo

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.360 
he might be metallo
huh<00:02:13.170> yeah<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:15.480> my<00:02:15.780> guess<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.620> has<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.099> it

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
huh yeah that's my guess it has to it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.670 
huh yeah that's my guess it has to it
has<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.879> with<00:02:18.150> something<00:02:18.569> cybernetic<00:02:19.260> like

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
has to be with something cybernetic like

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.890 
has to be with something cybernetic like
he's<00:02:19.860> got<00:02:20.040> robot<00:02:20.370> legs<00:02:20.640> or<00:02:20.879> something<00:02:21.269> it's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
he's got robot legs or something it's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
he's got robot legs or something it's
gotta<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.349> that's<00:02:22.920> my<00:02:23.129> yet<00:02:23.400> Stan<00:02:23.760> that's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
gotta be that that's my yet Stan that's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.640 
gotta be that that's my yet Stan that's
just<00:02:24.510> what<00:02:24.629> I'm<00:02:24.780> thinking<00:02:25.080> unless<00:02:25.230> he's<00:02:25.440> just

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
just what I'm thinking unless he's just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.759 
just what I'm thinking unless he's just
missing<00:02:25.920> legs<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:27.269> uh<00:02:27.300> unless<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.410> then<00:02:28.530> hey

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
missing legs but uh unless and then hey

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.410 
missing legs but uh unless and then hey
you<00:02:28.830> never<00:02:29.040> know<00:02:29.250> maybe<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.730> Dick<00:02:30.000> Grayson

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
you never know maybe it is Dick Grayson

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.089 
you never know maybe it is Dick Grayson
and<00:02:30.480> he<00:02:30.599> lost<00:02:30.810> his<00:02:31.049> legs<00:02:31.290> maybe<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
and he lost his legs maybe they have it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.289 
and he lost his legs maybe they have it
a<00:02:32.129> little<00:02:32.310> different<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.120> never

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
a little different in this you never

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.150 
a little different in this you never
know<00:02:33.450> never<00:02:34.200> know<00:02:34.470> they<00:02:34.739> might<00:02:34.890> throw<00:02:35.129> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
know never know they might throw a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.300 
know never know they might throw a
curveball<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.910> my<00:02:36.660> guess<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:37.680> ultimate<00:02:37.890> guess

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
curveball but my guess my ultimate guess

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.820 
curveball but my guess my ultimate guess
is<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.450> he's<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
is just that he's this is like the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.880 
is just that he's this is like the
beginnings<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.580> metallo<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.720> he<00:02:43.410> first<00:02:43.709> gets

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
beginnings of metallo and he first gets

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.069 
beginnings of metallo and he first gets
robot<00:02:44.310> legs<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.880> then<00:02:45.000> maybe<00:02:45.209> Luther<00:02:45.599> fuksas

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
robot legs and then maybe Luther fuksas

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.410 
robot legs and then maybe Luther fuksas
them<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.230> little<00:02:46.380> more<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.890> he<00:02:47.819> becomes<00:02:48.209> you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
them a little more and he becomes you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.830 
them a little more and he becomes you
know<00:02:48.480> an<00:02:48.630> evil<00:02:48.930> cyborg<00:02:49.799> dude<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.690> that
