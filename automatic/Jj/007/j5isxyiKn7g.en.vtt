00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
and then this one is not very new I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.780 
and then this one is not very new I
don't<00:03:03.680> think<00:03:03.830> but<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.100> called<00:03:04.280> bobbing<00:03:04.760> for

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
don't think but it's called bobbing for

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.820 
don't think but it's called bobbing for
baubles<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:06.020> kind<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.260> made<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> darker

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
baubles and it's kind of made a darker

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.560 
baubles and it's kind of made a darker
color<00:03:07.070> but<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.460> do<00:03:07.640> like<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.090> wear<00:03:08.150> dark<00:03:08.420> colors

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
on my nails and I figured this would be

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.030 
on my nails and I figured this would be
a<00:03:10.430> better<00:03:10.870> alternative<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.900> wearing<00:03:12.740> black

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
a better alternative to wearing black

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.740 
a better alternative to wearing black
like<00:03:13.460> in<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.670> spring<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.060> summertime<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:14.660> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750
