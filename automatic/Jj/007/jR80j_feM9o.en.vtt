throughout<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> entire<00:01:57.659> album<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.560> always

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
throughout this entire album I always

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219 
throughout this entire album I always
it's<00:01:59.130> almost<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.359> the<00:02:00.539> guitar<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's almost like all of the guitar and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's almost like all of the guitar and
every<00:02:01.829> song<00:02:02.099> it's<00:02:02.459> like<00:02:02.670> well<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.329> guess

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
every song it's like well and I guess

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.120 
every song it's like well and I guess
the<00:02:03.599> whole<00:02:03.689> song<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.289> like<00:02:04.349> it's<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.829> few

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the whole song it's like it's a few

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
the whole song it's like it's a few
beats<00:02:05.399> per<00:02:05.729> minute<00:02:06.029> slower<00:02:06.479> than<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.929> feel

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
beats per minute slower than you feel

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.719 
beats per minute slower than you feel
like<00:02:07.319> it<00:02:07.439> should<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:07.979> gives<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
like it should be but it gives it it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.070 
like it should be but it gives it it
gives<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.090> kind<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.630> emotional

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

what<00:04:22.650> seems<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:23.070> be<00:04:23.160> kind<00:04:23.430> of

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
what seems to be kind of

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.290 
what seems to be kind of
very<00:04:24.560> immature<00:04:25.040> relationship<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:25.940> then<00:04:26.060> it

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
very immature relationship and then it

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.030 
very immature relationship and then it
kind<00:04:26.570> of<00:04:26.600> progresses<00:04:27.199> throughout<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.620> album

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
kind of progresses throughout the album

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.580 
kind of progresses throughout the album
and<00:04:28.220> then<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.790> know<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.210> gets<00:04:29.389> pretty<00:04:29.870> dark<00:04:30.290> by

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and then you know it gets pretty dark by

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.680 
and then you know it gets pretty dark by
the<00:04:30.650> end<00:04:30.860> some<00:04:31.070> some<00:04:31.400> bad<00:04:31.639> things<00:04:32.090> happen<00:04:32.570> to

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
the end some some bad things happen to

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.090 
the end some some bad things happen to
this<00:04:32.780> relationship<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:33.680> doesn't<00:04:33.919> end

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
this relationship and it doesn't end

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.860 
this relationship and it doesn't end
necessarily<00:04:34.970> on<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.120> good<00:04:35.360> note<00:04:35.479> which<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:35.690> why

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
necessarily on a good note which is why

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.120 
necessarily on a good note which is why
I<00:04:35.900> think<00:04:36.080> when<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.440> get<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.770> end<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
I think when you get to the end of the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.860 
I think when you get to the end of the
album<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.490> get<00:04:37.639> a<00:04:37.669> lot<00:04:37.880> more<00:04:37.910> of<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.330> emotive

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
album you get a lot more of the emotive

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.080 
album you get a lot more of the emotive
