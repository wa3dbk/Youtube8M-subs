thing as you guys saw in the beginning

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.110 
thing as you guys saw in the beginning
of<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> video<00:04:40.830> there<00:04:41.190> was<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.340> lot<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.580> burst

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
of the video there was a lot of burst

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.090 
of the video there was a lot of burst
hilling<00:04:42.540> there<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.530> reason<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
hilling there and the reason the the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.670 
hilling there and the reason the the
healing<00:04:44.730> was<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.180> high<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.660> because<00:04:45.690> like<00:04:46.560> I

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
healing was so high is because like I

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.500 
healing was so high is because like I
said<00:04:46.740> there's<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.580> lot<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:47.820> over<00:04:48.150> healing<00:04:48.420> in

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
said there's a lot of over healing in

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.830 
said there's a lot of over healing in
this<00:04:48.630> fight<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.640> think<00:04:50.640> one<00:04:50.940> one<00:04:51.420> question

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
this fight and I think one one question

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.130 
this fight and I think one one question
light<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.530> lot<00:04:53.030> after<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.300> after<00:04:54.540> these

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
light I get a lot after and after these

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.050 
light I get a lot after and after these
fights<00:04:55.380> when<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.710> do<00:04:55.770> he'll<00:04:56.070> this<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.370> how<00:04:56.910> did

you<00:04:57.210> heal<00:04:57.390> so<00:04:57.600> much<00:04:57.900> because<00:04:58.320> my<00:04:58.470> item<00:04:58.800> level

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
you heal so much because my item level

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.180
