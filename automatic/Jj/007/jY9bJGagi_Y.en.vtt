00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
got gas tank there's the clutch pulley

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
got gas tank there's the clutch pulley
drives<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.690> wheel<00:01:00.989> um<00:01:03.290> there's<00:01:04.290> my<00:01:04.530> brake

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
drives a wheel um there's my brake

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070 
drives a wheel um there's my brake
doesn't<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:05.970> work<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
doesn't really work that good it's a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
doesn't really work that good it's a
drum<00:01:07.320> brake<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> worn<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.939> um<00:01:11.270> yeah

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
drum brake it's kind of worn out um yeah

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.039 
drum brake it's kind of worn out um yeah
I've<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.960> another<00:01:13.290> um<00:01:14.750> pulley<00:01:15.750> for

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I've got I got another um pulley for

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
I've got I got another um pulley for
here<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.799> faster<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.549> know

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
here to make it go faster you know

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.429 
here to make it go faster you know
because<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.780> big<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.259> now

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
because this is pretty big right now

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.200 
because this is pretty big right now
it's<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:21.840> does<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.770> down<00:01:23.430> gearing<00:01:24.000> like

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it's like it does it's down gearing like

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's like it does it's down gearing like
both<00:01:24.720> sets<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.320> smaller<00:01:25.799> big<00:01:26.400> smaller<00:01:26.820> big

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
both sets like smaller big smaller big

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
both sets like smaller big smaller big
with<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> chain<00:01:27.900> too<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> goes<00:01:28.799> bracelet

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
with the chain too so it goes bracelet

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.870 
with the chain too so it goes bracelet
right<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:30.890> but<00:01:31.890> yeah<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.280> I'm<00:01:32.400> planning<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.810 
this dungeon is pretty worn out it's a
good<00:01:43.950> engine<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.399> work

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
good engine it work

good engine it work
everyone's<00:01:45.390> good<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
everyone's good but it's just kind of

probably<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> new<00:01:52.979> engine<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
probably put that new engine on it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.719 
probably put that new engine on it
you<00:01:54.320> can<00:01:54.500> see<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:55.010> got<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.850> throttle<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:57.580> got<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
you can see I got the throttle I got the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.000 
you can see I got the throttle I got the
carb<00:01:59.860> yeah<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.159> um<00:02:02.140> yeah<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.170> started<00:02:03.590> up<00:02:03.800> for

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
carb yeah so um yeah I started up for

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.109 
carb yeah so um yeah I started up for
you<00:02:04.130> just<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.210> show<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.900> got<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.380> ass<00:02:07.119> break

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
you just to show you I got the ass break

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.540 
you just to show you I got the ass break
oh<00:02:08.479> yeah<00:02:08.810> I'll<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.709> these<00:02:09.920> weights<00:02:10.220> in<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
oh yeah I'll have these weights in the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.699 
oh yeah I'll have these weights in the
front<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:12.200> doesn't<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
front this is it doesn't have a

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.910 
front this is it doesn't have a
differential<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:14.060> know<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.650> is

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
differential you know so it just this is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.130 
differential you know so it just this is
really<00:02:16.280> hard<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.880> turn<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.420> got<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.690> get<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> lot

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
really hard to turn you got to get a lot

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.480 
really hard to turn you got to get a lot
of<00:02:18.170> weight<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.650> front<00:02:18.800> that's<00:02:19.100> not<00:02:19.250> even

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
of weight in the front that's not even

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.020 
of weight in the front that's not even
enough

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
enough

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.690 
enough
I'd<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> car<00:02:21.110> battery<00:02:21.320> if<00:02:21.800> up<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
I'd like a car battery if up in the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.580 
I'd like a car battery if up in the
front<00:02:22.970> here<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.690> looked<00:02:23.870> kind<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.110> cool<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.500> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
front here it looked kind of cool but it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.760 
front here it looked kind of cool but it
