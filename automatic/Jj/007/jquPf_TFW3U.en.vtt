 for example we can select a point 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.030
 of interest create a trip with several 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.070
 stops enter a destination using 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.950
 certain time by having five or less 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 automatic way shows a listing 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.049

 by local orders say a 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.520

 program information that is being 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.970
 listening to its operation is correct 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.860
 even if the video does not show any 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.960
 transmitter because in the study of 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.240
 recording there is no signal the system 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.150
 audio formed by 9 speakers has a

 music we do not know if it's been in our 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.820
 unit but the system has had a bad 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.590
 functioning staying locked in 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.090
 multitude of occasions the screen 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.590
 shows a similar menu at all 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.210
 means of reproduction in the part 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.310
 central we will see basic information of 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.900

 at the bottom the search menu is 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.770
 possible to also perform a scan 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.770
 by folders 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.010
 two USB sockets one beside the reader 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.199
 sd cards under the controls of the

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.010
 both are compatible with devices 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.510
 ipad although they are connecting it to the 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.550
 making the glove we have 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.590
 reproduce it by doing so we check that 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.500
 in the search menu there are some options 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.550
 more like podcast playlists 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.550
 or audiobooks 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.350
 when playing music from a phone 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.150

 reversing camera is standard 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.630
 image is not very clear there are some guides 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.850
 that rotate in solidarity at the wheel 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.160
 we analyze the system of vocal orders 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.160
 in a specific video below a 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:33.460
 example 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.460
 navigate to valdemoro maría moliner 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.990
 valdemoro to calle maría de molina 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.460
 you want to start the route guide now yes 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.650
 and saying route guidance
