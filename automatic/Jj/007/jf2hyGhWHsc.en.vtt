hitting<00:00:10.840> behind<00:00:10.960> the<00:00:11.290> ball<00:00:11.440> so<00:00:11.980> let's<00:00:12.160> set<00:00:12.340> the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
hitting behind the ball so let's set the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.040 
hitting behind the ball so let's set the
scene<00:00:12.639> you've<00:00:12.880> driven<00:00:13.330> the<00:00:13.540> ball<00:00:13.690> down<00:00:13.900> the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.050 
scene you've driven the ball down the

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.140 
scene you've driven the ball down the
fairway<00:00:14.700> 250<00:00:15.700> yards

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
fairway 250 yards

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.400 
fairway 250 yards
you'll<00:00:16.450> stood<00:00:16.660> there<00:00:16.840> in<00:00:16.870> the<00:00:17.110> middle<00:00:17.289> of<00:00:17.350> the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
you'll stood there in the middle of the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.220 
you'll stood there in the middle of the
fairway<00:00:17.560> with<00:00:17.980> you<00:00:18.190> 6-iron<00:00:18.610> and<00:00:19.000> you<00:00:19.900> hit

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
fairway with you 6-iron and you hit

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.529 
fairway with you 6-iron and you hit
behind<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.770> golf<00:00:20.920> ball<00:00:21.250> second<00:00:22.060> shot<00:00:22.179> third

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
behind the golf ball second shot third

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.870 
behind the golf ball second shot third
shot<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.019> it<00:00:23.230> travels<00:00:23.590> about<00:00:23.740> 10<00:00:24.039> yards<00:00:24.250> okay

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
shot and it travels about 10 yards okay

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.660 
shot and it travels about 10 yards okay
so<00:00:25.300> here<00:00:25.599> are<00:00:25.689> some<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.960> causes<00:00:26.380> that

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so here are some of the causes that

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.349 
so here are some of the causes that
allow<00:00:27.670> this<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:28.029> happen

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
allow this to happen

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.190 
allow this to happen
the<00:00:29.140> first<00:00:29.349> one<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:29.830> incorrect<00:00:30.460> ball<00:00:30.609> position

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
the first one is incorrect ball position

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.180 
the first one is incorrect ball position
placing<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.259> ball<00:00:32.349> too<00:00:32.560> far<00:00:32.590> back<00:00:33.010> in<00:00:33.160> the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
placing the ball too far back in the

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.480 
placing the ball too far back in the
stance<00:00:33.490> will<00:00:34.210> mean<00:00:34.420> in<00:00:34.660> accuracy<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.770> bad

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
stance will mean in accuracy and bad

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.229 
stance will mean in accuracy and bad
contact<00:00:37.090> so<00:00:37.630> make<00:00:37.870> sure<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:39.160> ball<00:00:39.370> is<00:00:39.969> placed

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
contact so make sure the ball is placed

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.029 
contact so make sure the ball is placed
more<00:00:40.539> central<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.640> second<00:00:43.000> one<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.829> too<00:00:44.829> much

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
more central the second one is too much

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.450 
more central the second one is too much
movement<00:00:45.309> into<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.210> right<00:00:46.420> side<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.460> not

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
movement into the right side and not

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.000 
movement into the right side and not
being<00:00:48.670> able<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.940> then<00:00:49.750> get<00:00:50.350> everything<00:00:50.559> moving

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
being able to then get everything moving

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.010 
being able to then get everything moving
back<00:00:51.699> through<00:00:51.870> okay

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
back through okay

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.810 
back through okay
of<00:00:53.320> course<00:00:53.590> we're<00:00:53.770> looking<00:00:53.800> for<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.640> low

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
of course we're looking for the low

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.720 
of course we're looking for the low

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
point to be in the golf swing to be

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.189 
point to be in the golf swing to be
after<00:00:58.149> we've<00:00:58.239> struck<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.539> ball<00:00:58.660> we<00:00:58.899> don't

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
after we've struck the ball we don't

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.259 
after we've struck the ball we don't
want<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.410> low<00:00:59.559> point<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.489> be<00:01:00.640> before<00:01:01.090> we've

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
want the low point to be before we've

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.240 
want the low point to be before we've
hit<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.480> golf<00:01:01.660> ball<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:02.079> lot<00:01:02.590> of<00:01:02.680> people<00:01:02.949> assume

the golf ball in the air but a cane this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.940 
the golf ball in the air but a cane this

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
will allow the club just to bottom out

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.550 
will allow the club just to bottom out
before<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.340> hits<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.640> golf<00:01:09.880> ball<00:01:10.119> okay<00:01:10.560> so

that<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:16.600> transfer<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.320> weight<00:01:17.439> we<00:01:18.400> move<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
that we transfer the weight we move the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.539 
that we transfer the weight we move the
hips<00:01:18.970> through<00:01:19.689> towards<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.110> target<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:21.369> make

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
hips through towards the target to make

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.190 
hips through towards the target to make
much<00:01:21.820> more<00:01:21.850> solid<00:01:22.390> contact<00:01:22.750> with<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:22.960> golf

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
much more solid contact with that golf

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.380 
much more solid contact with that golf
ball<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:23.710> stop<00:01:24.250> us<00:01:24.400> hitting<00:01:24.640> behind<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.240> ball

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
ball and stop us hitting behind the ball

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.840 
ball and stop us hitting behind the ball
I'm<00:01:25.930> going<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.439> position<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.280> ball<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.670> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
I'm going to position the ball in the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.760 
I'm going to position the ball in the
center<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.299> stance<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:29.170> begin<00:01:29.380> with<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
center of the stance to begin with and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.319 
center of the stance to begin with and
I'm<00:01:30.220> just<00:01:30.549> going<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.850> shuffle<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.210> ball

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
I'm just going to shuffle the ball

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.020 
I'm just going to shuffle the ball
forwards<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.890> it's<00:01:33.009> just<00:01:33.340> outside<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.880> left

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
forwards so it's just outside the left

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.630 
forwards so it's just outside the left
foot<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.259> course<00:01:35.380> now<00:01:35.680> if<00:01:35.979> I'm<00:01:36.189> hitting<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
foot so of course now if I'm hitting the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.460 
foot so of course now if I'm hitting the
golf<00:01:36.759> ball<00:01:36.909> from<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:37.570> back<00:01:37.780> foot<00:01:38.020> the

golf ball from this back foot the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.050 
golf ball from this back foot the
chances<00:01:38.920> are<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.280> won't<00:01:39.610> even<00:01:39.759> make<00:01:40.030> contact

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
chances are I won't even make contact

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.660 
chances are I won't even make contact
with<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.810> golf<00:01:40.960> ball<00:01:41.200> let<00:01:41.860> alone<00:01:42.130> hitting<00:01:42.549> the
