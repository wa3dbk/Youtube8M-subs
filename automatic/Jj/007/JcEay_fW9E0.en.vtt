00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.920 
but I just couldn't take it anymore um I
felt<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.670> was<00:02:10.910> losing<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.390> hair<00:02:11.450> than<00:02:11.780> I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
felt like I was losing more hair than I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.400 
felt like I was losing more hair than I
was<00:02:12.080> growing<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.959> my<00:02:14.959> hair<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.380> really

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
was growing and my hair was really

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.570 
was growing and my hair was really
really<00:02:15.890> dry<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:17.860> having<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.950> texturizer<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
really dry but having a texturizer and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.360 
really dry but having a texturizer and
my<00:02:19.760> hair<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.000> drier<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:21.410> that's<00:02:21.799> not<00:02:22.069> even

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
my hair is drier but that's not even

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.470 
my hair is drier but that's not even
that<00:02:22.400> serious<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.209> me

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
that serious to me

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.920 
that serious to me
because<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.620> pros<00:02:25.030> completely<00:02:26.030> outweigh<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
because the pros completely outweigh the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.430 
because the pros completely outweigh the
cons<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.190> only<00:02:28.340> con<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> really<00:02:30.200> had

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
cons so the only con that I really had

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.500 
cons so the only con that I really had
for<00:02:30.799> being<00:02:31.130> texturize<00:02:31.610> now<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.269> my<00:02:32.330> hair

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
for being texturize now is that my hair

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.780 
for being texturize now is that my hair
dryer<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.170> would<00:02:34.069> have<00:02:34.160> said<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.340> had<00:02:34.580> another

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
dryer I would have said I had another

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.970 
dryer I would have said I had another
con<00:02:35.060> which<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:35.810> I'm<00:02:35.930> no<00:02:36.049> longer<00:02:36.230> natural<00:02:36.739> but<00:02:36.950> I

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
con which is I'm no longer natural but I

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.370 
con which is I'm no longer natural but I
could<00:02:37.190> really<00:02:37.430> care<00:02:37.790> less<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.110> care<00:02:39.349> that

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
could really care less I don't care that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.440 
could really care less I don't care that
I'm<00:02:39.620> not<00:02:39.769> actually<00:02:40.010> more<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.239> actually

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
I'm not actually more because I actually

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.050 
I'm not actually more because I actually
see<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.930> my<00:02:42.049> hair<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.260> growing<00:02:42.549> faster<00:02:43.549> now

I'm<00:03:15.980> sorry<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.549> be<00:03:16.760> jumbling<00:03:17.180> but

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
I'm sorry to just be jumbling but

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.599 
I'm sorry to just be jumbling but
another<00:03:18.859> Pro<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.870> my<00:03:20.870> curls<00:03:21.560> are<00:03:22.010> more

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
another Pro is that my curls are more

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.190 
another Pro is that my curls are more
even<00:03:23.269> when<00:03:23.569> I<00:03:23.600> was<00:03:23.870> natural<00:03:24.410> my<00:03:25.400> left<00:03:25.700> side<00:03:26.200> was

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
even when I was natural my left side was

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.559 
even when I was natural my left side was
more<00:03:27.230> wavy<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.980> my<00:03:28.220> right<00:03:28.730> side<00:03:29.000> was<00:03:29.030> more

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
more wavy and my right side was more

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.460 
more wavy and my right side was more
like<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.340> 3c<00:03:31.340> for<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.389> like<00:03:32.630> they<00:03:32.780> were<00:03:32.870> tight<00:03:33.170> and

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
like a 3c for a like they were tight and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.500 
like a 3c for a like they were tight and
so<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.130> cut<00:03:34.400> into<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.609> wash<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.970> go<00:03:35.030> because<00:03:35.389> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
so I cut into a wash and go because it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.539 
so I cut into a wash and go because it
would<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.720> like<00:03:35.900> I'll<00:03:36.410> be<00:03:36.560> like<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:37.430> I

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
would be like I'll be like this and I

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.059 
would be like I'll be like this and I
hated<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.690> when<00:03:38.840> i<00:03:38.870> texturize<00:03:39.319> i<00:03:39.799> made<00:03:40.040> sure

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
hated it so when i texturize i made sure

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.250 
hated it so when i texturize i made sure
that<00:03:40.459> i<00:03:40.579> did<00:03:40.790> my<00:03:40.970> right<00:03:41.150> side<00:03:41.389> first<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:41.989> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
that i did my right side first so the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.080 
that i did my right side first so the
chemicals<00:03:42.889> could<00:03:43.069> stay<00:03:43.250> on<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.519> longer<00:03:43.549> and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
chemicals could stay on it longer and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.789 
chemicals could stay on it longer and
now<00:03:44.480> my<00:03:44.690> hair<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.980> more<00:03:46.280> as<00:03:46.579> wavy<00:03:47.030> curly<00:03:47.930> but

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
now my hair is is more as wavy curly but

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.860 
now my hair is is more as wavy curly but
it's<00:03:48.950> cuter<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.090> don't<00:03:50.150> know<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.450> just<00:03:50.480> love

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
it's cuter like I don't know I just love

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.129 
it's cuter like I don't know I just love
it<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:52.030> manageability<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.450> doesn't<00:03:53.780> take<00:03:53.959> me

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
it so manageability it doesn't take me

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.550 
it so manageability it doesn't take me
that<00:03:54.889> long<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.160> do<00:03:55.430> styles<00:03:55.910> at<00:03:56.150> all

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
that long to do styles at all

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.190 
that long to do styles at all
it's<00:03:57.890> just<00:03:58.069> better<00:03:58.330> um<00:03:59.330> my<00:03:59.750> hair<00:03:59.990> obviously

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
it's just better um my hair obviously

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.880 
it's just better um my hair obviously
gets<00:04:00.770> straight<00:04:01.220> easier<00:04:01.720> um<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:03.319> doesn't<00:04:03.590> take

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
gets straight easier um it doesn't take

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.370 
gets straight easier um it doesn't take
that<00:04:04.010> long<00:04:04.069> to<00:04:04.220> blow-dry<00:04:04.520> it<00:04:05.480> doesn't<00:04:05.870> take

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
that long to blow-dry it doesn't take

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.190 
that long to blow-dry it doesn't take
that<00:04:06.410> long<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:07.190> do<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.610> comb<00:04:07.940> chase<00:04:08.330> method

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that long to do the comb chase method

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.650 
that long to do the comb chase method
and<00:04:09.530> flat<00:04:09.740> ironing<00:04:10.100> it's<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.550> much<00:04:10.760> sleeker<00:04:11.180> it

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
and flat ironing it's so much sleeker it

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.170 
and flat ironing it's so much sleeker it

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
length better um it is it could be

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.080
