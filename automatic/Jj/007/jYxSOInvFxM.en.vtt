hybrid athletes mental training and

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.000 
hybrid athletes mental training and
visualization<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.850> keys<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.210> PRS<00:00:07.049> guys<00:00:07.529> I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
visualization are the keys to PRS guys I

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.910 
visualization are the keys to PRS guys I
was<00:00:08.910> stuck<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.389> PR<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> little<00:00:10.469> over<00:00:10.679> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
was stuck at a PR for a little over a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.459 
was stuck at a PR for a little over a
year<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:12.360> started<00:00:12.809> employing<00:00:13.230> these

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
year and I started employing these

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.689 
year and I started employing these
techniques<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.400> visualization<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
techniques of visualization and

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.340 
techniques of visualization and
magically<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.880> numbers<00:00:18.300> started<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.960> increase

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
magically my numbers started to increase

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
magically my numbers started to increase
again<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> mental<00:00:23.100> training<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.970> very

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
again so mental training is very

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.609 
again so mental training is very
important<00:00:25.050> guys<00:00:25.640> you'll<00:00:26.640> hear<00:00:26.910> guys<00:00:27.119> say<00:00:27.660> I

important guys you'll hear guys say I
hit<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.490> number<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.619> training<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> do

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
hit that number and training or I do

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.479 
hit that number and training or I do
that<00:00:32.520> set<00:00:33.059> amount<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> weight<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.050> reps<00:00:34.559> but

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that set amount of weight for reps but

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
that set amount of weight for reps but
in<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.760> meet<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.899> strict

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
in a meet you know with strict

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.010 
in a meet you know with strict
guidelines<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.160> judging<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:39.540> missed<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
guidelines and judging they missed the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.610 
guidelines and judging they missed the
attempt<00:00:40.550> or<00:00:41.550> possibly<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:43.200> miss<00:00:43.410> their

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
attempt or possibly they they miss their

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
attempt or possibly they they miss their
opening<00:00:44.070> attempt<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> light<00:00:45.120> weight<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
opening attempt with a light weight and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
opening attempt with a light weight and
then<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.500> lose<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.980> mentally<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.520> can't<00:00:47.820> get

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
then they lose it mentally and can't get

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
then they lose it mentally and can't get
back<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> meat<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> miss<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> other<00:00:49.590> two

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
back in the meat and miss the other two

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.729 
back in the meat and miss the other two
attempts<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.750> stems<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.320> lack<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
attempts this all stems from lack of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
attempts this all stems from lack of
mental<00:00:53.280> training<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> avoid<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.460> guy's<00:00:56.789> each
