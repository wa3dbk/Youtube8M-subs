00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 But the students of the second city school 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 before heading to spring 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.240
 vacation to learn the basics of botany 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.210
 found an interesting idea 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.780
 the idea of ​​growing a whole noni tree from 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 sprout 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.869
 but from the branch it is not new but specialist 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.029
 Ministry of Ecology decided to refresh it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.519
 breeding like this is amenable to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 not all types of trees yet experiment 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.470
 held on the poplars 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 and his children joined him yesterday 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 learning the basics of botany mixed with 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.300
 environmental issues passed in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.190
 city ​​school number two 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 what distinguishes a dry branch from a branch 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 blooming one is dead and the second 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.579
 not allowed to die 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.070
 and several of these branches are able 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.739
 to revive the site and a few dozen 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 such branches able to revive the flora 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.329
 whole city 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.949
 you just need to help them a little at the beginning 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.140
 assistance in such an important matter lay on 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.300
 shoulders of children in the second city school 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.300
 passed the first master class in a new way 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.990
 view of planting future trees new to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.400
 them because the way for many years 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.960
 the experiment was also conducted in our 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 school biology teacher 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.200
 it was also also in primary classes 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.720
 and here are the memories of this they gave me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 his work helped in the work 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.830
 greening the city I hope will help 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.810
 further the idea is that in the absence of 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.979
 sprouts of future trees can be 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.290
 improvise 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.049
 for this, every tree is cut 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.119
 branches are planted in a tank with 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.579
 water and for several days 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.040
 aged in the sun with the onset 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.090
 process on the branch formed a small 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.560
 white growth 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 this is the future root bag 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.149
 start off 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.850
 this method of cultivation is not amenable to 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.909
 all kinds of trees until everything works out 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.450
 only with his usual poplar and poplar 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.380
 pyramidal school 2 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 never a few years ago were 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.350
 cut down poplars before school because 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.160
 they were already a threat and here they are 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.709
 will be planted here I hope for everyone 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.099
 central streets since the pyramidal 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.690
 poplar 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.600
 he is a very beautiful 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.850
 decorative tree and not representing 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.860
 such a threat the danger in a month already 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.340
 will appear from the buds Arab leaves will 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.849
 roots will appear i and he will already be and they 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.450
 we will be trees by ourselves 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.910
 when they will be planted they will be 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.310
 brothers minerals and nutrients and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.410
 land afterwards and soon after some years 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.670
 they will turn into real trees 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.560
 trees and will give us kisarov 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.650
 pupils of the second city school about the new 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 first we learned the landing method 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.650
 learning the basics of botany mixed with 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.609
 environmental issues continue for 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.760
 specialists of the Ministry of Ecology 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.920
 it is planned that ready saplings of lungs 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.420
 our planet will only benefit 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.380
 the atmosphere of the city 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.380
 most of the varieties of future trees 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.380
 hypoallergenic
