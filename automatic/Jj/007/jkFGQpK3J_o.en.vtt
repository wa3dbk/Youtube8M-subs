00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
but I think the absolute best part about

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.140 
but I think the absolute best part about
this<00:02:26.450> Armada<00:02:26.930> is<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.760> so

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
this Armada is that because it is so

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.960 
this Armada is that because it is so
large<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.170> doesn't<00:02:30.830> matter<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.250> size<00:02:31.430> person

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970
