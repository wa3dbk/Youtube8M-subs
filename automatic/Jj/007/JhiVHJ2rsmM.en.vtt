00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 and what do we explain at the beginning 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.360
 of the program are so fast that they are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.670
 the directive surprised up 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 will use the word sorry though 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 not what they have admitted that they have not 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.369
 operated the gustavo matosas the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.050
 realize that there is no chemistry with the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.640
 players but then the pro there is no 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 chemistry with the directive yes but it's the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.500
 america and you just gave him results 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 that is to say the trick when they put up with it 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.359
 a while there that communication goes well 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.949
 then another not here as far as I could 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 find out there is not good communication 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.600
 directive with Gustavo matosas with the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.170
 same players have asked you to do 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.629
 group and what to win the concachampions in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.539
 montreal is an obligation that is not 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.480
 as if then already with that of what I 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.969
 I was able to gather the information if 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.900
 brushy not get into the playoffs and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.080
 a final a bicampeonato 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.420
 is going and such dare to say that there are 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.370
 a plan b in the minds of managers 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.160
 of America for a next technician in 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.870
 the next tournament the only thing I know if 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.030
 come that decision would be someone from 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.760
 local market do not want a name 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.130
 bombastic from abroad but what 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.620
 today I was surprised to know that already in the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.270
 of the managers there is the possible 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.330
 have another technician because there is no chemistry 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.530
 you do not lose the classic america 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.050
 and then you do not beat the impact the same 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.610
 It is not like this 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.040
 what I know is that they are thinking a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.690
 change for the next tournament you get 3 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.690
 or 4 chivas if you do not win 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 sure they can not stand it one more day 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.960
 tex happen it's Wednesday they say 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.159
 great been well loses the title by fuks 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.259
 outside 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.200
 and entry entry I can assure you 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.090
 that matosas resigns if the directors 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.149
 they do not make the decisions 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.189
 one side or you have to be aware 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.399
 I'm going to face a commitment 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.009
 difficult there is a great interest but 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.799
 america the truth is that it does not have no 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.129
 has shown the impact and the solidity or 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.739
 it is very marked highs and lows and 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.930
 active front good had the opportunity 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.500
 to reach the classic by beating a 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.420
 equipment that on paper looked like or like a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.610
 procedural match face the one 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.069
 tried local rafa is a question 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.079
 after taking out of playing forgiveness a good 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.450
 match as you want to be the rival 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.090
 against herediano because there were moments 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.489
 that played by note the team a first 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.319
 time in monterrey very well played and 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.319
 then it's a shame
