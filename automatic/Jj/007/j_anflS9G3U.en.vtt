00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.520 

No

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
No

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.220 
No
Oh<00:00:40.559> No<00:00:42.410> for<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.470> fastest<00:00:44.040> man<00:00:44.280> Isaac<00:00:48.230> Newton

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
Oh No for the fastest man Isaac Newton

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
Oh No for the fastest man Isaac Newton
realized<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:50.100> Aristotle<00:00:50.699> was<00:00:50.820> wrong<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
realized that Aristotle was wrong and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
realized that Aristotle was wrong and
force<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.320> necessary<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.220> maintain

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
force was not necessary to maintain

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.180 
force was not necessary to maintain
motion<00:00:54.089> so<00:00:54.269> we<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.079> ma<00:00:55.500> equals<00:00:56.129> mg

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
motion so we can see that ma equals mg

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.479 
motion so we can see that ma equals mg
and<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:59.190> know
