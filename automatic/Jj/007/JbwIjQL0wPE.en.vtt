00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 all right 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.680
 hello everyone come to the third episode 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.750
 of the analysis of weapons of black ops 2 in 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.280
 the lvbp channel today we will see the one 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.480
 it has been the most used assault rifle 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.320
 during the first months of 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.060
 competition the fall or sw the fall is a 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.790
 assault rifle semiautomatic 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.860
 whose bullets can do between 55 and 40 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.080
 points of damage this translates into 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.140
 we will need only 2 to 3 bullets 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.900
 to eliminate an enemy the range of 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.570
 the two bullets reach 16 meters without 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.280
 However, the 20% bonus for 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.559
 shots to the head make the fall 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.379
 can kill an enemy with two bullets 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.839
 up to 58 meters as long as one 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.550
 of them hits your head 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.409
 cadence is the second lowest of the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.319
 category making this its worst 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.230
 characteristic only reaches 515 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:54.850
 bullets per minute the recoil of this 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.739
 weapon is very low practically 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.690
 non-existent is surely the rifle of 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.640
 more accurate assault however the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.739
 Precision from the hip is very bad 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.870
 rather mediocre since the cadence so 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.880
 low and a reticle somewhat larger than the 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.590
 of the rest of assault rifles make the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.450
 funk a very irregular weapon when not 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.130
 we use the aim to aim 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.159
 the recharge time is normal pulling 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.560
 down 2.0 not in seconds to place a 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.049
 new loader the pointed one the typical 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.969
 of all 0.25 assault rifles for 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.189
 put the look and 0 with 25 seconds 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.840
 also to remove the speed of 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.210
 movement is also equal to the rest of 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.100
 assault rifles 95% mobility 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 while the size of the charger is 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.630
 something lower than the usual 25 bullets 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.369
 only in summary the fall is a weapon 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.319
 very powerful with a great reach and 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.539
 depends a lot on the accuracy of 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.970
 user so it is advisable to use it 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.470
 in rather defensive functions and 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.869
 always accompanied by accessories 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.479
 unsheathed and one looks at the taste of 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.909
 player this is all you need to know 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.750
 of the fall or sw see you in the next 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.750
 goodbye episode
