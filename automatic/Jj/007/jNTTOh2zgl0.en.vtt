00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:20.440 

I<00:00:18.400> think<00:00:19.400> we<00:00:19.490> define<00:00:19.790> us<00:00:19.910> as<00:00:20.030> many<00:00:20.300> as

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
I think we define us as many as

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.230 
I think we define us as many as
sculptures<00:00:21.040> what<00:00:22.040> we<00:00:22.160> do<00:00:22.370> we<00:00:22.730> don't<00:00:22.850> see<00:00:23.090> is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
sculptures what we do we don't see is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.779 
sculptures what we do we don't see is
the<00:00:23.420> toy

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
the toy

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.409 
the toy
for<00:00:25.419> us<00:00:25.509> it's<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.869> sculpture

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.889 

I'm<00:00:32.780> mark<00:00:33.109> landsman<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.039> we<00:00:34.309> are<00:00:34.460> course<00:00:34.899> the

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
I'm mark landsman and we are course the

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.479 
I'm mark landsman and we are course the
reason<00:00:36.079> why<00:00:36.440> whenever<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:36.920> started<00:00:37.370> the

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
reason why whenever I started the

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.060 
reason why whenever I started the
project<00:00:37.670> with<00:00:38.179> us<00:00:38.359> was<00:00:39.230> because<00:00:39.800> they<00:00:39.949> wanted

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
project with us was because they wanted

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.950 
project with us was because they wanted
to<00:00:40.280> have<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> completely<00:00:40.850> new<00:00:41.030> take<00:00:41.329> on<00:00:41.510> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
to have a completely new take on the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.060 
to have a completely new take on the
collectors<00:00:42.589> figure

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.550 

for<00:00:50.579> me<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.940> fun<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.720> design<00:00:51.989> our

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
for me it was fun to design our

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.979 
for me it was fun to design our
scorpions<00:00:53.310> appearance<00:00:53.790> because<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.570> had<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
scorpions appearance because I had a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
scorpions appearance because I had a
chance<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:56.100> give<00:00:56.790> some<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.570> unique<00:00:57.720> ideas

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
chance to give some really unique ideas

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.910 
chance to give some really unique ideas
to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.860> figure<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.110> coming<00:01:01.110> up<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to the figure and coming up with the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.759 
to the figure and coming up with the
concept<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> character<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:04.379> always

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
concept for a character that was always

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.370 
concept for a character that was always
one<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.369> favorite<00:01:05.700> ones<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.660> went<00:01:07.170> early

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
one of my favorite ones we went early

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.249 
one of my favorite ones we went early
amount<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.190> time<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.790> sketching<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.990> trying

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
amount of time on sketching just trying

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.070 
amount of time on sketching just trying
to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to get the look right but then the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
to get the look right but then the
sculpting<00:01:13.500> process<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.160> actual<00:01:14.460> process

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
sculpting process is the actual process

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.810 
sculpting process is the actual process
of<00:01:15.090> creation<00:01:15.479> our<00:01:16.020> approach<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.410> more<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.400> we

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
of creation our approach is more that we

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.219 
of creation our approach is more that we
start<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> three-dimensional<00:01:19.200> object

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
start with a three-dimensional object

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
start with a three-dimensional object
when<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> three-dimensional

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
when you think with a three-dimensional

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
when you think with a three-dimensional
of<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.420> interest<00:01:22.130> we<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.399> pay<00:01:23.580> attention

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of the interest we really pay attention

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210 
of the interest we really pay attention
to<00:01:24.030> every<00:01:24.360> line<00:01:24.539> every<00:01:24.750> detail<00:01:25.649> every<00:01:25.680> shape

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to every line every detail every shape

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.279 
to every line every detail every shape
so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.690> sculpture<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
so it's really about the sculpture I

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.900 
so it's really about the sculpture I
think<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.100> most<00:01:29.340> important<00:01:29.880> part

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
think that's the most important part

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.630 
think that's the most important part
being<00:01:30.869> part<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> collector's<00:01:31.860> edition<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
being part of the collector's edition is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
being part of the collector's edition is
great<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.300> we<00:01:33.660> we<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.259> bring<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.649> same

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
great because we we can bring the same

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
great because we we can bring the same
experience<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> show<00:01:35.940> our<00:01:36.119> work<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.660> much

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
experience and show our work to a much

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:48.950 
experience and show our work to a much
larger<00:01:37.259> audience

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.160 

I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.400> our<00:01:50.820> decisions<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.720> designing

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I think all our decisions in designing

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.940 
I think all our decisions in designing
the<00:01:52.619> score<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.159> reflect<00:01:53.790> our<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
the score can reflect our way to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.940 
the score can reflect our way to
translate<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.700> broken<00:01:57.390> character<00:01:57.950> into

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
translate this broken character into

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.399 
translate this broken character into
shapes<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.729> forms<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
shapes and forms we have them that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.100 
shapes and forms we have them that
around<00:02:01.680> an<00:02:02.100> hour<00:02:02.310> spin<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.970> scorpion<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.900> going

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
around an hour spin on scorpion is going

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
around an hour spin on scorpion is going
to<00:02:04.170> find<00:02:04.409> its<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.740> back<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
to find its way back in the game the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.430 
to find its way back in the game the
cool<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.960> collector's

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
cool thing is that the collector's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.800 
cool thing is that the collector's
edition<00:02:07.950> features<00:02:08.489> our<00:02:08.789> version<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
edition features our version of the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.650 
edition features our version of the
character<00:02:09.989> physically<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.069> digitally<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:12.480> are

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
character physically in digitally we are

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.380 
character physically in digitally we are
allowed<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.170> bring<00:02:13.920> our<00:02:14.130> style<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.850> add

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
allowed to bring our style and add

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
allowed to bring our style and add
