hi<00:00:06.729> bond<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:08.230> here<00:00:08.830> we've<00:00:09.040> got<00:00:09.160> probe<00:00:09.430> on<00:00:09.639> aqua

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
hi bond is here we've got probe on aqua

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.760 
hi bond is here we've got probe on aqua
and<00:00:10.660> probe<00:00:10.959> on<00:00:11.139> cream<00:00:11.559> these<00:00:12.129> are<00:00:12.369> both<00:00:12.580> our

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
and probe on cream these are both our

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.760 
and probe on cream these are both our
acrylic<00:00:14.770> based<00:00:15.449> so<00:00:16.449> it<00:00:16.630> truly<00:00:16.900> water-based

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
acrylic based so it truly water-based

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.330 
acrylic based so it truly water-based
glues<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:19.080> probe<00:00:20.080> on<00:00:20.230> aqua<00:00:20.710> is<00:00:20.890> more<00:00:21.160> liquid

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
glues and probe on aqua is more liquid

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.170 
glues and probe on aqua is more liquid
form<00:00:21.850> and<00:00:22.270> this<00:00:23.080> is<00:00:23.260> very<00:00:23.530> similar<00:00:23.800> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
form and this is very similar to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140 
form and this is very similar to
prostate<00:00:25.180> and<00:00:26.010> he's<00:00:27.010> glued<00:00:27.280> exactly<00:00:27.850> the<00:00:27.910> same

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
prostate and he's glued exactly the same

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.790 
prostate and he's glued exactly the same
way

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
way

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.490 
way
and<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.280> probe<00:00:30.550> on<00:00:30.730> cream<00:00:31.150> is<00:00:31.539> just<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.259> thicker

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
and the probe on cream is just a thicker

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.770 
and the probe on cream is just a thicker
version<00:00:32.739> equally<00:00:33.309> as<00:00:33.399> strong<00:00:33.579> but<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.149> cream

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
version equally as strong but a cream

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.860 
version equally as strong but a cream
version<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.800> aqua<00:00:36.210> which<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.539> has<00:00:37.719> the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
version of the aqua which it has the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.590 
version of the aqua which it has the
advantage<00:00:38.319> really<00:00:38.679> of<00:00:38.769> being<00:00:39.210> doesn't<00:00:40.210> spill

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
advantage really of being doesn't spill

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.419 
advantage really of being doesn't spill
so<00:00:40.839> all<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.050> locations<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.739> quite<00:00:41.979> a<00:00:42.010> handy

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
so all the locations is quite a handy
