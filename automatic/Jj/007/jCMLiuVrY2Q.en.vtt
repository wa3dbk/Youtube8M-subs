00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
common sense or even like if you just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.499 
common sense or even like if you just
used<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.500> little<00:01:36.679> bit<00:01:36.830> of<00:01:37.160> Sony<00:01:38.000> Vegas<00:01:38.209> you

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
used a little bit of Sony Vegas you

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.130 
used a little bit of Sony Vegas you
should<00:01:38.780> understand<00:01:39.410> how<00:01:39.709> to<00:01:40.640> do<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.030> like<00:01:41.959> I

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
should understand how to do it like I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.999 
should understand how to do it like I
barely<00:01:42.729> use<00:01:43.729> Sony<00:01:44.030> Vegas<00:01:44.240> anymore<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:45.200> use<00:01:45.830> it

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
barely use Sony Vegas anymore I use it

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.279 
barely use Sony Vegas anymore I use it
like<00:01:46.220> unless<00:01:46.520> I'm<00:01:46.700> editing<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.209> video<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:48.140> has

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
like unless I'm editing a video that has

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.109 
like unless I'm editing a video that has
multiple<00:01:48.679> Clips<00:01:49.160> if<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.459> just<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:49.910> I

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
multiple Clips if it's just one I

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.150 
multiple Clips if it's just one I
usually<00:01:50.630> just<00:01:50.750> cut<00:01:51.080> each<00:01:51.289> end<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.039> and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
usually just cut each end of it and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.400 
usually just cut each end of it and
that's<00:01:52.250> all<00:01:52.459> I<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.660> because<00:01:53.660> it's<00:01:53.869> quicker<00:01:54.200> and

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's all I do because it's quicker and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.109 
that's all I do because it's quicker and
easier<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.009> don't<00:01:55.069> know<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.910> it's

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
easier and I don't know that it's

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.279 
easier and I don't know that it's
something<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.479> doesn't<00:01:56.899> need<00:01:56.959> to<00:01:57.020> be<00:01:57.140> edited

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289

music but it was supposed to be non
copyrighted<00:04:50.030> music<00:04:50.539> it's<00:04:51.020> too<00:04:51.500> close<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
copyrighted music it's too close to the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.870 
copyrighted music it's too close to the
original<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:52.669> it

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
original so it

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.080

your<00:05:15.320> thing<00:05:15.530> is<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.770> use<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:17.030> is<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.240> custom

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
your thing is I use the this is a custom

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.190 
your thing is I use the this is a custom
template<00:05:18.050> but<00:05:18.200> basically<00:05:18.560> it's<00:05:18.800> just<00:05:19.070> this<00:05:19.280> 8

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
template but basically it's just this 8

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.130 
template but basically it's just this 8
megabytes<00:05:21.200> per<00:05:21.380> second<00:05:21.890> HD<00:05:22.600> which<00:05:23.600> is<00:05:23.840> the

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
megabytes per second HD which is the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.250 
megabytes per second HD which is the
1080<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.400> believe<00:05:25.820> 720<00:05:26.510> also<00:05:26.870> at<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.110> same

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
1080 and I believe 720 also at the same

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.290 
1080 and I believe 720 also at the same
time<00:05:27.500> you<00:05:27.680> can<00:05:27.860> do<00:05:28.370> whatever<00:05:28.610> on<00:05:28.910> YouTube

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
time you can do whatever on YouTube

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.760 
time you can do whatever on YouTube
that's<00:05:29.570> what<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.080> got<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.320> use<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.650> then<00:05:30.740> you

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
that's what you got to use and then you

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.020 
that's what you got to use and then you
just<00:05:31.010> customize<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.640> to<00:05:31.700> like<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.940> high

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
just customize it to like the high

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.500 
just customize it to like the high
settings<00:05:32.450> and<00:05:32.720> then<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:33.800> render<00:05:34.100> it<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:35.090> then

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
settings and then you render it and then

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.240 
settings and then you render it and then
that's<00:05:35.810> all<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.020> got<00:05:36.170> to<00:05:36.260> do<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:36.590> when<00:05:36.980> you're

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
that's all you got to do and when you're

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.030 
that's all you got to do and when you're
done<00:05:37.430> it'll<00:05:37.990> sometimes<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.410> find<00:05:39.710> with<00:05:39.890> Sony

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.310 
done it'll sometimes I find with Sony
Vegas<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.460> it'll<00:05:40.730> have<00:05:40.880> weird<00:05:41.240> like<00:05:41.510> squares

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
Vegas that it'll have weird like squares

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.320 
Vegas that it'll have weird like squares
everywhere<00:05:42.770> so<00:05:43.640> it's<00:05:43.790> not<00:05:43.940> rendered

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
everywhere so it's not rendered

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.390 
everywhere so it's not rendered
correctly<00:05:44.540> you<00:05:45.440> can<00:05:45.560> always<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:46.010> only<00:05:46.130> tastes

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
correctly you can always it only tastes

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.400

like<00:05:46.610> five<00:05:46.880> minutes<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.300> render<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:48.320> you

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
like five minutes to render it so you

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.410 
like five minutes to render it so you
