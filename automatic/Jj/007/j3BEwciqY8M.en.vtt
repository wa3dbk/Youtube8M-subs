trying<00:06:16.229> to<00:06:16.289> figure<00:06:16.470> out<00:06:16.530> if<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.740> have<00:06:16.860> my<00:06:16.949> laser

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
trying to figure out if I have my laser

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.070 
trying to figure out if I have my laser
sight<00:06:17.490> on<00:06:17.639> or<00:06:17.880> off<00:06:18.000> and<00:06:18.270> there's<00:06:18.389> just<00:06:18.570> chubby

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
sight on or off and there's just chubby

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.690 
sight on or off and there's just chubby
guys<00:06:19.320> there's<00:06:19.560> two<00:06:19.680> to<00:06:19.770> my<00:06:19.860> left<00:06:20.070> and

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
guys there's two to my left and

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.580 
guys there's two to my left and
obviously<00:06:21.150> that<00:06:21.510> position<00:06:21.960> rewards<00:06:22.440> him

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
obviously that position rewards him

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.990 
obviously that position rewards him
because<00:06:22.860> that's<00:06:23.039> a<00:06:23.099> pretty<00:06:23.279> good<00:06:23.520> head<00:06:23.729> glitch

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
because that's a pretty good head glitch

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.629 
because that's a pretty good head glitch
there

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
there

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.209

and<00:06:25.060> let's<00:06:25.629> just<00:06:25.840> finish<00:06:26.110> off<00:06:26.469> the<00:06:26.740> air<00:06:26.949> one

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
and let's just finish off the air one

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.939 
and let's just finish off the air one
last<00:06:27.430> time<00:06:27.639> with<00:06:27.819> the<00:06:27.849> help<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.479> some<00:06:29.169> anti-air

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
last time with the help of some anti-air

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.420 
last time with the help of some anti-air
it<00:06:30.159> looks<00:06:30.460> like<00:06:30.759> I'll<00:06:31.509> take<00:06:31.780> it<00:06:32.069> it's<00:06:33.069> pretty

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
it looks like I'll take it it's pretty

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.209 
it looks like I'll take it it's pretty
cheap<00:06:33.610> but<00:06:33.789> I'll<00:06:34.180> take<00:06:34.449> it<00:06:34.509> and<00:06:34.870> back<00:06:35.650> to<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.860> we

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
cheap but I'll take it and back to a we

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.309 
cheap but I'll take it and back to a we
go<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:36.909> it's<00:06:37.029> all<00:06:37.150> about<00:06:37.180> maintaining<00:06:37.960> that

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
go so it's all about maintaining that

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.080 
go so it's all about maintaining that

you're<00:06:42.490> losing<00:06:43.210> the<00:06:43.300> burn<00:06:43.509> and<00:06:43.749> it's<00:06:44.050> quick<00:06:44.409> if

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
you're losing the burn and it's quick if

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.309 
you're losing the burn and it's quick if
they've<00:06:45.189> got<00:06:45.370> two<00:06:46.029> more<00:06:46.240> guys<00:06:46.479> than<00:06:46.539> you<00:06:46.870> right

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
because there's a slow burn than a quick

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.760 
because there's a slow burn than a quick
burn<00:06:48.999> then<00:06:49.509> they've<00:06:49.659> got<00:06:49.810> two<00:06:49.960> more<00:06:50.110> guys<00:06:50.379> and
