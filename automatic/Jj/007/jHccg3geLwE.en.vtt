00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:10.340
 Hi, people, I'm a daughter, since I'm going to 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:14.710
 start making my videos are videos 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.710
 sean win the common relieved 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.869
 was testing the sound first is that 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.300
 make videos and I never did anything else 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.050
 those are the first videos I do and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 in if they are not going to be from the game guide 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.289
 because already 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.940
 I have completed the game and it is what I 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.940
 I wanted to do from today 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:50.550
 is as big as the house hug the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.400
 guaira baylor crushes what crushes 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 good good good this is perhaps a 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.630
 project that I set to get the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.630
 while watching it evolve it degrades and 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.960
 or kill the last of each one with the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.909
 wild those you have to study level 41 that 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.159
 these missions are how are accounts 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.110
 none the evolutions possibly goes 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.159
 with you the project to go 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.640
 evolving the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.979
 two or three per videos or if I can more than 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.969
 easy I will not evolve each one 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:29.450
 and I want them to put me down on 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.929
 comments that if some little you 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.049
 lack to you where to get it from what 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.609
 way already also small usa to where 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.609
 get it in what way 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.370
 is how to evolve the media and not 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.710
 evolve because they do not give 12 and look 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:55.020
 the pokemon site says there is and put 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.130
 I have 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.599
 It was the gift and I already have to communicate 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.230
 I do not like to use it, it 's very easy to use it 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.170
 but he does not even feel that it's good for me 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.819
 I use my he for me the best of all 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.370

 just a click stays as everyone will 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.170
 know that if they were a game they have to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.250
 have its highs and is that the tuna of 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.519
 capture it because I have a beautiful pretty 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.829
 panista and will facilitate that I only live 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.260
 these more difficult challenges also 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.260
 as of contract groups and writes 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.780
 and I'm looking for a little more 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.239
 I want to ask 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.050
 is what I want to ask the strong 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.120
 how did you come up with this idea of ​​putting 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.030
 this is because it is worth knowing look 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.629
 but I do not know what was your idea of long are 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.750
 it's cool input content was in 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:36.280
 box 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 the two 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.270
 good 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.819
 well I do not find so you have to go 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.140
 to the boxes 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.350
 subscribed to be seen 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.100
 walking because he called them 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.100
 cute 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.500
 It is one of the most beautiful 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.720
 it is a state that is green 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.930
 we go with flight is not that the city 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.490
 polar because the center is like 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.750
 that the blacks require 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.730
 good to have been thumb come 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.910
 always to the center of humor and I have 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.940
 poor centers and now we have already 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.100
 this I know ask a doing the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.570
 idea is very good idea the only color 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.450
 but to some friends 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.130
 the blue other reds good too we 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.430
 you see as if his drawing that after 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.430
 colour 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:43.650
 data and have with the the yellow 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.740
 to search now you are postini green rome 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.120
 goal for us like before so I'm going 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.240
 to do 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.600
 I'm going to make the idea of ​​evolving 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.400
 two parts per bit by video type or 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.940
 on the other hand we do not make this other is so 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.669
 delicate but there are and there is no 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.070
 level 40 is made in this game to santis 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.350
 and social 40 settlements in the league 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.680
 and I know that you are going to bore him 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.990
 up so possibly start the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.690
 video just when a bit is two 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.370
 evolve or one levels so 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.560
 leave ideal if you want to see with this 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.520
 evolution see the entire route of the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.289
 evolution or see just two levels before 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.960
 and tell me look at this common and say 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.930
 any introduction and first and foremost 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.190
 that case the portable hit a man that 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.880
 while the others have to look at the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.880
 that I have to camps 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.910
 Y 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.950
 2 what I'm going to do another video if it's 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.380
 What I can do is capture 2 of jumilla 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.960
 mounts and is that being in this game 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.870
 If I do not know, but I'm going to get the idea 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.660
 completion of the list so I'm going to 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.850
 to see if they are because I want them 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.390
 racing in the feed capitulate us 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.430
 we are interested they receive behaviors they are bugs 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.960
 good but I never like me 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.070
 interest the failure so I do not 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.790
 they are interested in this game 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:17.760
 20 the box 2 already 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:23.810
 ok this future of the video that 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.810
 he gets mad at stevens I like him 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:31.699
 because the whole plant cites 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.699
 and people see us next
