just wanted to add another layer of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
just wanted to add another layer of
complexity<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.690> it<00:01:07.110> data<00:01:07.500> generation<00:01:07.980> because

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
complexity to it data generation because

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400 
complexity to it data generation because
that's<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.850> didn't<00:01:09.330> write<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.230> her
