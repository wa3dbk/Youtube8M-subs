00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.870 
so this is my review on the Tarte
Amazonian<00:00:11.670> clay<00:00:12.300> BB<00:00:12.870> tinted<00:00:13.200> moisturizer<00:00:16.880> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
Amazonian clay BB tinted moisturizer and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.170 
Amazonian clay BB tinted moisturizer and
I<00:00:17.970> got<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> color<00:00:18.390> tan<00:00:18.930> um<00:00:19.880> but<00:00:20.880> we'll<00:00:21.060> talk

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I got the color tan um but we'll talk

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.820 
I got the color tan um but we'll talk
about<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> color<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.230> bit<00:00:22.380> this

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
about the color in a little bit this

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.050 
about the color in a little bit this
claims<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> light<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> medium<00:00:23.939> coverage

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
claims to be a light to medium coverage

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.960 
claims to be a light to medium coverage
so<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.720> can't<00:00:25.140> expect<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.670> full

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
so you can't expect to get a full

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
so you can't expect to get a full
coverage<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> foundation<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.230> give

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
coverage like a foundation would give

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.200 
coverage like a foundation would give
you<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.689> $36<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.380> has<00:00:31.890> 1.7<00:00:32.579> fluid

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you this is $36 and it has 1.7 fluid

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.840 
you this is $36 and it has 1.7 fluid
ounces<00:00:33.770> anyway<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.950> picked<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.550> when<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ounces anyway I picked this up when I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.020 
ounces anyway I picked this up when I
went<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> Ulta<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.350> other<00:00:37.469> day<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> did<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.309> haul

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
went to Ulta the other day I did a haul

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.440 
went to Ulta the other day I did a haul
uh<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.399> been<00:00:41.640> probably<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.969> while<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
uh so it's been probably a while I think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930

I've<00:02:31.590> already<00:02:31.740> had<00:02:32.040> some<00:02:32.070> from<00:02:32.880> sun<00:02:33.240> exposure

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
I've already had some from sun exposure

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.680 
I've already had some from sun exposure
as<00:02:33.900> well<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> got<00:02:36.150> pregnant<00:02:36.360> I

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
as well but when I got pregnant I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.860 
as well but when I got pregnant I
noticed<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.560> got<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> few<00:02:38.250> more<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.270> this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
noticed that I got a few more so this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.390 
noticed that I got a few more so this
covers<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.920> bit<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.280> not

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
covers them a little bit but not

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 
covers them a little bit but not
completely<00:02:41.850> which<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.300> OK<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.960> mean<00:02:43.110> it's

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
completely which is OK like I mean it's

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.300 
completely which is OK like I mean it's
not<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.920> bad

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
not that bad

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.980 
not that bad
so<00:02:44.730> because<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.420> picked<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.690> matched

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
so because of that I picked up matched

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.170 
so because of that I picked up matched
me<00:02:46.170> perfectly<00:02:46.590> um<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.550> have<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.820> lot<00:02:48.090> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
me perfectly um I do have a lot of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.250 
me perfectly um I do have a lot of
yellow<00:02:48.540> undertones<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:51.420> color<00:02:51.750> was

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
yellow undertones so this color was

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:19.020 
yellow undertones so this color was
definitely<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.880> best<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.360> my<00:02:54.480> skintone
