way too quick ok now I think it should
be<00:00:31.109> based<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:32.899> shore<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.079> her<00:00:34.230> slice<00:00:34.710> win<00:00:34.890> them

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
be based on shore on her slice win them

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
be based on shore on her slice win them
at<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.270> based<00:00:36.480> essentially<00:00:37.050> on

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
at all it should be based essentially on

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
at all it should be based essentially on
how<00:00:37.890> many<00:00:37.950> people<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> match<00:00:39.270> now
