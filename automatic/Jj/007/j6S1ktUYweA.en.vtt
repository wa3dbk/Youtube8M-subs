00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
on this old door one of the issues that

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.920 
on this old door one of the issues that
had<00:00:04.830> was<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.670> leading<00:00:05.940> edge<00:00:06.150> here<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
had was the leading edge here of the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.070 
had was the leading edge here of the
door<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.890> really<00:00:08.160> beat<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.370> from<00:00:09.360> 70<00:00:09.750> years<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
door was really beat up from 70 years of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
door was really beat up from 70 years of
use<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.559> know<00:00:10.679> people<00:00:11.040> moving<00:00:11.309> furniture<00:00:11.519> in

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
use you know people moving furniture in

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.089 
use you know people moving furniture in
and<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.469> banging<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.590> dinging<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.950> up

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
and out and banging and dinging it up

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
and out and banging and dinging it up
and<00:00:14.370> saying<00:00:15.150> what's<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.630> that's<00:00:16.560> where<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and saying what's here that's where I

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.240 
and saying what's here that's where I
used<00:00:17.390> some<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> body<00:00:18.750> filler<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:20.070> take

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
used some of the body filler at to take

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820 
used some of the body filler at to take
care<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.439> there<00:00:22.439> was<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.710> much

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
care of that but there was so much

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.560 
care of that but there was so much
damage<00:00:23.160> along<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.850> leading<00:00:24.119> edge<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
damage along this leading edge of the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
damage along this leading edge of the
door<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> good<00:00:25.859> crisp<00:00:26.220> square<00:00:26.640> edge

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
door and it was a good crisp square edge

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
door and it was a good crisp square edge
and<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.830> figured<00:00:29.130> being<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.490> age<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and I figured being the age that it is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.840 
and I figured being the age that it is
it<00:00:30.420> wouldn't<00:00:30.599> hurt<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.109> add<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.279> contour<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it wouldn't hurt to add some contour to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.000 
it wouldn't hurt to add some contour to
it<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> did<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.649> took<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it so what I did was I just took a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010 
it so what I did was I just took a
standard<00:00:35.430> router<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.329> used<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.660> quarter

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
standard router and I used this quarter

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.100 
standard router and I used this quarter
inch<00:00:37.200> cord<00:00:37.649> around<00:00:37.739> bit<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:39.600> chucked<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
inch cord around bit and I chucked it in

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.680 
inch cord around bit and I chucked it in
the<00:00:40.260> router<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> ran<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> edge<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the router and ran it down the edge of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.790 
the router and ran it down the edge of
that<00:00:42.840> door<00:00:43.219> to<00:00:44.219> give<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> nice<00:00:44.840> uniform<00:00:45.840> cord

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that door to give it a nice uniform cord

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.970 
that door to give it a nice uniform cord
around<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.980> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
around all the way down it and that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.360 
around all the way down it and that
eliminated<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> ugly<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.050> also

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
eliminated a lot of the ugly but it also

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.000 
eliminated a lot of the ugly but it also
eliminated<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.899> future<00:00:55.170> chances<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
eliminated you know future chances of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
eliminated you know future chances of
that<00:00:56.789> crisp<00:00:57.120> edge<00:00:57.329> being<00:00:57.930> knocked<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.410> by

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that crisp edge being knocked down by

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
that crisp edge being knocked down by
things<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.879> being<00:01:00.059> moved<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> out

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
things that are being moved in and out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
things that are being moved in and out
of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> door<00:01:00.989> same<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> along<00:01:02.550> the

of the door same with this along the
hinge<00:01:02.879> edge<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.570> went<00:01:03.840> ahead<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.049> did

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
hinge edge here I went ahead and did

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
hinge edge here I went ahead and did
this<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> would<00:01:05.489> match<00:01:05.720> comes

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this one up so that it would match comes

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
this one up so that it would match comes

this<00:01:27.330> piece<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> sandpaper<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
this piece of sandpaper like so this is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
this piece of sandpaper like so this is
220<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> start<00:01:31.920> off

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
with a grit more like 100 grit is that's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.749 
with a grit more like 100 grit is that's
going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> remove<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.920> material<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
going to remove more material for you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it on that leading edge just like that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.330 
it on that leading edge just like that
and<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> use<00:01:42.780> both<00:01:43.079> hands<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:46.340> can

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and if you use both hands you can

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.910 
and if you use both hands you can
actually<00:01:47.990> flip<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> around<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> corner<00:01:49.770> like

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
actually flip it around the corner like

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.440 
actually flip it around the corner like
that<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.549> hand<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.149> edge<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that with one hand on one edge of
