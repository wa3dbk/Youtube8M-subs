00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 4000 million years ago is 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 they questioned how life came about and how 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.170
 from lifeless beings life 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.170
 turned into something so complex 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 how the earth starts my name is 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 alexander rba steers or paris 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.130
 I am a biologist and biochemist of origin 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.640
 Soviet 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.710
 in 1921 present the botanical society 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.140
 we see that a work that concluded that 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.050
 the first organic compounds are 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 Biotic had trained mind over 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 land 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 before there were living beings 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.110
 and that these had been formed from 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.370
 of organic substances 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.850
 in 1924 oparin presented a book 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.699
 entitled the origin of life 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.039
 in Russian where he developed his 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.000
 Materialistic hypothesis about the origin 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.210
 of life in this work suggested that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.430
 newly formed the earth there was no 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.100
 organism on it and that the atmosphere 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 It was very different from the current one 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.909
 according to or paris this atmosphere 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.539
 primitive did not contain free oxygen but 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.049
 that he had compounds like methane and 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.880
 ammonia posts reacting to each other 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.060
 thanks to the energy of the radiation 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.280
 solar the electrical activity of the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.100
 atmosphere and heat sources such as 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.530
 volcanoes had resulted in the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.619
 formation of organic compounds 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.250
 high molecular weight that when dissolved in 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.069
 the primitive oceans gave rise to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.979
 first living beings or stop too 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.040
 He said there was no difference 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.070
 between life 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.620
 and death everything was characteristic of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.550
 a process of evolution of matter 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.520
 Four years later an English biologist 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.490
 John Halder would publish a short article 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 entitled the origin of life in which 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.150
 would propose an alternative similar to the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
 oparin's hypothesis he said that he 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.410
 had formed a lot of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.440
 organic compounds among which 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.140
 they were sugars and amino acids that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.480
 would form proteins and that these 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.020
 organic compounds would accumulate in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.020
 the seas
