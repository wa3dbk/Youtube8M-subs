this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> mount

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
angle there which goes that just goes

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.190 
angle there which goes that just goes
into<00:01:45.380> my<00:01:47.659> my<00:01:48.659> Evans<00:01:49.110> um<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.110> I've

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200

into my my Evans um so that's what I've
got<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.590> never<00:01:56.009> be

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
got there and then if I just never be

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.310 
got there and then if I just never be
it<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.910> can<00:01:57.120> say<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.420> Reds<00:01:57.660> are<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.140> there
