he stopped wanted to show in his
ingenuity<00:01:23.359> and<00:01:23.719> he<00:01:24.020> made<00:01:24.530> all<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:25.100> dishes

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
ingenuity and he made all of the dishes

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.330 
ingenuity and he made all of the dishes
in<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.149> banquet<00:01:26.420> from<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.560> same<00:01:27.799> basic

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
in the banquet from the same basic

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.789 
in the banquet from the same basic
ingredients<00:01:28.909> in<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:30.049> case<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.380> was<00:01:30.469> tongue

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
ingredients in this case it was tongue

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.880 
ingredients in this case it was tongue
and<00:01:31.959> I<00:01:33.579> get<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.610> guess<00:01:34.819> this<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.209> the<00:01:35.390> idea<00:01:35.719> that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
and I get I guess this is the idea that

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.669 
and I get I guess this is the idea that
alcohol<00:01:36.890> usually<00:01:37.069> how<00:01:38.859> incredibly<00:01:39.859> varied
