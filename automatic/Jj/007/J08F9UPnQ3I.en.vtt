for Jack yes I live off of cereal that's
it<00:00:25.340> mini<00:00:26.340> me<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.619> scrambler<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.740> generate<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it mini me I scrambler you generate the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.500 
it mini me I scrambler you generate the
scramble<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.760> know<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.090> once<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.420> not

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
scramble I know it's like once or not

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.560 
scramble I know it's like once or not
would<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.289> regenerate<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> kids<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.300> cool<00:00:33.540> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
would you regenerate it kids it's cool I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.950 
would you regenerate it kids it's cool I
guess<00:00:34.910> where<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.210> generated<00:00:36.840> or<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
guess where do we generated or so if it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.530 
guess where do we generated or so if it
if<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.730> if<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.910> had<00:00:42.059> messed<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
if it is like if I had messed up the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.650 
if it is like if I had messed up the
scramble<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> redo<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:44.570> what<00:00:45.570> do

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
scramble we would had to redo it what do

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450 
scramble we would had to redo it what do
mean<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.469> had<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.860> yeah<00:00:47.100> I've<00:00:47.219> done<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
mean if I had like yeah I've done the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.979 
mean if I had like yeah I've done the
scramble<00:00:47.789> ready<00:00:47.910> wouldn't<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> redo<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.830 

I'm<00:00:51.989> sure<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.710> sometimes<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.059> happened

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
I'm sure like sometimes that it happened

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.130 
I'm sure like sometimes that it happened
many<00:00:54.930> people<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.350> catch<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.760> yeah<00:00:57.140> rejected

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
many people don't catch it yeah rejected

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.729 
many people don't catch it yeah rejected
and<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> Hubble<00:00:59.489> records<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.059> broken

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
and is the Hubble records get broken

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
and is the Hubble records get broken
could<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.640> say<00:01:02.879> anyway<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.420> hopefully<00:01:03.899> not

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

this<00:01:25.850> one<00:01:26.060> or<00:01:26.090> generates<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> scramble<00:01:27.230> he's

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
this one or generates the scramble he's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.860 
this one or generates the scramble he's
off<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:27.950> 25<00:01:28.430> moves<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.390> ends<00:01:29.750> up

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
off the 25 moves this but it ends up

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
off the 25 moves this but it ends up
being<00:01:29.900> one<00:01:30.200> torn<00:01:30.410> off<00:01:30.500> oh<00:01:30.620> you<00:01:31.190> would<00:01:31.310> have<00:01:31.460> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
being one torn off oh you would have to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.560 
being one torn off oh you would have to
yeah<00:01:33.890> sure<00:01:34.130> speed<00:01:34.550> something<00:01:37.060> yeah<00:01:38.060> right

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
yeah sure speed something yeah right

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.450 
yeah sure speed something yeah right
what<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.470> mean<00:01:39.650> there<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:39.920> what<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.250> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
what I mean there is what if it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.220 
what I mean there is what if it
generates<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.940> scramble<00:01:41.360> that's<00:01:41.870> one<00:01:42.050> turn

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
generates a scramble that's one turn

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.500 
generates a scramble that's one turn
away<00:01:42.320> for<00:01:42.500> being<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.460> more<00:01:43.760> for<00:01:44.060> example

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
away for being so it's more for example

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.150 
away for being so it's more for example
once<00:01:44.660> you're<00:01:44.870> just<00:01:45.440> like<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:45.740> for

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
something like that look I thought for

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.880 
something like that look I thought for
like<00:01:47.960> 2<00:01:48.830> x<00:01:48.979> 23<00:01:49.640> /<00:01:49.760> hey<00:01:49.910> hey<00:01:53.620> okay<00:01:54.620> you're

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
like 2 x 23 / hey hey okay you're

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.580 
like 2 x 23 / hey hey okay you're
starting<00:01:55.130> guys<00:01:55.280> guys<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:56.150> don't<00:01:56.390> think<00:01:56.630> I'll

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
starting guys guys I don't think I'll

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.130

10<00:02:06.140> 2010<00:02:06.830> 05<00:02:07.479> but<00:02:08.479> he<00:02:08.570> gives<00:02:08.780> no<00:02:08.840> chance<00:02:09.229> out<00:02:09.380> of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
10 2010 05 but he gives no chance out of
