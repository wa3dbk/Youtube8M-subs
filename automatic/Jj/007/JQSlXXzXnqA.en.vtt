00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.619
 tutorial on how to use it see media and how 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.900
 connect it as you are watching and use it 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.730
 to record on the computer that then 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.960
 change in the camera to the computer to 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.940
 show you anything goes just we take 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.970
 the hdmi to connect it on computers 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.720
 not to connect it to the console or anything 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.140
 that 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.970
 we take the hdmi and here we put it I do not know 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.340
 yes it will look 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.070
 well I do not know if it rains but we put it in 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.410
 go and then plug it in where you have 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.140
 our computer the hdmi clock 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.800
 then with a cable that no longer removes and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.570
 which is this way of usb and a normal input 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.229
 like to charge the phone or the weird thing 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.780
 we place it in the only place where there 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.090
 and then in the usb and of course you have to have 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.090
 this in pc's worth 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.680
 well I say it here as we open the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.630
 program because this has software 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.840
 on the computer to record and all that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 we can give the thing here and it 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.200
 opens us automatically on the computer 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.350
 or we can click on what is this here 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 ok be here good now I'm going to change 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.020
 the computer 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.909
 to record it better so now I do not 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.060
 again I'm recording with the singing 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.100
 so you can see it just simply 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.000
 we execute this software that you have to 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.780
 go to the website that will come to you already in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 box 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.080
 you obviously give it to him and I write 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.780
 night 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.299
 finish 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.119
 It's worth once here to do it anymore 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.680
 simple you give him the catch notes come 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.530

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.700
 all 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.190
 the hdmi audio function also for 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.050
 record what is the computer or the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.130
 sounds that are on the computer and then 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.960
 the microphone if you want to record the voice 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.480
 these are still in mp3 you choose in a 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.770
 microphone and always on you have to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 always be on so that they 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.320
 serious voucher 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.420
 fuck in mp4 video configurations 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:48.310
 that is collapsed video I prefer mp4 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.260
 resolution the maximum 1440 x 900 me only 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.520
 lets me this offers people there's another 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.260
 people that you let us live 360 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.610
 megabytes per second 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 audio bit 3 256 kilobytes and speed 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.050
 of image 30 fps youtube because youtube 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.890
 whether you want it or not, it does not support you anymore gps 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.170
 Well that's how it looks better 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.610
 capturing the computer and then this if 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.030
 you want to program this cross now 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.380
 ok and then for that answer that 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.140
 you have made all the changes that 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.790
 You want to save because I or 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.430
 be I do not have to keep anything that already 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.349
 I have this already 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.599
 as you see this would be another profile that 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.200
 it would be one that I already did 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.620
 quite and this is the default save and 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.620
 all that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.430
 what to do to record 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.810
 then you have to do to record it 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.700
 you give here to ready or you just give 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.790
 in the middle button of the capturing 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.300
 I will not give it because if not, if not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.760
 It will be quite uncomfortable for 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.950
 edit where where you keep the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.319
 videos and all that good that's saved 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.489
 here as you see I already have a video here 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:14.300
 recorded I do not know I do not know what it is and if you 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.299
 Save the sound and video separately 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.180
 then it goes in our approach this editor 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.720
 and all that here is the video and the sound 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.720
 of the game 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.610

 but for the Greek director or something like that 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.680

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.289

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.910
 climb now goes up the very heavy channel 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.400
 and I've seen that the video the league of 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.470
 legends you liked it a lot 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.320
 and that seems pretty pretty good to me 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.320
 I'm seeing a little more activity in 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.550
 the channel that I do not like that 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.460
 encourages me to continue 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:56.009
 and he has sent me private messages 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:58.800
 saying if I had barnes and I do not know what 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.770

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.220
 a month ago or so I was offered a 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.220
 partner 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.980

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.960
 but I do not want partners I do not for now 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.639
 I want to partner only a hobby I like 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.630

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.120
 many times for youtube but I do not take out 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.860
 nothing with this is I like to upload videos 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.080

 I went up on Thursday I think and it's supposed to 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.060
 I was carrying the dynamic of climbing two 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:41.830
 videos or a video every two days but 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:46.060
 right now I do not feel like it so I do not 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:48.810
 as you can see this is the premium 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.810
 that's it 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:57.210
 he thinks it's speed so soon 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.380
