early like level 2 level 3 and that just

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.580 
early like level 2 level 3 and that just
kind<00:00:23.700> of<00:00:23.760> snowballed<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.900> played<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:25.410> lanes

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
kind of snowballed we played the lanes

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.890 
kind of snowballed we played the lanes
pretty<00:00:26.160> much<00:00:26.280> incorrectly<00:00:26.700> for<00:00:27.510> both<00:00:27.630> games

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
pretty much incorrectly for both games

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.980 
pretty much incorrectly for both games
and<00:00:28.310> just<00:00:29.310> felt<00:00:29.550> too<00:00:29.610> far<00:00:29.850> behind<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and just felt too far behind and you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.010 
and just felt too far behind and you
know<00:00:31.290> wasn't<00:00:31.620> able<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:31.980> make<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.309> deficit

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020

really<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.500> strong<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.280> occurred

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
really really strong what what occurred

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
really really strong what what occurred
uh<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.890> terms<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> practice<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.670> didn't

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
uh well in terms of practice we didn't

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.090 
uh well in terms of practice we didn't
get<00:01:20.969> very<00:01:21.060> much<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.350> winter

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
get very much and you know with winter

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.940 
get very much and you know with winter
break<00:01:23.340> coming<00:01:23.939> around<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.770> town

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
break coming around I was out of town

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
break coming around I was out of town
personally<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.579> mean<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.850> had<00:01:26.969> access<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
personally so I mean I had access to a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.480 
personally so I mean I had access to a
computer<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.049> maybe<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.039> a<00:01:29.070> desktop

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
computer but maybe not like a desktop

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
computer but maybe not like a desktop
like<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.630> West<00:01:30.780> rice<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.140> gone

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
like I would I think West rice was gone

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.599 
like I would I think West rice was gone
for<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.560> weeks<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.189> didn't<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.399> access

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
for two weeks so he didn't have access

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.789 
for two weeks so he didn't have access
to<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.969> good<00:01:33.119> computer<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.680> terms

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to a good computer so you know in terms

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.139 
to a good computer so you know in terms

challenger circuit money I think
personally<00:01:59.820> for<00:01:59.999> me<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.450> MLG<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.049> IPL<00:02:01.380> would

be<00:02:01.859> probably<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.549> appropriate<00:02:02.609> because<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
be probably more appropriate because I

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.819 
be probably more appropriate because I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
really outlined you know maybe that's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.440 
really outlined you know maybe that's
something<00:02:33.250> when<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.850> know<00:02:33.940> we<00:02:34.060> formed<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.390> a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
something when you know we formed as a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.580 
something when you know we formed as a
team<00:02:34.600> we<00:02:34.720> should<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.930> talked<00:02:35.140> about<00:02:35.350> more

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
but I thought it was something that you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.640 
but I thought it was something that you
know<00:02:37.600> we<00:02:37.750> were<00:02:37.840> going<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.050> be<00:02:38.170> doing<00:02:38.290> more<00:02:38.470> long

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
know we were going to be doing more long

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.220 
know we were going to be doing more long
term<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.010> maybe<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.880> some<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.870> other<00:02:40.960> team

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
term but maybe for some the other team

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.840 
term but maybe for some the other team
member<00:02:41.530> members<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.550> know<00:02:42.580> they<00:02:42.760> were

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
member members you know they were

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.430 
member members you know they were
thinking<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:43.540> season<00:02:43.960> three<00:02:44.140> or<00:02:44.230> bust

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
thinking of it as season three or bust

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.820 
thinking of it as season three or bust
so<00:02:45.750> looking<00:02:46.750> at<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.990> teams<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.320> your<00:02:47.440> group<00:02:47.650> or

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.580 
tournament and get into the championship
series<00:02:57.700> yeah<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.690> was<00:02:58.990> talking<00:02:59.320> with<00:02:59.350> some<00:02:59.560> of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
series yeah I was talking with some of

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.730 
series yeah I was talking with some of
the<00:02:59.680> other<00:02:59.710> players<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:01.480> think<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
the other players and I think that the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.430 
the other players and I think that the
brackets<00:03:03.190> are<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.940> winners<00:03:04.210> of<00:03:04.240> Group<00:03:04.990> B<00:03:05.020> are

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
brackets are the winners of Group B are

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.470 
brackets are the winners of Group B are
going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.830> are<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.580> two<00:03:07.030> teams<00:03:07.240> from<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
going to are the two teams from the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.760 
going to are the two teams from the
group<00:03:07.600> people<00:03:07.780> place<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.290> two<00:03:08.500> teams<00:03:08.650> in

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
group people place the two teams in

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.860 
group people place the two teams in
Group<00:03:08.950> C<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.300> consensus<00:03:10.600> is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
Group C and I think the consensus is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.510 
Group C and I think the consensus is
that<00:03:11.170> group<00:03:11.530> c<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.770> probably<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.130> weakest<00:03:12.400> of

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
that group c is probably the weakest of

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.450 
that group c is probably the weakest of
the<00:03:12.580> four<00:03:12.640> groups<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.210> I<00:03:13.450> definitely<00:03:14.110> see<00:03:14.380> a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
the four groups and I I definitely see a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.020 
the four groups and I I definitely see a
fear<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:16.140> GG<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.290> making<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.370> onto<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.730> extra
