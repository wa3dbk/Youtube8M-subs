00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.620
 I am your shadow mediatice is registered 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.049
 if you have never tried a salad 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.449
 of cucumber will be surprised how delicious 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.760
 that this can be today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.420
 how to make a quick cucumber salad 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.189
 and delicious with a few ingredients 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 this cucumber salad does not only know 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.990
 well but also practically does not have 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.300
 calories and it stays well crispy 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.610
 for a few days in the refrigerator if 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.280
 you do not eat it all the first day so 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 I show you how to do what I'm going to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.989
 to do is take four fresh cucumbers 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 great I'm using cucumber type 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.969
 common if you want you can use the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.530
 cabbage variety these are smaller and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.719
 usually do not require you to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.640
 fight because the shells are a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.160
 little thin but mine I'm going to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.469
 peel so to start cutting the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.589
 end of my cucumber and instead of 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.570
 peel it peel it in small strips and the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.730
 reason is that the shell has a bit of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.860
 Also, the salad is more 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.830
 attractive the next thing I'll do is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.610
 slice the cucumber into thin slices there 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.610
 some options 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.220
 you can do it with a knife if you 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.350
 you want but this may be a bit 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.380
 tedious since we want it in slices 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.300
 really thin for this you can use 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.490
 a four-sided grater that has in 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.600
 house which has one of the sides 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 ready to slice 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.880
 then I put it here in the container 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.799
 and I'm going to start slicing the cucumbers and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.540
 if we look we will see that I am 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.150
 making the slices thin and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.080
 nice to keep peeling and cutting my 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.080
 four cucumbers 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 well I have the cucumbers slice 2 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.680
 then we will add some 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.329
 vegetables and herbs the most important thing is 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 remember that you are going to add others 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.740
 vegetables in your cucumber salad 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.920
 these should slice as thin as 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.690
 the cucumbers will have the same texture 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.110
 what I am going to add is just some 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.910
 red onions into thin slices me 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.530
 like the combination of red onion 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 and the cucumber is very pretty 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.799
 and for the herb I'll use the cilantro and 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.120
 the next thing we will do is put 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.459
 dressing in the salad 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.549
 and this is very easy because the dressing does not 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.290
 need not express in advance 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.860
 simply put the ingredients 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.130
 over and mix everything 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 since my dressing goes in the refrigerator 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.310
 It has four basic ingredients 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 I'm going to use something acid, something sweet 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.769
 something salty and something a bit spicy 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.439
 is one of the reasons why this 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.890
 salad is so rich since they stimulate the 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:01.470
 palate thanks to all these flavors 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.120
 so use the lemon juice for the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.670
 acid flavor 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.709
 and by the way if you want to see this recipe 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.440
 complete go to artest cover 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.010
 dotcom administration where 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.680
 we will publish the quantities 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.989
 now I will add the sweet flavor adding 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.600
 agave syrup for the salty taste 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.760
 I will use salt from the normal table 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.070
 and for the spicy I'll put some 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.410
 red pepper flakes these are some 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.830
 few flakes of dried red pepper 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.690
 I can use a lot as little as I want just 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.360
 let me warn you that they are a little 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.940
 spicy so I'll use it with caution 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.910
 if you like spicy food you can 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.500
 add a little more and that's all 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.510
 only thing that I will do now is to mix it 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.400
 gently just so the flavors will 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.620
 mix before putting the salad in the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.360
 refrigerator and what you will notice is that 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.700
 after having been in the refrigerator 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.800
 for 30 minutes the flavors will have 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.350
 and will also mixed some 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.310
 liquid which will make it easier to mix 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.310
 before serving 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.930
 so I'm going to cover my salad 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.510
 cucumber and I'll put it in the refrigerator 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.190
 for at least 30 minutes if 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.770
 leave for a longer time not 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.600
 matter and this will allow the flavors 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.100
 mix and you will see that the cucumbers 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.100
 they release a little liquid 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.780
 this is the salad I made 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.190
 previously if you take a look you will notice 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.190
 that there is a little liquid in the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.260
 container and the cucumbers are still 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.600
 crispy although they have put a little 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.820
 soft and everyone has mixed very well 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.860
 the cucumbers are crispy and 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.830
 they will remain in the refrigerator for 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.660
 several days which is excellent there 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.760
 many variations that can be done 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.700
 remember that I only had four 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.550
 ingredients had something acid something sweet 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.340
 something salty and something spicy for the flavor 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.110
 acid use lemon juice but you can 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.750
 use lemon juice vinegar rice 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.300
 white vinegar tarragon vinegar 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.000
 Normal distillate can even be 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.100
 use balsamic vinegar is fine already 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.690
 that the taste is very good although its 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.450
 cucumber salad will have a color 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.330
 brown the next component is the 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.940
 sweet ingredient I use agave syrup 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.910
 but you can use white sugar or 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.910
 brown sugar you can use syrup 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.310
 of maple or if you do not want to use sugar you can 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.680
 use sweetener without sugar 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.110
 third component that he used was salt 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.300
 of regular table but if you feel a 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.700
 little adventurous can use soy sauce 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.790
 or you can even use a little salt of 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.890
 fish which is salty and very common in 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.689
 Thai cuisine gives it a flavor 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.080
 delicious cucumber 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.639
 Lastly I used the spicy flavor 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.069
 just use some pepper flakes 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.199
 red that are spicy but can also 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.110
 use white pepper black pepper 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.269
 ground or if you like it very spicy you can 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.610
 use a bit of cayenne pepper or 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:05.249
 even a little hot sauce like the 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.589
 tabasco the other variant is what is 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.929
 used together with the cucumber 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.119
 I added some red onions 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:14.639
 Slices can also be added 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:16.919
 grated carrots which look 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.800
 cute on the salad or you can add 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.800
 red or yellow pepper chili and remain 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.899
 delicious and finally as grass use 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.539
 cilantro although the pickles and the 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.249
 cucumber form a natural couple another 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.619
 grass that looks great with this 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.569
 saucer is the parsley now that has 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.199
 prepared the salad that will do with 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.149
 she 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.249
 well in our house we use it as 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:40.259
 accompaniment another thing that I like 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.989
 to do with it is to take a spoonful 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.460
 great to put it in my grain salad 

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:46.770
 and mix them 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.350
 I do not even need to use a dressing 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.569
 additional since it gives a lot of flavor to 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.789
 the salad the other way in which 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.009
 it is delicious is using it as if 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.440
 out sauce on the chicken to the 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.569
 grill another way in which also 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.090
 comes out very good is with soft tacos 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.069
 fish I just mix a little bit of 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.620
 cucumber salad with fish and the 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.319
 I put inside the tortilla is very 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.229
 well cucumbers have a certain amount 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.030
 of vitamins and minerals but almost alone 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:17.699
 they contain water so the values 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.830
 nutrients are not very high on the other 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.979
 side a cup of cucumber slices 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.810
 has approximately 15 calories and already 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.599
 I did not add grease to the salad and 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.300
 just a small amount of sweetener 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:33.060
 It is also a salad with very few 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.849
 calories is wonderful to be able to eat something 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.530
 practically it has no calories and already 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.870
 that this salad is also kept 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.240
 Maybe you want to do what I do 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.159
 prepare enough quantity to be able to 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.960
 eat for several days 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:48.240
 I love having it to nibble when 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.400
 I crave something crispy and salty 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.400
 since that is much healthier
