00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.869
 of the artistic line is very very 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 beautiful the color we choose the people 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.079
 to make our cause more beautiful 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.360
 more cast mold you find yourself 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.090
 talk about it while serving time for 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.270
 there can do at home understand it takes a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.270
 and cut out one cardboard paper that 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 You want the lina one more tape 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 Crepe 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.409
 ok scissors and scissors 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.810
 Just there, fake it and the pants look. 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.420
 now we go step by step to see how 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 will stay in your play and now we will 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 pass the crepe tape but the cause has 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 that being passed on to him is fine 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 strap you position the idea had 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.039
 vehicles falling the crash site 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.039
 This cool, I'll help you here so 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.900
 well positioned you get to go to there 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.800
 people are going to spend another one and then we 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.480
 Here's another one around here. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.940
 of crepe tape né 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.160
 ottawa seeing how it was because the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.310
 insulation we're talking about is not just 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.590
 This lac comes back to when you give 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.320
 a jet it is logical that he will expect a 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.140
 five more were 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.570
 simple does not have work we have here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.090
 Isolation this and there we will hold 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.430
 so upright I tried to hold it here 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.800
 To help you, you know that the spray 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.200
 We have to do this, give us 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.090
 circulatory movements pee and then the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.820
 important is that we never used 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.459
 spray inclined from 30 and 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.850
 11 hours incentives not invest 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.380
 them this and we'll give the right spray 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 There and then you'll put it to dry in the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.840
 horizontal understanding is that 15 minutes 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.970
 So let's go back and let's take another 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.620
 defeat but let's get going now 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.620
 Let's wait a little bit, we'll be back. 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.140
 to another procedure very well 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.970
 we came back and now what will this be? 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.790
 procedure that we should do this 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.799
 Now then upright, we're going to give 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.530
 another jet because they do not always 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.030
 can now al uniform with 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.549
 wins every demand you go 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.940
 standardize the image that we are not going 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.610
 always remembering that it is always in the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260
 in the vertical position the tubing should be 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.450
 I do not understand that 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.820
 This is important now we are going 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.790
 then lay horizontally and wait 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.980
 more than 20 thousand hectares for 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.560
 drying and you'll see it a little bit 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.480
 How's our cause going to be beautiful? 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.920
 after applying the third hand 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.140
 Let's see how it got to our cause. 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.180
 Shame on us, let's go cheerleading. 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.459
 anxious to know how it's going to stay 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.760
 take off slowly so take the strike 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.780
 is that we use to seal this space 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.640
 Are you going to take this look? 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.490
 pretty 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.470
 let's talk in legal look to it 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.630
 after the third hand 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.660
 Look, people, look, just take a look at the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.080
 our cause is blue closes with fantasy 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.700
 do not look, it's already said think, and it's not lonely anymore 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.669
 imagine what we'll do next 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.680
 No, I do not have problem, not only. 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.950
 tired of a jet on these things here 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.870
 the mimosa had already told me the people 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.890

 life changes life this band stays very 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.500

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.330
 piece because wood as wood 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.020
 because in fact this boyle wood does not 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.020
