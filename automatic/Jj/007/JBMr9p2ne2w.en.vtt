00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.520
 me 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:15.070
 I have not mentioned version 1.8. 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 It is have as self-proclaimed tofu mental 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:26.360
 First you remove the headquarters of the bandits that the last discovery 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.360
 Put the maid for item collection on the helicopter 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.570
 Arrived safely 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.410
 Since the bandits will be resurrected at night, the sun is rising to some extent 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.410
 Removal and you 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.960
 We use this dynamite for removal 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:05.140
 Explosion of the items caught in the explosion of dna and craftsman disappears, but this dynamite 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 The item does not disappear in the blast 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.250
 Since the range is narrow slightly that the easy to use earlier in the autumn leaves pavilion nt be processed into a dynamite 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.250
 Also 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.010
 2x 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010
 me 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.659
 me 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.750
 me 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.390
 Then detonate 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.509
 that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 Ag 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.570
 I'm sorry Ne maid Concern 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.110
 Well don't worry 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.870
 Only the skin 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.290
 Get rid of your mind and blast 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.610
 Put Huh 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.610
 Thus was Nanda' 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.710
 The remaining part of dynamite is no longer will be dismantled by hand 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.430
 That's why the mission accomplished 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.430
 r Perry 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.350
 Then we will go into this construction work 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:30.890
 By the way, several constructions have already been completed 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.260
 A house without a ninth power of sand wall or a simple fountain 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.490
 And pig coop 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:44.340
 A staircase-like building made of tofu on the opposite side of it 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:53.690
 This building is a field with an automatic harvesting function 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.690
 When you press this switch, the water will be rubber and the crops will flow through the bar. 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.410
 Hmm 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.640
 The long crop is piped to the chest 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.810
 Hmm 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:16.590
 Left to give not after 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.100
 It also does I rubber Ah by the time you grew up 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.770
 Other we made also sheep of the hut 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:32.770
 We make pumpkin field in the back this time 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:39.960
 Pumpkin is one of the crops that consumes a lot because it is used for lighting jack orangutans 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:43.110
 The pumpkin brought from the cabbage village has consumed most at the desert village street 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:49.160
 Because it is troublesome to go back to the Betsumura one by one 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.160
 We decided to make pumpkin field which streamlined harvest 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.420
 Hmm 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.490
 2 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.650
 We will consider other applications in the future, so we will make them larger 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.650
 Hmm 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.950
 Hmm 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.890
 Hmm 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.890
 Uzzah 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.360
 Hmm 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 Hmm 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.370
 voodoo 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.370
 Hm 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.540
 Hmm 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.980
 N Boone 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.100
ã‚“voodoo 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.100
 Minutes 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.670
 Hmm 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.670
 Hmm 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.070
 It does not mean that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:26.230
 It was possible 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:32.670
 The windmill is a bamboo mod but it is small so I prefer moving rafts . 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.670
 The inside is a simultaneous recovery type with ordinary pistons 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.840
 The contents of the windmill are empty 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:55.110
 Jack the pumpkin automatically as soon as the materials are ready 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.110
 I would like to make a device to make it an orangutan 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:05.790
 By the way, the residence of the base also has undergone some renovations 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.600
 We expanded a part and made it a power generation facility 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.600
 me 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:23.630
 Cable is connected to the Marine Day refining facility to house 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.360
 But this power plant 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.360
 Power is not enough 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:34.090
 I would like to refrain from using thermal power 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.090
 I can not make a generator because the materials are scarce 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.210
 I want to hurry the introduction of girly 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.870
 This time we will see you again next time 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.870
