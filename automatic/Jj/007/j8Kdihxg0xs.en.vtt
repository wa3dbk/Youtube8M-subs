about this phone is obviously its screen
which<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> 5.5<00:00:23.400> inch<00:00:23.760> 720p<00:00:24.600> IPS<00:00:25.939> display<00:00:26.939> now

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
which is a 5.5 inch 720p IPS display now

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.380 
which is a 5.5 inch 720p IPS display now
as<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.529> noticed<00:00:28.920> earlier<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> comes

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
as we have noticed earlier when it comes

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.080 
as we have noticed earlier when it comes
to<00:00:30.710> screen<00:00:31.710> sizes<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.399> about<00:00:32.700> 5<00:00:33.059> inches

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to screen sizes that are about 5 inches

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.979 
to screen sizes that are about 5 inches
and<00:00:33.630> larger<00:00:34.280> even<00:00:35.280> though<00:00:35.399> 720p<00:00:36.270> looks<00:00:36.630> good

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and larger even though 720p looks good

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
and larger even though 720p looks good
it<00:00:37.710> still<00:00:38.370> does<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> same<00:00:39.180> fidelity

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it still does not have the same fidelity

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.170 
it still does not have the same fidelity
obviously<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.550> 1080p<00:00:41.550> display<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.059> can

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
obviously as a 1080p display you can

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.470 
obviously as a 1080p display you can
still<00:00:42.420> make<00:00:42.629> out<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.200> slight<00:00:44.390> gradients<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
still make out the slight gradients that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
still make out the slight gradients that
you<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.379> make<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.680> each<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.370> every

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.130 
see we have this switch from the outside
looks<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.729> good<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> inside<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
looks pretty good but on the inside you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.700 
looks pretty good but on the inside you
see<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.649> quite<00:02:10.920> flimsy<00:02:11.370> plastic<00:02:11.730> so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
see it is quite flimsy plastic so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.040 
see it is quite flimsy plastic so
chances<00:02:14.070> are<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.550> mean<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.240> would<00:02:15.420> definitely

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
chances are I mean you would definitely

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.900 
chances are I mean you would definitely
not<00:02:16.200> want<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.710> keep<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.160> back<00:02:17.430> panel<00:02:17.640> out

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
not want to keep this back panel out

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.240 
not want to keep this back panel out
very<00:02:18.630> often<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.380> very<00:02:19.650> very<00:02:19.950> thin

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
very often because it's very very thin

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.930 
very often because it's very very thin
so<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.540> make<00:02:21.960> sure<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.440> always

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
so just make sure that it's always

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.490 
so just make sure that it's always
clipped<00:02:23.940> onto<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> phone<00:02:24.570> because<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
clipped onto the phone because then it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.250 
clipped onto the phone because then it
adds<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.510> feeling<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.630> solidity

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
adds to that feeling of solidity

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.500 
adds to that feeling of solidity
otherwise<00:02:28.710> it's<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.910> flimsy

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
otherwise it's really just a flimsy

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.530 
otherwise it's really just a flimsy
piece<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.810> plastic<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.700> let's<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.390> this

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
piece of plastic right so let's get this

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
piece of plastic right so let's get this
closed<00:02:33.900> right<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.150> now<00:02:36.150> moving<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.780> let's<00:02:37.410> look

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
closed right so now moving on let's look

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
closed right so now moving on let's look
at<00:02:37.710> some<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.100> ports<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.700> micro<00:02:39.030> SD<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
at some of the ports the micro SD and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.990 
at some of the ports the micro SD and
the<00:02:39.690> sim<00:02:40.050> card<00:02:40.080> slots<00:02:40.530> are<00:02:40.680> all<00:02:41.000> obviously

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the sim card slots are all obviously

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.570 
the sim card slots are all obviously
beneath<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.110> panel<00:02:43.440> out<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
beneath the panel out here we have the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.510 
beneath the panel out here we have the
power<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.300> lock<00:02:46.110> button<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.680> out<00:02:47.220> here<00:02:47.490> we

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
power on lock button and out here we

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.060 
power on lock button and out here we
have<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.940> volume<00:02:48.390> keys<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:49.770> about<00:02:49.920> it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
have the volume keys and that's about it

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.140 
have the volume keys and that's about it
out<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.590> micro<00:02:52.590> USB<00:02:53.040> port<00:02:53.940> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
out here you have the micro USB port and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.200 
out here you have the micro USB port and
here<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.020> 3.5<00:02:55.440> mm<00:02:55.800> headphone<00:02:56.310> jack

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
here we have the 3.5 mm headphone jack

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.630 
here we have the 3.5 mm headphone jack
and<00:02:57.480> that's<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.560> that's<00:02:58.770> pretty<00:02:59.220> much<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.520> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and that's it that's pretty much one it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.950 
and that's it that's pretty much one it
when<00:02:59.820> it<00:02:59.940> comes<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.330> ports<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
when it comes to the ports we have the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.420 
when it comes to the ports we have the
speaker<00:03:01.260> grill<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.650> back<00:03:01.890> but<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.280> like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
speaker grill at the back but it's like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.270 
speaker grill at the back but it's like
one<00:03:02.610> single<00:03:03.320> grill<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:04.590> which<00:03:04.770> where<00:03:05.190> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
one single grill from which where the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.660 
one single grill from which where the
entire<00:03:05.550> audio<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.090> outputted<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:07.530> let's<00:03:08.160> get

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
entire audio is outputted now let's get

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.650 
entire audio is outputted now let's get
into<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.240> phone<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.710> phone<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:11.330> powered<00:03:12.330> by<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
into the phone the phone is powered by a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.140 
into the phone the phone is powered by a
1.2<00:03:12.870> gig<00:03:13.440> media<00:03:13.830> tech<00:03:14.070> quad<00:03:14.550> core<00:03:14.820> processor

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
1.2 gig media tech quad core processor

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.370 
1.2 gig media tech quad core processor
has<00:03:15.420> 1gb<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.350> RAM<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:18.090> as<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.480> can<00:03:18.900> see<00:03:19.110> for

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
has 1gb of RAM so as you can see for

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.420 
has 1gb of RAM so as you can see for
about<00:03:19.710> twelve<00:03:19.950> thousand<00:03:20.250> eight<00:03:20.340> hundred

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
about twelve thousand eight hundred

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.540 
about twelve thousand eight hundred
these<00:03:21.270> are<00:03:21.480> pretty<00:03:21.750> good<00:03:21.960> specs<00:03:22.350> if<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:23.130> go<00:03:23.490> to

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
these are pretty good specs if we go to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.490 
these are pretty good specs if we go to
the<00:03:23.790> actual<00:03:24.090> interface<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.900> will<00:03:24.930> see<00:03:25.230> that

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the actual interface you will see that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.060 
the actual interface you will see that
it<00:03:25.800> doesn't<00:03:26.010> lag<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:27.450> actually<00:03:28.230> works<00:03:28.650> very

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
it doesn't lag it actually works very

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.870 
it doesn't lag it actually works very
smoothly<00:03:29.430> which<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.330> nice<00:03:31.050> deal<00:03:31.380> at<00:03:31.880> 12,800

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
smoothly which is a nice deal at 12,800

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.930 
smoothly which is a nice deal at 12,800
you<00:03:32.970> expect<00:03:33.480> you've<00:03:34.320> had<00:03:34.890> bad<00:03:35.100> experiences

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
you expect you've had bad experiences

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.060 
you expect you've had bad experiences
with<00:03:36.000> phones<00:03:36.780> earlier<00:03:37.170> especially<00:03:37.890> those

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
with phones earlier especially those

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.040 
with phones earlier especially those
running<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.490> MediaTek<00:03:39.060> processor<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.900> as

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
running the MediaTek processor but as

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.680 
running the MediaTek processor but as
you<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.640> phone<00:03:41.640> doesnt<00:03:42.030> lag<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
you can see this phone doesnt lag the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.890 
you can see this phone doesnt lag the
touch<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.440> smooth<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.920> response<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.430> accurate

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
touch of smooth the response is accurate

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.320 
touch of smooth the response is accurate
if<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.230> can<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.740> jump<00:03:47.130> into<00:03:47.400> maybe<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.030> message

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
if I can just jump into maybe a message

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.820 
if I can just jump into maybe a message
and<00:03:48.840> see<00:03:49.290> how<00:03:49.680> well<00:03:50.520> even<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.830> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
and see how well even the the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.710 
and see how well even the the
touchscreen<00:03:53.250> keyboard<00:03:53.580> works<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.540> out<00:03:54.690> here

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
touchscreen keyboard works so out here

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:08.309 
touchscreen keyboard works so out here
let's<00:03:55.080> see<00:03:57.380> let's<00:03:58.380> type<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.890> here

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.259 

as<00:04:08.409> you<00:04:08.890> can<00:04:08.980> see<00:04:09.129> it's<00:04:09.310> pretty<00:04:09.519> standard<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
as you can see it's pretty standard the

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.239 
as you can see it's pretty standard the
keyboard<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.749> standard<00:04:11.739> but<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.040> good<00:04:12.219> thing

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:12.249 
keyboard is standard but the good thing

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.469 
keyboard is standard but the good thing
is<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.689> there<00:04:13.689> is<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:15.010> responsive<00:04:15.670> which

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
is that there is it is responsive which

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.779 
is that there is it is responsive which
is<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.780> guess<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.989> rule<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:18.130> end<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.489> cannot

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
is I guess a rule that the end I cannot

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.689 
is I guess a rule that the end I cannot
that<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.900> entire<00:04:20.169> interface<00:04:20.560> follows<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.370> a
