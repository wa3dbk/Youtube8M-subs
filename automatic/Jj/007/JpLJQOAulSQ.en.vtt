 inches and a half thick 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.280
 their airflow is 52 points 19 cef 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 in which brand is smaller than the other is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 smaller but it is because this one here edition 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.549
 kuaite before someone says but nothing is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.950
 a cooler for giovanni airflow does not 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 It's for performance to keep you going. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 order flow of your machine and gives you 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.200
 look cooler on her but still 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 52 fm is a cfm baita it 's a thing to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.640
 Heck, it works at the speed of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.189
 1,500 rpm with noise level of 25.2 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 decibels is quite acceptable they also serve 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.689
 by the air flow that he has the day he 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.649
 it makes a very low noise the pressure is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.680
 0.75 Chair and Lesson Connectors 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.290
 or three-pin speed 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 does not change works 100% of the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.890
 time it news 500 rpm 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.570
 taking a look at the back of the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.469
 box and I showed you that he 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.659
 has aversion and with led red blue purple 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.979
 and there's one more that we can not 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.319
 buy it but it also has a version 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.880
 after they learned of the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.380
 people go 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.390
 between them to take a look at what 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.610
 sell accessories with him for you 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.300
 do everything else and then 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 followed 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.040
 We're going to call them and we 'll call them. 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.440
 to show you how it's that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.600
 It operates the lighting of them is cool 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.880
 it gets weak it gets stronger everything else like 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.430
 open here the thing outside the house was 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.070
 with his design is very similar to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.710
 The jetco game was talking here, right? 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.900
 but there are some very visible differences 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.960
 first he has not got any here 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.760
 finisher then if you place 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.530
 for example a radiator something else 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.790
 the screw that passes here has 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.460
 to be careful of it not from here 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.730
 ends up pressing and breaking dome 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.680
 it has no rubber body finish 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.140
 it is totally standard plastic 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.460
 here use the bolts of it are also 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.480
 that kind of screw you have to 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.450
 make the temporary thread of that one 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.880
 skin will cut and plastic and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.820
 give that film kitchen grip too 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.920
 transparent side stay here on the side 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.230
 should absorb well illumination so that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.500
 say the three pin connector 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.910
 his car is well kept but I just 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.140
 I got into it to give it to you, it's well done. 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.120
 his car is 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.080
 What if this is a positive point? 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.030
 in him 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.040
 and as I mentioned the three connectors that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 means that it does not change the rotation 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.510
 He comes along with it. It's very simple. 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.020
 Let's call them here now, see you. 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.020
 How do you stay? 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:56.170
 they found in the lighting colors 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.170
 theirs is very, very cool you found 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:06.380
 that banana face is lighting 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.600
 I think it was a cool point. 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.870
 This is very strong and I think 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.490

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.430
