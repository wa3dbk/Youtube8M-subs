00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
also I've tried all sorts of proteins

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.640 
also I've tried all sorts of proteins
creatine's<00:00:17.250> test<00:00:17.640> boosters<00:00:18.060> etc<00:00:18.600> some<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> it

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
creatine's test boosters etc some of it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.170 
creatine's test boosters etc some of it
showed<00:00:19.890> results<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.789> there's<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> which

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
showed results and that there's a which

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.540 
showed results and that there's a which
didn't<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:22.199> over<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> course<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> last<00:00:22.859> five

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
didn't but over the course the last five

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.340 
didn't but over the course the last five
years<00:00:23.580> or<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.180> I've<00:00:24.300> noticed<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> market

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
years or so I've noticed that the market

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650 
years or so I've noticed that the market
is<00:00:25.410> become<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:25.980> saturated<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.150> all<00:00:27.300> sorts

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
is become just saturated with all sorts

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.620 
is become just saturated with all sorts
of<00:00:27.720> overripe<00:00:28.320> overpriced<00:00:29.130> garbage<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
of overripe overpriced garbage so I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
of overripe overpriced garbage so I
decided<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> take<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> natural<00:00:32.130> approach<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
decided to take the natural approach and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
decided to take the natural approach and
just<00:00:32.790> make<00:00:33.090> some<00:00:33.120> changes<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.870> diet<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
just make some changes to my diet and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.850 
just make some changes to my diet and
see<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.860> despite

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
see if I could go with that despite

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.680 
see if I could go with that despite
making<00:00:38.040> significant<00:00:38.670> changes<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.239> diet<00:00:39.270> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
making significant changes to my diet I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
making significant changes to my diet I
still<00:00:39.960> noticed<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.469> slight<00:00:40.739> decrease<00:00:41.190> in

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
still noticed a slight decrease in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
still noticed a slight decrease in
energy<00:00:41.750> stamina<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> strength<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.440> gym

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
energy stamina and strength in the gym

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
energy stamina and strength in the gym
I<00:00:44.010> run<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> volume<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.149> reps<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.930> sets<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I run a volume of reps and sets that I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
I run a volume of reps and sets that I
could<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.890> etc<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> decided<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.809> do

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
could put out in etc so I decided to do

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
could put out in etc so I decided to do
some<00:00:49.440> extensive<00:00:49.710> research<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
some extensive research and see if I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
some extensive research and see if I
could<00:00:50.940> find<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> product<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.230> give<00:00:52.410> me

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
could find a product that could give me

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
could find a product that could give me
some<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.980> energy<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.670> had<00:00:53.820> lost<00:00:54.030> back

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
some of that energy that I had lost back

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
some of that energy that I had lost back

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
my time so I feel like I would just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.190 
my time so I feel like I would just
continue<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.390> around<00:01:18.630> two<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> three
