00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
have to have a dance background I think

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.330 
have to have a dance background I think
so<00:03:21.090> natural<00:03:21.570> ability<00:03:21.930> definitely<00:03:22.440> helps<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
so natural ability definitely helps and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.970 
so natural ability definitely helps and
you<00:03:23.700> know<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.600> just<00:03:24.660> depends<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:25.350> what<00:03:25.650> how<00:03:25.799> it

feels

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109
