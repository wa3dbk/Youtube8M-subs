you<00:02:16.910> can<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.230> was<00:02:18.590> not<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> frame

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
you can see but I was not in the frame

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.340 
you can see but I was not in the frame
and<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:19.880> decided<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.450> edit<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.870> part<00:02:21.200> out

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and so I decided to edit that part out

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.200 
and so I decided to edit that part out
so<00:02:21.560> we're<00:02:21.680> gonna<00:02:21.800> start<00:02:22.160> with<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.520> next

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
so we're gonna start with this next

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.340 
so we're gonna start with this next
section<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:25.820> had<00:02:26.030> begun<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.360> dry<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.260> I'm

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
section it had begun to dry out so I'm

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.620 
section it had begun to dry out so I'm
not<00:02:27.530> using<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> aloe<00:02:28.310> vera<00:02:28.630> moisturizing

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630

mixture that I use everyday and it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.850 
mixture that I use everyday and it's
very<00:02:35.180> important<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.990> make<00:02:36.500> sure<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
onto the hair starting at the root I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.229 
onto the hair starting at the root I
don't<00:02:45.980> know<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:46.760> important<00:02:47.209> that

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
don't know that it's so important that

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.940 
don't know that it's so important that
you<00:02:47.360> start<00:02:47.660> at<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> root<00:02:48.110> that's<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.680> what

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
you start at the root that's just what

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.410 
you start at the root that's just what
I'm<00:02:49.070> doing<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.610> I'm<00:02:52.670> just<00:02:52.820> making<00:02:53.180> sure<00:02:53.360> that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
I'm doing so I'm just making sure that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.870 
I'm doing so I'm just making sure that
there<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.989> gel<00:02:55.959> on<00:02:56.959> each<00:02:57.459> strand<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.640> hair

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
there is gel on each strand of hair

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.750 
there is gel on each strand of hair
that's<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.420> section

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that's in that section

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.640 
that's in that section
now<00:03:01.760> I'm<00:03:01.940> smoothing<00:03:02.450> starting<00:03:03.140> at<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.380> tip

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
now I'm smoothing starting at the tip

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.830 
now I'm smoothing starting at the tip
and<00:03:03.920> working<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.550> way<00:03:04.580> up<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.510> very

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
and working my way up it's very

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.580 
and working my way up it's very
important<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.530> smooth<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.610> now<00:03:08.239> I'm

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
important to smooth and now I'm

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
important to smooth and now I'm
separating<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.739> hair<00:03:09.980> smooth<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.500> separate

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
separating the hair smooth and separate

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.880 
separating the hair smooth and separate
smooth<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:14.239> then<00:03:14.600> separate<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:17.530> okay<00:03:18.530> once

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
smooth and then separate it okay once

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.920 
smooth and then separate it okay once
you<00:03:19.130> separate<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.760> your<00:03:19.940> liking<00:03:20.150> then<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
you separate it to your liking then you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.930 
you separate it to your liking then you
just<00:03:21.200> take<00:03:21.380> your<00:03:21.560> fingers<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.160> just<00:03:22.549> do<00:03:22.790> that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
just take your fingers and just do that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.199 
just take your fingers and just do that
one<00:03:23.239> last<00:03:23.480> rake<00:03:23.989> through<00:03:24.850> let<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.970> hair<00:03:26.180> fall

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
one last rake through let the hair fall

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.890 
one last rake through let the hair fall
how<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.290> wants<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.709> fall<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.630> then<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.720> can

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
how it wants to fall and then you can

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.720 
how it wants to fall and then you can
just<00:03:30.019> leave<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.440> alone<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:33.340> that's<00:03:34.340> how<00:03:34.519> it's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
just leave it alone and that's how it's

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.990 
just leave it alone and that's how it's
looking<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.239> far<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.870> basically<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.130> followed

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
looking so far and basically I followed

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.940 
looking so far and basically I followed
that<00:03:38.120> same<00:03:38.420> procedure<00:03:38.799> throughout<00:03:39.799> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
that same procedure throughout the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:05:45.189 
that same procedure throughout the
entire<00:03:40.280> head

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.879 

and<00:05:46.199> we're<00:05:46.620> all<00:05:46.860> done<00:05:47.840> okay<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:48.990> decided<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.740> put

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
and we're all done okay I decided to put

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.800 
and we're all done okay I decided to put
those<00:05:50.069> silver<00:05:50.610> clamps<00:05:51.090> there<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.630> keep

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
those silver clamps there just to keep

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.439 
those silver clamps there just to keep
the<00:05:51.990> hair<00:05:52.199> separated<00:05:52.889> but<00:05:53.849> I'm<00:05:53.970> gonna<00:05:54.120> turn

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
the hair separated but I'm gonna turn

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.510 
the hair separated but I'm gonna turn
around<00:05:54.569> so<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:54.990> can<00:05:55.139> see<00:05:55.169> how<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.979> hair<00:05:56.190> looks

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
around so you can see how the hair looks

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.279 
around so you can see how the hair looks
from<00:05:57.270> each<00:05:57.720> angle<00:05:59.180> there<00:06:00.180> is<00:06:00.330> no<00:06:00.690> buildup

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
from each angle there is no buildup

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.589 
from each angle there is no buildup
there<00:06:01.770> was<00:06:01.979> no<00:06:02.280> residue<00:06:02.819> that<00:06:03.000> was<00:06:03.150> one<00:06:03.389> of<00:06:03.509> the

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
there was no residue that was one of the

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.809 
there was no residue that was one of the
first<00:06:04.020> things<00:06:04.319> that<00:06:04.409> I<00:06:04.560> noticed<00:06:05.009> as<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.669> was

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
first things that I noticed as I was

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.279 
first things that I noticed as I was
applying<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.479> gel<00:06:07.259> to<00:06:07.530> my<00:06:07.680> hair<00:06:09.110> now<00:06:10.110> there's

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
applying the gel to my hair now there's

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.469 
applying the gel to my hair now there's
not<00:06:10.500> really<00:06:10.680> much<00:06:11.009> to<00:06:11.250> say<00:06:11.280> at<00:06:11.580> this<00:06:11.789> point<00:06:12.150> you

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
not really much to say at this point you

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.510 
not really much to say at this point you
know<00:06:12.599> it<00:06:12.780> just<00:06:12.810> feels<00:06:13.169> like<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.440> regular<00:06:13.770> wash

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
know it just feels like a regular wash

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.990 
know it just feels like a regular wash
and<00:06:14.789> go<00:06:14.940> it's<00:06:15.180> pretty<00:06:15.479> wet<00:06:16.460> you<00:06:17.460> know<00:06:17.610> but<00:06:17.849> it

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
and go it's pretty wet you know but it

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.270 
and go it's pretty wet you know but it
doesn't<00:06:18.360> feel<00:06:18.539> icky<00:06:19.050> or<00:06:19.259> sticky<00:06:19.860> or<00:06:19.949> anything

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
doesn't feel icky or sticky or anything

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.899 
doesn't feel icky or sticky or anything
like<00:06:20.639> that<00:06:20.669> I<00:06:21.770> won't<00:06:22.770> really<00:06:22.949> see<00:06:23.310> in<00:06:23.639> any

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
like that I won't really see in any

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.089 
like that I won't really see in any
major<00:06:24.240> results<00:06:24.900> until<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.289> dries<00:06:25.590> but<00:06:25.949> for

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
major results until it dries but for

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.040 
major results until it dries but for
right<00:06:26.250> now<00:06:26.310> you<00:06:27.180> know<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.419> hair<00:06:27.630> is<00:06:27.750> falling

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
right now you know the hair is falling
