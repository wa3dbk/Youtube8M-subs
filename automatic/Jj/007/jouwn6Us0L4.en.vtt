00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.920 
the white is a little different for me
to<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> colored<00:02:14.120> version<00:02:14.569> instead<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
to get a colored version instead of

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
to get a colored version instead of
having<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:16.130> know<00:02:16.220> your<00:02:16.370> standard<00:02:16.550> grey<00:02:16.850> or

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
having a you know your standard grey or

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000 
having a you know your standard grey or
black<00:02:17.180> or<00:02:17.540> wouldn't<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.620> know<00:02:18.709> what<00:02:18.890> other

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
black or wouldn't it you know what other

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.640 
black or wouldn't it you know what other
other<00:02:19.850> colours<00:02:20.180> Regas<00:02:20.510> have<00:02:20.720> some<00:02:21.470> pretty

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
other colours Regas have some pretty

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.380 
other colours Regas have some pretty
funky<00:02:21.890> colors<00:02:22.310> they<00:02:22.460> have<00:02:22.490> like<00:02:22.760> some<00:02:22.940> red<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
funky colors they have like some red and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.300 
funky colors they have like some red and
greens<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.900> stuff<00:02:23.960> but<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.380> don't<00:02:24.560> prefer

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
greens and stuff but I don't prefer

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.850 
greens and stuff but I don't prefer
those<00:02:25.460> very<00:02:25.730> much<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.900> one<00:02:27.080> has<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
those very much this one has the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.090 
those very much this one has the
Arby<00:02:28.370> 303<00:02:29.210> tonearm<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.170> new<00:02:30.470> updated

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
Arby 303 tonearm so it's the new updated

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100 
Arby 303 tonearm so it's the new updated
tonearm<00:02:32.050> obviously<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:34.400> know<00:02:35.110> fully

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
tonearm obviously this is you know fully

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.690 
tonearm obviously this is you know fully
manual<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.540> did<00:02:38.900> lose<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:39.380> bit<00:02:39.500> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
manual so I did lose a little bit of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.700 
manual so I did lose a little bit of
ease-of-use<00:02:40.700> when<00:02:41.600> with<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.930> techniques<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
ease-of-use when with my techniques the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.430 
ease-of-use when with my techniques the
one<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.040> had<00:02:43.220> was<00:02:43.430> full<00:02:43.760> auto<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
one that I had was full auto so that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.110 
one that I had was full auto so that
takes<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.710> while<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.860> get<00:02:46.040> back<00:02:46.100> used<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
takes a while to get back used to you

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120 
takes a while to get back used to you
know<00:02:47.240> having<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.380> go<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.530> lift<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.860> needle

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
know having to go and lift the needle

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.920 
know having to go and lift the needle
when<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.370> over<00:02:49.610> instead<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.210> you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
when it's over instead of it just you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.490 
when it's over instead of it just you
know<00:02:51.880> stopping<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:52.970> its<00:02:53.090> own<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.290> have

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
know stopping on its own but I have

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.900 
know stopping on its own but I have
noticed<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.920> pretty<00:02:55.700> dramatic<00:02:55.940> sound<00:02:56.510> increase

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
noticed a pretty dramatic sound increase

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.730 
noticed a pretty dramatic sound increase
in<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.180> table<00:02:59.540> from<00:02:59.750> my<00:02:59.990> techniques<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.530> still

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
in this table from my techniques I still

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.150 
in this table from my techniques I still
run<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.070> through<00:03:01.220> my<00:03:01.510> Peachtree<00:03:02.510> audio<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.260> I

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
run it through my Peachtree audio and I

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.460 
run it through my Peachtree audio and I
just<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> relatively<00:03:05.209> cheap<00:03:05.350> phone<00:03:06.350> no

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
just have a relatively cheap phone no

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
preamp the same one that I have them

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.960 
preamp the same one that I have them
that's<00:03:08.270> my<00:03:08.420> next<00:03:08.660> upgrade<00:03:08.900> hopefully<00:03:09.470> but<00:03:10.370> I'm

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970
