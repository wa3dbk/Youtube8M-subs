00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.530 

just<00:02:39.190> start<00:02:39.370> by<00:02:39.489> forming<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.910> mound<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.239> mortar

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
just start by forming a mound of mortar

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.229 
just start by forming a mound of mortar
around<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.900> perimeter<00:02:41.349> of<00:02:41.380> your<00:02:41.500> shower<00:02:41.800> pan

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
around the perimeter of your shower pan

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.960 
around the perimeter of your shower pan
you<00:02:43.239> can<00:02:43.270> build<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.780> mound<00:02:44.050> high<00:02:44.970> then

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
you can build this mound high then

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.449 
you can build this mound high then
you're<00:02:46.060> going<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.209> pack<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.690> down<00:02:47.459> hence

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
you're going to pack that down hence

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.790 
you're going to pack that down hence
again<00:02:48.849> dry<00:02:49.209> out<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.739> got<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.890> dry<00:02:51.190> mud

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
again dry out so you got the dry mud

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.839 
again dry out so you got the dry mud
right<00:02:53.800> now<00:02:54.750> lawyer<00:02:55.750> wouldn't<00:02:55.989> flow<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.760> you

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
right now lawyer wouldn't flow so you

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.220 
right now lawyer wouldn't flow so you
want<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.030> build<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.300> kind<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.599> high<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.110> then

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
want to build that kind of high and then

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.550 
want to build that kind of high and then
beat<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.590> down<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.190> your<00:03:00.280> 2<00:03:00.489> inch<00:03:00.519> thickness

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
beat it down to your 2 inch thickness

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.750 
beat it down to your 2 inch thickness
here<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.620> think<00:03:02.769> we're<00:03:03.069> about<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.400> pull<00:03:03.580> out<00:03:03.730> our

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
here I think we're about to pull out our

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.330 
here I think we're about to pull out our
tape<00:03:04.060> measure<00:03:04.560> take<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> measurement<00:03:05.950> off<00:03:06.190> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
tape measure take a measurement off of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
tape measure take a measurement off of
our<00:03:06.459> mark<00:03:07.080> see<00:03:08.080> how<00:03:08.230> close<00:03:08.470> we<00:03:08.650> are

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
our mark see how close we are

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.619 
our mark see how close we are
and<00:03:11.470> for<00:03:12.069> our<00:03:12.159> first<00:03:12.370> go<00:03:12.549> on<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.970> we're<00:03:13.209> just

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
and for our first go on it we're just

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.640 
and for our first go on it we're just
about<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:13.959> now<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.959> technique<00:03:17.379> but<00:03:17.560> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
about there now this technique but you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.949 
about there now this technique but you
see<00:03:17.769> me<00:03:17.890> doing<00:03:17.920> here<00:03:18.569> forming<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:19.599> rail<00:03:19.780> around

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
see me doing here forming a rail around

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.619 
see me doing here forming a rail around
the<00:03:20.170> perimeter<00:03:20.909> right<00:03:21.909> here<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.330> is<00:03:22.390> about

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
the perimeter right here this is about

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.479 
the perimeter right here this is about
as<00:03:22.780> basic<00:03:22.989> asset<00:03:23.620> as<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:24.010> gets<00:03:24.220> with<00:03:24.340> this

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
as basic asset as it gets with this

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.089 
as basic asset as it gets with this
5-foot<00:03:25.450> tub<00:03:25.870> opening<00:03:26.319> but<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.950> can

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
5-foot tub opening but you can you can

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.640 
5-foot tub opening but you can you can
use<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> same<00:03:27.700> technique<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:29.049> any<00:03:29.319> size

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
use the same technique on any size

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.210 
use the same technique on any size
shower<00:03:30.069> pimp<00:03:30.430> any<00:03:31.269> shape<00:03:31.659> any<00:03:31.840> size<00:03:32.170> I've<00:03:32.769> done

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
shower pimp any shape any size I've done

this<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:33.849> full<00:03:34.420> pulled<00:03:34.720> X<00:03:35.640> Ln<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.739> know

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
this out on full pulled X Ln I you know

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.009 
this out on full pulled X Ln I you know
anything<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.610> need<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.940> build<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.510> slope

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
anything that you need to build a slope

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:51.539 
anything that you need to build a slope
so<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.489> then<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.970> can't<00:03:43.239> go<00:03:45.450> there<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.459> you

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
so and then you can't go there so you

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.589 
so and then you can't go there so you
keep<00:03:51.640> building<00:03:51.910> your<00:03:52.030> way<00:03:52.209> around<00:03:52.329> the

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
keep building your way around the

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.660 
keep building your way around the
perimeter<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:52.989> your<00:03:53.230> town<00:03:53.489> take<00:03:54.489> your<00:03:54.609> time

perimeter of your town take your time

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.630 
perimeter of your town take your time
with<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.409> work<00:03:56.409> everything<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.099> flat<00:03:57.400> level

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
with it work everything to a flat level

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.750 
with it work everything to a flat level
playing

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.630 

your<00:04:01.299> technique<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:03.250> takes<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.549> little

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
your technique down it takes a little

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.350 
your technique down it takes a little
bit<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.849> practice<00:04:04.330> but<00:04:04.599> I<00:04:05.610> got<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.970> this

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
bit of practice but I got it that this

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.509 
bit of practice but I got it that this
whole<00:04:07.540> pan<00:04:07.810> itself<00:04:08.140> only<00:04:08.680> took<00:04:08.950> me<00:04:09.099> about<00:04:09.129> two

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
whole pan itself only took me about two

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.869 
whole pan itself only took me about two
hours<00:04:09.579> start<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.299> finish<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:12.489> know<00:04:12.640> if<00:04:12.730> this

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
hours start to finish you know if this

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.780 
hours start to finish you know if this
is<00:04:12.970> your<00:04:13.030> first<00:04:13.299> time<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.510> probably<00:04:13.840> take<00:04:14.079> you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
is your first time I probably take you

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.050 
is your first time I probably take you
quite<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.849> bit<00:04:15.939> longer<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:18.549> know<00:04:21.060> it's

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
quite a bit longer but you know it's

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.890 
quite a bit longer but you know it's
it's<00:04:22.660> it's<00:04:23.500> all<00:04:23.710> in<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.979> learning<00:04:24.310> curve<00:04:24.900> I'm

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
it's it's all in the learning curve I'm
