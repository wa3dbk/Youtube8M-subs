00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.580
 Yes then we will give you a present this time 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.930
 I would like to explain the template of this lp 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.280
 It's very easy to put pictures and videos 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.080
 Of course I decorated the letters 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.070
 Is Toka forwarder window so local governments Toka give them this kind of heading various things 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.150
 I can do it 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.220
 That's why I think that I would like to introduce you in order 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:50.440
 Or the embed It is the header image in this kind of feeling if 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:56.440
 Here is how to use expert email in the form of embedding a form like this 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:01.030
 You can also generate it, but you can embed it in this template here 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:05.210
 Automatically It is a German-English Dokusha's expert mail position Once you got signed up for 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:11.430
 It says that you can become the e-mail magazine readers's there can be another automatically 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 Yeah Once you have signed up for this in this kind of form such it is with it because there is a system as 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:23.900
 You can create a system that makes you become an e-mail magazine reader 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:28.890
 And is it this band I am heading here to enter it, for example, if there are other heading 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.420
 You can do such a headline just by setting 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.620
 For example, it is easy to blow 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.890
 To 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:41.110
 You can do this kind of tape type or eco color 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:46.030
 As for the later magnificent this is 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 I'm say I guess is why table this It is that work of this kind of feeling is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:57.490
 Quad It is the bar high tea after Toka or set to get this rent 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:59.070
 Try making that voice into a sound form or something like that so easy to say 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.050
 doing 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.950
 8 videos can be embedded like this in a hurry on youtube hand yourself 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.619
 Toka or doing doing doing the iron reflected 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.080
 That's why it can be easily done 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.940
 Dropped an investment of this page is this saying on this eh O and here it is that it is the sound knobs 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.210
 Sometimes the hover window is displayed this way 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.730
 Please wait a moment it is say, whether you even say if I have changed here freely 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.930
 But it is by writing back here 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.120
 For example, I think that I do not need this Beige usually takes the highest speed every other day 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.090
 I can do it 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.209
 So this is very good 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.810
 By using that child's overwind 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.650
 What 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:44.720
 It is said that attracting customers really changes 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.370
 It's very effective It's an effective thing and this in the program is made by myself from scratch 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.590
 You can't do it quite well 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.910
 It is easy to get it You can easily paste and install just by setting the forewind 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.060
 So here it is 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.120
 It's a Zensai here and put in a form 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.470
 By putting the form in the hover window of this place 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:11.890
 That both things will be connected to attracting customers 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:16.390
 For example, I will introduce this example of the case I'm looking at this time after making something like this 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:22.510
 It's a movie, and this one also uses this lt template. 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:26.050
 After a this image like this You can embed it or something like this 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:33.050
 So this is the headline 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:36.530
 Isn't it blue? You can create various patterns instead of blue 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.740
 I'm going to go to the type of bottom or something like this notebook type 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:46.220
 It is a good voice for someone who won't die 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:50.250
 You will be able to choose a sheet with a obi attached or a sheet that has already been picked. 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.050
 I have you choose it, and I stun in the south station and the punch. 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.050
 Is it six kinds? 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:05.410
 Root six offers a color say Now this way also plans to increase the future looks more and more 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:10.090
 It can be easily done in the form, so there are six types of speech bubbles 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:16.000
 It's Hida City and it's supposed to do 6 rounds of tape . 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:20.620
 It feels like it's really easy to do that 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.150
 Unakanaka is not a way say template Moreover softening that net business Ten 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.740
 The plate is amazing 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.780
 That little school 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.280
 It tends to be like a business tic, but it's a pop that's easy to see if you say something else 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:39.250
 I am conscious of being able to make designs 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.740
 Customize in to this it is It is a background plant that child will of course go back in various form 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.729
 You can color it 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.479
 If you make this lp 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:52.009
 It is such a feeling that I can say 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:57.139
 I used this lp template and I said 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:05:01.999
 Strongest list up technique love it is the list I am employed here 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.750
 Since I can gather readers , I would like to work together if I put it by all means 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:07.760
 You it is 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.760
 Thank you very much
