okay and then you can just loosely split
your<00:00:50.960> hair<00:00:51.140> into<00:00:51.290> two<00:00:51.440> sections<00:00:51.700> you<00:00:52.700> don't

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
your hair into two sections you don't

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.990 
your hair into two sections you don't
need<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:54.220> use<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.250> comb<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:57.520> then<00:00:58.520> go<00:00:58.700> ahead<00:00:58.820> and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
need to use a comb and then go ahead and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.570 
need to use a comb and then go ahead and
create<00:00:59.450> two<00:01:00.140> basic<00:01:00.650> braids<00:01:00.890> on<00:01:01.070> each<00:01:01.310> side<00:01:01.550> of

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580

create two basic braids on each side of
your<00:01:01.700> head<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.930> just<00:01:03.140> split<00:01:04.040> each<00:01:04.190> side<00:01:04.460> into

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
your head so just split each side into

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.930 
your head so just split each side into
threes<00:01:05.089> three<00:01:05.690> pieces<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:12.310> braid<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.340> down

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
threes three pieces and braid it down

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.190 
threes three pieces and braid it down
and<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:16.340> like<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.820> leave<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.360> top<00:01:17.690> part<00:01:17.960> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
and I like to leave this top part a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.830 
and I like to leave this top part a
little<00:01:18.350> looser<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.160> I<00:01:19.460> also<00:01:19.700> don't<00:01:20.270> brush<00:01:20.600> my

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
little looser and I also don't brush my

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.260 
little looser and I also don't brush my
hair<00:01:20.869> before<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.470> start<00:01:21.800> because<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.160> prefer<00:01:23.090> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
hair before I start because I prefer a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.190 
hair before I start because I prefer a
messy<00:01:23.630> look<00:01:23.869> but<00:01:24.740> if<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:24.979> going<00:01:25.160> for<00:01:25.759> a

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
messy look but if you're going for a

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.719 
messy look but if you're going for a
smoother<00:01:27.200> braid<00:01:27.470> then<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.310> might<00:01:28.460> want<00:01:28.490> to

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
smoother braid then you might want to

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.910 
smoother braid then you might want to
brush<00:01:28.910> your<00:01:29.150> hair<00:01:29.210> out<00:01:29.470> before<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.590> start<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
brush your hair out before you start the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.290 
brush your hair out before you start the
braid<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:36.440> now<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.680> can<00:01:37.130> secure<00:01:37.880> your<00:01:38.000> braid

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
braid so now you can secure your braid

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:50.920 
braid so now you can secure your braid
with<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.570> clear<00:01:39.020> elastic<00:01:39.229> band<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:50.360> then<00:01:50.780> go

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
with a clear elastic band and then go

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:16.620 
with a clear elastic band and then go
ahead<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.200> do<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.560> same<00:01:51.800> thing<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.399> side

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.540 

and<00:02:17.280> secure<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:20.200> clear<00:02:20.500> elastic<00:02:21.010> band<00:02:21.250> again

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
and secure the clear elastic band again

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.330 
and secure the clear elastic band again
you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.720> use<00:02:22.750> whatever<00:02:23.200> kind<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.740> elastic<00:02:24.220> you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
you can use whatever kind of elastic you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can use whatever kind of elastic you
want<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.390> think<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.720> using<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.440> clear

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
want but I think that using a clear

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.700 
want but I think that using a clear
elastic<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.370> best<00:02:27.820> because<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:29.020> doesn't<00:02:29.500> show

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
elastic is best because it doesn't show

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:38.250 
elastic is best because it doesn't show
once<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.280> put<00:02:30.460> it<00:02:30.490> up<00:02:36.060> ok<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.660> now<00:02:37.810> before<00:02:38.170> we

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
once you put it up ok so now before we

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.020 
once you put it up ok so now before we
lay<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.920> braids<00:02:39.130> across<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.640> top<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.940> our

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
lay the braids across the top of our

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.540 
lay the braids across the top of our
head<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:40.990> go<00:02:41.110> ahead<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.470> pull<00:02:41.950> each<00:02:42.250> one

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
head just go ahead and pull each one

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.470 
head just go ahead and pull each one
apart<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:45.490> will<00:02:45.700> make<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.000> braid<00:02:46.240> look

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
apart this will make the braid look

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480 
apart this will make the braid look
thicker<00:02:46.810> when<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.560> laying<00:02:47.800> across<00:02:48.160> your

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
thicker when it's laying across your

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.480 
thicker when it's laying across your
head<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:50.050> again<00:02:50.440> if<00:02:50.740> you're<00:02:50.890> going<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.430> a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
head but again if you're going for a

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.960 
head but again if you're going for a
more<00:02:51.940> sleek<00:02:52.420> look<00:02:53.200> then<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.400> might<00:02:54.670> want<00:02:54.700> to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
more sleek look then you might want to

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:03.120 
more sleek look then you might want to
skip<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.360> step<00:02:59.760> ok<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.120> now<00:03:01.300> just<00:03:01.990> bring<00:03:02.800> each

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
skip this step ok so now just bring each

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.830 
skip this step ok so now just bring each
side<00:03:03.610> up<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.120> lay<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:05.290> across<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.860> top<00:03:06.310> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
side up and lay this across the top and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.570 
side up and lay this across the top and
using<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.930> few<00:03:08.140> bobby<00:03:08.410> pins<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:11.010> secure<00:03:12.010> in

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
using a few bobby pins just secure in

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.870 
using a few bobby pins just secure in
place<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:16.380> then<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.500> can<00:03:17.680> take<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.130> side

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
place and then you can take this side

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.180 
place and then you can take this side
and<00:03:19.210> lay<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.690> directly<00:03:20.290> over<00:03:20.770> those<00:03:20.920> bobby

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
and lay it directly over those bobby

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.050 
and lay it directly over those bobby
pins<00:03:21.490> so<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.910> they<00:03:22.000> don't<00:03:22.180> show<00:03:26.820> go<00:03:27.820> ahead

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
pins so that they don't show go ahead

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.210 
pins so that they don't show go ahead
and<00:03:28.210> turn<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.930> place<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:32.770> can<00:03:32.800> just

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
and turn this in place and you can just

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.150 
and turn this in place and you can just
tuck<00:03:33.550> this<00:03:33.970> piece<00:03:34.270> of<00:03:34.450> hair<00:03:34.660> underneath<00:03:35.160> this

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
tuck this piece of hair underneath this

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
tuck this piece of hair underneath this
first<00:03:36.580> break<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.750> can't<00:03:38.050> see<00:03:38.320> it

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.740 

okay<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.830> then<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.090> pull<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.570> few
