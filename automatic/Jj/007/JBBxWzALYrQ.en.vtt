00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
structure 18 so the Nike structure 18 is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.660 
structure 18 so the Nike structure 18 is
our<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> stability<00:00:19.710> shoe<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.520> most

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
our go to stability shoe and the most

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.640 
our go to stability shoe and the most
important<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> highlight<00:00:22.140> about<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
important thing to highlight about this

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.620 
important thing to highlight about this
update<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.150> most<00:00:24.330> stable

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
update is that it is the most stable

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470 
update is that it is the most stable
structure<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.590> we've<00:00:25.740> created<00:00:26.039> thus<00:00:26.490> far<00:00:26.519> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
structure that we've created thus far so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720 
structure that we've created thus far so
as<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.990> look<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> midsole<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.519> dual

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
as we look at the midsole we have a dual

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
as we look at the midsole we have a dual
density<00:00:29.910> system<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.720> where<00:00:30.900> we've<00:00:31.109> got<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
density system here where we've got a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.250 
density system here where we've got a
softer<00:00:31.920> cushion<00:00:32.279> foam<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.600> lateral<00:00:34.020> side

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
softer cushion foam on the lateral side

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.479 
softer cushion foam on the lateral side
of<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> midsole<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> give

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
of the midsole which is going to give

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
of the midsole which is going to give
you<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> nice<00:00:35.850> comfortable<00:00:36.239> ride<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.739> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the most medial side of the shoe we had

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.479 
the most medial side of the shoe we had
a<00:00:48.480> third<00:00:49.200> density<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> give

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
a third density which is going to give
