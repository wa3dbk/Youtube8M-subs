hands-off<00:05:41.230> approach<00:05:41.340> what<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:42.370> think<00:05:42.580> that's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
hands-off approach what I think that's

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.220 
hands-off approach what I think that's
that<00:05:43.000> that's<00:05:43.120> been<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.480> challenge<00:05:43.720> why<00:05:44.050> don't

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
that that's been the challenge why don't

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.440 
that that's been the challenge why don't
you<00:05:44.350> if<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.980> do<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.670> and<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.030> don't<00:05:46.240> have

you if you do that and you don't have
the<00:05:46.570> answer<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:46.930> think<00:05:47.170> you<00:05:47.380> look<00:05:47.530> even<00:05:47.620> more

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
the answer I think you look even more

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.440 
the answer I think you look even more
stupid<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:48.670> think<00:05:48.880> that's<00:05:49.060> part<00:05:49.270> of<00:05:49.360> the

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
stupid and I think that's part of the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.320 
extremely dangerous but you're right to
just<00:06:20.920> say<00:06:21.040> we<00:06:21.160> drop<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.490> ball<00:06:21.640> and<00:06:21.910> not<00:06:22.060> pick

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
just say we drop the ball and not pick

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.880 
just say we drop the ball and not pick
the<00:06:22.450> ball<00:06:22.570> back<00:06:22.750> up<00:06:22.930> again<00:06:23.170> is<00:06:23.380> very<00:06:23.500> very

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
the ball back up again is very very

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.680 
the ball back up again is very very
dangerous<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.400> step<00:06:24.790> two<00:06:24.940> of<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.120> process<00:06:25.510> of

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
dangerous and step two of the process of

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.870 
dangerous and step two of the process of
course<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:26.170> solve<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:27.010> problem<00:06:27.400> in<00:06:27.520> some<00:06:27.730> way

course to solve the problem in some way

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.490 
course to solve the problem in some way
and<00:06:28.090> that's<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.330> tylenol<00:06:28.900> solution<00:06:29.320> which<00:06:29.470> is

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
and that's the tylenol solution which is

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.950 
and that's the tylenol solution which is
you<00:06:29.860> know<00:06:29.890> yes<00:06:30.550> yes<00:06:31.240> we're<00:06:31.420> pulling<00:06:31.810> all<00:06:31.930> of
