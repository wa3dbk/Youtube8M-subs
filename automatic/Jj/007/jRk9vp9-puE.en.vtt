 with the economic and the environmental 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.980
 the social and the third pillar of the 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.510
 sustainable development in 2005 the law 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.270

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.250
 participation and citizenship of 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.260
 disabled people introduces a 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.570
 fundamental evolution in 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.250
 mentality 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.990
 I am disabled and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.840
 charge to society for me to be a 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.520
 ordinary citizen to compensate 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.410
 consequences of my disability 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.059
 and it's the same thing at school I'm 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.829
 a child I go to school 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.170
 do I need compensation 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.450
 to succeed my education here 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.280
 that's the question we ask ourselves 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.899
 now each department has 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.140
 of a departmental house of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.180
 disabled people mdph who prescribes 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.340
 in agreement with the family the situation 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.500
 most suitable for the child as 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.739
 reception in an ordinary environment with a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.800
 auxiliary school life a avs here at 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.829
 the school van der vis of nice one listens 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.409
 the cases it's been 20 years since that's in 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.469
 school and it's only been five years 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.079
 we welcome children who have 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.630
 problems and with follow up with a 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:31.490
 assistant of school life like him if 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:33.459
 this year I had been told gathering 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.950
 Christian is a student who has troubles 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:38.840
 an autistic disorder adidas father heart 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.909
 so it's a child who has a hard time getting 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 focus already so with respect to the 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.170
 language so to the children of the class 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.609
 may have several 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.499
 information from both the mistress 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.149
 this is not the case of christian than that 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.369
 needs to be retranscribed 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.919
 conlure u10 instructions but a 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.450
 records at once nine times this this 

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:01.340
 new times 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.989
 how much does it make my goal is to pass 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.579
 more time with christian because 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.439
 what the masters did not read elected 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.999
 does not do what the 28 command to a 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.709
 times thirty children in the place she 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.560
 would like but she can not do it 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.209
 not what he is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.099
 the tension needs the attention of the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.290
 twelve other students in the class 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.660
 my role is next to the mistress 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.700
 but nothing I do not do anything without the agreement 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.780
 of the teacher I have my relationship with 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.430
 lucien because I am at 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.709
 daily 'but to the relationship if with 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.209
 the other students in the class that's who 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.800
 is also very important because 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.209
 that I have to be accepted by 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.470
 christian but I must also be 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.120
 accepted by the whole class 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.640
 what do you prefer in school in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.730
 the subjects she gives the teacher 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.000
 Well, what are the materials the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 maths the french sciences blackcurrant 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.580
 my mac 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.580
 yes and what do you like the least 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:54.239
 what you do not like 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.250
 assessments i am completely 0 yes 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.769
 you are completely at zero because I have 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.209
 hard to concentrate 1 because when 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.830
 there is too much noise around you 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.239
 trouble concentrating you that's why 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.709
 you do not arrive with the faults that 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.970
 I did just now where he but hey 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.370
 we will do better the mistress she said 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.549
 we would do it at the ural 1 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.820
 florian you can read the last problem 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:18.030
 it's very well done it's very good 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.060
 will let it finish now in the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.579
 department of alpes-maritimes there is 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.500
 1400 prescription that is to say it is the 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.090
 pollution of right to autonomy which 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.799
 prescribes the avs and charges to 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.290
 national education 2 but all in them 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.090
 so it's more than 1400 prescription 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.859
 today what represents 800 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.739
 personal and we will do it in the center 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.329
 Arabic for the 1400 prescription na 30 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.160
 children who are not accompanying the 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.510
 obstacle course parents is 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.380
 what they describe one is beyond the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.250
 budgetary issues 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.410
 they often have the impression 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.690
 actually it takes all the time 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.579
 sometimes fight again to fight for 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.799
 go to school it should not be more royal 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.650
 pleaded the crisis picture 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.060
 holder of the bachelor's degree at least 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.889
 auxiliary school life are 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.200
 Interviewed by the electorate 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.780
 even before their training course 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.100
 and if since the beginning of the school year 2013 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.560
 some contracts can become c 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.850
 m most are in precarious employment on 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.480
 the feels there these are contracts 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.450
 provisional 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.180
 so I take advantage of the camera to launch 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.870
 still an appeal to our dear powers 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.970
 public 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.710
 here is to look a little bit on the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.240
 work of avs because the beautiful is 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.420
 still important are children 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.950
 that we need to insert in 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.450
 national education in society 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.040
 children as to the captain of 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.690
 atypical courses but as I 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.250
 repeats at the beginning of the year there are some 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.930
 hang glasses there are big there 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.790
 there are some blondes ago there are some 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.920
 browns and but everyone is a being 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.420
 human so here we live together 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.790
 I think it helps kids 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.240
 to be more tolerant to respect the 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.400
 other 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.310
 whatever the problems that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.680
 can have where the differences I like 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.930
 well the video games to go through in my 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.300
 agree a detail of the coordinates a 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.840
 commentary go to the website of 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.840
 priority
