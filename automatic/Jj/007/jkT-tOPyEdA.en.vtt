00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the region actually came from mining so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
the region actually came from mining so

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
of gold and you I the basic question is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.390 
of gold and you I the basic question is
really<00:03:35.770> who<00:03:36.010> aims<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.850> profit<00:03:37.360> at<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.690> end

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
really who aims to profit at the end

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.250 
really who aims to profit at the end
well<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.780> understand<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.170> the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
well you have to understand that the

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.699 
well you have to understand that the
project<00:03:41.590> Romania<00:03:42.130> knows<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:43.440> deal<00:03:44.440> between

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
project Romania knows the deal between

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.710 
project Romania knows the deal between
the<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.580> Canadian<00:03:45.850> company<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.600> the

know exactly what are the terms of the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.490 
know exactly what are the terms of the
understanding<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:54.330> Romania<00:03:55.330> wins<00:03:55.750> way<00:03:56.440> too

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
understanding but Romania wins way too

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.949 
understanding but Romania wins way too
little<00:03:56.860> from<00:03:57.280> from<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:57.880> project<00:03:58.150> especially

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
little from from this project especially

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.920 
little from from this project especially
because<00:03:59.430> there's<00:04:00.430> only<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.760> mining<00:04:01.180> tax<00:04:01.420> tax

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
because there's only a mining tax tax

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.720 
because there's only a mining tax tax
that<00:04:02.140> has<00:04:02.290> been<00:04:02.500> recently<00:04:03.630> grown<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.780> 6%<00:04:05.170> and

for this company which in a way it is a

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.490 
for this company which in a way it is a
very<00:07:15.400> bad<00:07:15.640> view<00:07:16.360> because<00:07:16.750> Romania<00:07:17.110> has<00:07:17.290> had

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500

bad experience defining accidents and

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.250 
bad experience defining accidents and
