pictures all right the first picture

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.170 
pictures all right the first picture
looks<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.989> outside<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.560> map<00:02:13.180> looks

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
looks like the outside of the map looks

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.740 
looks like the outside of the map looks
like<00:02:14.330> there's<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:16.870> anti-gravity<00:02:17.870> bridge<00:02:18.470> thing

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
like there's a anti-gravity bridge thing

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.930 
like there's a anti-gravity bridge thing
you<00:02:20.750> like<00:02:20.900> jump<00:02:21.230> off<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.489> your<00:02:22.640> float

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
you like jump off and like your float

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.539 
you like jump off and like your float
and<00:02:23.209> go<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.600> other<00:02:23.630> side<00:02:23.989> from<00:02:24.980> probably

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
and go to the other side from probably

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.250 
and go to the other side from probably
wrong<00:02:26.030> about<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:28.480> yeah<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:30.019> looks<00:02:30.200> pretty

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
wrong about that yeah it looks pretty

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.229 
wrong about that yeah it looks pretty
cool<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.709> guess<00:02:30.769> there's<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:31.370> crane<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
cool I guess there's like crane in the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.240 
cool I guess there's like crane in the
background<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.910> looks<00:02:35.090> pretty<00:02:35.209> cool<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:37.040> then

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
background it looks pretty cool and then

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.430 
background it looks pretty cool and then
doesn't<00:02:37.820> really<00:02:38.299> much<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.600> speculate<00:02:39.260> here

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
doesn't really much to speculate here

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.600 
doesn't really much to speculate here
but<00:02:40.720> okay<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.010> next<00:02:43.160> question

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
but okay on the next question

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.040 
but okay on the next question
this<00:02:45.240> looks<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.720> hallway<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.440> enter<00:02:46.770> from

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
this looks like a hallway you enter from

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.570 
this looks like a hallway you enter from
look<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.200> your<00:02:49.320> left<00:02:50.360> um<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:52.010> rock<00:02:53.010> room<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.520> don't

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
look on your left um a rock room I don't

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.690 
look on your left um a rock room I don't
know<00:02:54.230> somewhere<00:02:55.230> rocky<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:56.000> guess<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.240> looks

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
know somewhere rocky I guess it looks

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.210 
know somewhere rocky I guess it looks
like<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.790> elevator<00:03:00.270> over<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:01.620> uh<00:03:04.220> yeah

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
like a elevator over there but uh yeah

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
new gun all right the new gun so this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.410 
new gun all right the new gun so this
gun<00:03:24.150> looks<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.260> weird<00:03:26.420> from

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
gun looks really really weird from

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.500 
gun looks really really weird from
according<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> website<00:03:30.620> black<00:03:31.620> ops<00:03:32.510> hold

says<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:46.060> wave<00:03:46.240> gun<00:03:47.099> capable<00:03:48.099> of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
says it's the wave gun capable of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.780 
says it's the wave gun capable of
cooking<00:03:48.790> zombies<00:03:49.450> from<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> inside<00:03:50.319> out

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
cooking zombies from the inside out

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.520 
cooking zombies from the inside out
which<00:03:51.790> sounds<00:03:52.060> pretty<00:03:52.540> freaking<00:03:53.410> amazing<00:03:53.680> ah

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
which sounds pretty freaking amazing ah

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.400 
which sounds pretty freaking amazing ah
it<00:03:56.530> looks<00:03:56.770> like<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> wheel<00:03:58.900> did<00:03:59.200> I<00:04:00.060> think

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
it looks like to a wheel did I think

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.199 
it looks like to a wheel did I think
like<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.560> shoot<00:04:02.770> one<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:03.400> shoot<00:04:03.610> once<00:04:03.850> and

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
like you shoot one you shoot once and

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.000 
like you shoot one you shoot once and
then<00:04:04.420> shoot<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.690> another<00:04:04.900> time<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.770> should

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
then shoot it another time you should

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.979 
then shoot it another time you should
punch<00:04:06.220> with<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.520> blue<00:04:06.730> one<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.060> once<00:04:07.840> with

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
punch with the blue one and once with

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.420 
punch with the blue one and once with
the<00:04:08.050> red<00:04:08.290> one<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.650> think<00:04:08.950> that's<00:04:09.130> how<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.340> works

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
the red one I think that's how it works

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.890 
the red one I think that's how it works
or<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.300> could<00:04:11.050> be<00:04:11.080> do<00:04:11.380> really<00:04:11.830> or<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:13.569> can<00:04:13.720> have

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
or it could be do really or you can have

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.710 
or it could be do really or you can have
one<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.950> your<00:04:15.069> partner<00:04:15.580> can<00:04:15.730> happen<00:04:16.060> that

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
one and your partner can happen that

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.400 
one and your partner can happen that
would<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:17.079> amazing<00:04:17.290> if<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.760> your<00:04:18.850> partner

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
would be amazing if you and your partner

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.460 
would be amazing if you and your partner
can<00:04:20.410> both<00:04:20.739> carry<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.400> one<00:04:21.609> or<00:04:21.729> weapon<00:04:22.060> or<00:04:22.780> you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
can both carry that one or weapon or you

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.200 
can both carry that one or weapon or you
can<00:04:23.590> attach<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.040> together<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.520> use<00:04:24.639> it<00:04:24.820> that

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
can attach it together and use it that

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.150 
can attach it together and use it that
will<00:04:25.360> be<00:04:25.510> amazing<00:04:25.720> that's<00:04:26.320> what<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> would<00:04:26.860> love

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
will be amazing that's what I would love

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.719 
will be amazing that's what I would love
that<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.850> right<00:04:28.030> guys<00:04:28.300> look<00:04:28.510> good<00:04:28.660> back<00:04:29.729> but

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
that it's right guys look good back but

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.409 
that it's right guys look good back but
yeah<00:04:31.200> speculations<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:33.490> looks<00:04:33.790> like

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
yeah speculations on and it looks like

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.900 
yeah speculations on and it looks like
that<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:34.930> looks<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.860> ray<00:04:36.160> gun<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.729> blue

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
that it looks like a ray gun the blue

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.560 
that it looks like a ray gun the blue
one<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:41.100> yeah<00:04:42.100> i<00:04:42.130> know<00:04:42.610> i<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:42.910> get<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.389> use<00:04:43.540> it

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
one and yeah i know i can get to use it

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.659 
one and yeah i know i can get to use it
something<00:04:43.930> i<00:04:43.990> like<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:45.040> shoot<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.400> ball

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
something i like you shoot the ball

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.430 
something i like you shoot the ball
first<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.270> then<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.600> red<00:04:46.840> one<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.169> think

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
first and then the red one I think

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.960 
first and then the red one I think
that's<00:04:47.560> how<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.770> works<00:04:47.830> or<00:04:48.220> could<00:04:48.789> be<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
that's how it works or could be the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.330 
that's how it works or could be the
opposite<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:52.050> I'm<00:04:53.050> not<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:53.380> sure<00:04:53.410> cuz<00:04:54.130> then

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
opposite but I'm not so sure cuz then

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.200 
opposite but I'm not so sure cuz then
that<00:04:54.370> backs<00:04:54.669> not<00:04:54.820> out<00:04:54.970> yet<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:57.030> tell<00:04:58.030> me<00:04:58.120> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
that backs not out yet and tell me the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.760 
that backs not out yet and tell me the
comments<00:04:58.600> what<00:04:58.750> do<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:58.900> think<00:04:59.140> about<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.740> new

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
comments what do you think about the new

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.760 
comments what do you think about the new
gun<00:05:00.039> and

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
gun and

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.999 
gun and
yeah<00:05:02.840> wave<00:05:03.840> gun<00:05:04.199> for<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> one<00:05:05.039> I<00:05:05.069> guess<00:05:05.990> yeah

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.029 

this<00:05:11.030> this<00:05:12.030> picture<00:05:12.479> has<00:05:12.750> me<00:05:12.930> really<00:05:13.349> confused

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
this this picture has me really confused

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.159 
this this picture has me really confused
I<00:05:14.610> do<00:05:15.180> not<00:05:15.629> know<00:05:15.870> what<00:05:15.990> this<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.580> another<00:05:17.580> name

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
I do not know what this is another name

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.089 
I do not know what this is another name
all<00:05:19.169> right<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:19.979> called<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:21.389> quantum

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
all right it's called the quantum

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.800 
all right it's called the quantum
entanglement<00:05:23.099> device<00:05:23.129> which<00:05:24.090> taps<00:05:24.389> into<00:05:24.690> the

quantum<00:05:32.970> mechanics<00:05:33.569> I<00:05:33.720> really<00:05:34.229> don't<00:05:34.349> know

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
quantum mechanics I really don't know

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.430 
quantum mechanics I really don't know
what<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.620> is<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:35.130> really<00:05:35.970> don't<00:05:36.090> but<00:05:36.780> I'm

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
what that is I really don't but I'm

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.020 
what that is I really don't but I'm
gonna<00:05:37.650> research<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.310> make<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:40.729> update<00:05:41.729> this

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
gonna research and make and update this

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.990 
gonna research and make and update this
weapon<00:05:42.569> and<00:05:42.750> out<00:05:43.099> thorn<00:05:44.099> I'll<00:05:44.340> just<00:05:44.610> research

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
weapon and out thorn I'll just research

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.749 
weapon and out thorn I'll just research
it<00:05:45.740> because<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:46.830> know<00:05:46.889> there's<00:05:47.250> something<00:05:47.460> to

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
it because I know there's something to

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.189 
it because I know there's something to
this<00:05:47.909> I<00:05:48.210> think<00:05:48.810> if<00:05:48.960> you<00:05:49.080> use<00:05:49.229> it<00:05:49.789> either<00:05:50.789> get<00:05:51.090> it

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
this I think if you use it either get it

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.189 
this I think if you use it either get it
quite<00:05:52.199> easy<00:05:52.949> against<00:05:53.400> fighting<00:05:53.729> zombies<00:05:54.199> or

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
quite easy against fighting zombies or

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.830 
quite easy against fighting zombies or
harder<00:05:56.099> to<00:05:56.849> fight<00:05:57.030> against<00:05:57.330> armies<00:05:57.659> because

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
harder to fight against armies because

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.290 
harder to fight against armies because
it<00:05:57.960> says<00:05:58.169> to<00:05:58.889> bless<00:05:59.130> or<00:05:59.430> curse<00:05:59.460> so<00:05:59.940> that's<00:06:00.150> what

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
it says to bless or curse so that's what

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.649 
it says to bless or curse so that's what
I<00:06:00.330> think<00:06:01.250> yeah<00:06:02.250> someone<00:06:03.030> to<00:06:03.090> think<00:06:03.210> about<00:06:03.479> them

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
I think yeah someone to think about them

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.309 
I think yeah someone to think about them
this<00:06:04.500> quantum<00:06:05.129> entanglement<00:06:05.729> device<00:06:05.759> good

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
this quantum entanglement device good

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.270 
this quantum entanglement device good
QED<00:06:07.319> or<00:06:08.159> short

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.540
