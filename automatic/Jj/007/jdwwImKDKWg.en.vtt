00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Now tempted by the pure white scenery 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.720
 I am heading to the unknown world. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.840
 Traveling under a grey sky like a lost person 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.260
 Every day, the new map is infiltrated with a little bit of dreams. 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.420
 One day, I will take steps too small. 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.440
 Towards the other side of the cloud 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.180
 The scars caused by stubbornness are like penetrating the mind 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 Falling raindrops repeatedly make irregular reflections 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.040
 Direct light rays cross each other 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.020
 Do not tell the direction of the first move, no matter where you go 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 Branding a thin afterimage in both eyes 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.880
 Communicate to the unknown world 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.480
 Unconsciously attached black and white labels 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 Concealing our important things 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.780
 It’s more beautiful than a beautiful stone than a star. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.740
 Holograms in the name of "dreams" make people noisy 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.540
 Towards the scenery beyond the time and space and not knowing when to draw 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.340
 The regret and loneliness now fly like a bubble. 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.480
 The road to go straight will encounter setbacks 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.780
 But after the scars fall automatically, I must be stronger than now. 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.380
 Now tempted by the pure white scenery 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.140
 I am heading to the unknown world. 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.920
 The rainbow of light appears in the sky before the sunset 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:00.120
 Communicate the voice I shouted to the shadow of tomorrow’s tremor 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:13.640
 The light under direct light spreads out from each other 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:25.660
 Infused with afternoon showers 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.060
 Countless shades will now be mixed together 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.700
 No matter where you are in this world 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.560
 Will definitely reach the unknown world
