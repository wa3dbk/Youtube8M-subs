 in search of the perfect body 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.889
 Many young people have fallen vigorexia 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.939
 a new eating disorder of the new century let us listen to the words of a 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.009
 expert 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:35.179
 what happens is a league the day that you beat many people who cross not 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.139
 and that because because they prepare themselves and do not have a good 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.629
 orientation and that's what happens with many athletes who prepare themselves and in 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.779
 the last stage and cousins ​​aunts not only for a competition to for 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.789
 looking good 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:53.189
 In the end, as the diet is stressful, they lose the conflict and the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.299
 strategy 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.430
 and that's why many people 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.309
 that comes to the mirror 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.579
 and you suddenly see what is not there is no case of the charity dinner you see 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.919
 fat but if someone saves her they say she's too skinny and and that's something 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.539
 what 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:12.869
 that many people are affected by it, that it is always good to have a person who 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.769
 is to the rival tulio advise 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.109

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.189
 ideal is to have a good coach to help you

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.169
 a routine

 do things seriously and get an orientation 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.279
