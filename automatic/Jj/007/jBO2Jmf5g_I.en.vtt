00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.790
 educational an education site number 1 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.069
 of Latin America was personal then 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.360
 Let's continue here with the videos of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.450
 math right 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.880
 with Multiplication Video 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.699
 I wanted to show you now how it is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.359
 which makes a one multiplication account 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:28.080
 with the number a bit more complex 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 Let's see here two hundred and four times 5 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.880
 the first thing we'll do is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.110
 put 204 just like we did in addition 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.559
 and subtraction 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 We'll put the 204 on top of the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 five 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.070
 and then we did the same in the edition 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.170
 there is no explanation and inflation 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:01.699
 we are going to divide into columns here is the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:09.270
 column of the unit here in column ten 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:11.670
 and here the column is a hundred in fact 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.280
 so let's go the first thing that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.130
 Guys are going to do is in the unit column 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 we will multiply 5 by four 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 take five times four or four times 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.020
 five can clearly do so five 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.880
 times four I'm going to do five more 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.680
 five plus five plus five in I did 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 four times 15 any answer 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.180
 twenty - five plus five in five years to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.700
 people want to make four can also 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.990
 be four plus four plus four more 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.860
 How many more will be equal to 2020? 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.740
 so we'll see that 20 has two 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.340
 drive discs edit dozen 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:12.289
 here we will put the zero of the unit 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.289
 and 2 in 10 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.680
 the ca in the dozen column just fine now 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:31.160
 Let's move on to the next one. 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:36.760
 account is five times and zero to 50 has a 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 We have a strategy here to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.690
 50 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:48.710
 Let's see who has already noticed 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:54.710
 look at 0 but say more 00 + 0 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:03:01.610
 is equal to zero then 50 equals zero 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:07.010
 in fact personal any number x 0 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:11.180
 is equal to zero, we do 312 times the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.200
 number 01 to do but is more r 312 times to 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:23.870
 people will see the result this year 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:26.180
 then any number 1 x 0 to 0 much 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:32.030
 well then let's see that we will continue 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:36.680
 our account here right 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:41.510
 our quanta 50 is equal to zero 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.790
 but here in the dozens column see the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.489
 that there are 12 that we have to do with 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.350
 the creditors we will add the sum 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:56.180
 to this result 0 plus two equals 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.670
 The 2 writes down here in the column is 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:06.610
 and is now missing for the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:13.310
 people only five times 2 or 2 times 5 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.440
 is equal to 10 has any number over 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.209
 two do not have a number two seconds 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.539
 so we do not have any numbers 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.690
 also left two or because otherwise 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.690
 we had to keep the account does not 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.600
 has no number 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.790
 and then the end is over we 'll go 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:37.170
 We will put the result 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:44.450
 here in total and we will see that 204 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.450
 result 51 result is 1020 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.630
 recommends the following 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.630
 videos to continue learning
