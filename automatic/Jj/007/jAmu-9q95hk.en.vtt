hop hip hop culture it used to be them

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.120 
hop hip hop culture it used to be them
has<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.700> people's<00:04:14.420> expression<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:15.800> used<00:04:16.040> to

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
has the people's expression it used to
