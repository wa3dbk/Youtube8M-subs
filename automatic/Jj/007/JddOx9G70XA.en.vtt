00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
alright today we're going to look at how

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.440 
alright today we're going to look at how
to<00:00:03.780> do<00:00:04.790> object<00:00:05.810> baked<00:00:06.810> um<00:00:07.849> we<00:00:08.849> could<00:00:09.030> start<00:00:09.300> off

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
to do object baked um we could start off

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.770 
to do object baked um we could start off
with<00:00:09.690> picking<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.440> cube<00:00:11.000> doesn't<00:00:12.000> matter<00:00:12.179> where

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
with picking a cube doesn't matter where

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.890 
with picking a cube doesn't matter where
you<00:00:12.929> place<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.519> you<00:00:14.519> could<00:00:14.730> add<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> texture

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
you place it you could add a texture

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.050 
you place it you could add a texture
like<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:17.160> white<00:00:17.900> texture<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.340> apply<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
like a white texture and apply it to the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.099 
like a white texture and apply it to the
object<00:00:21.740> that's<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.039> cube<00:00:23.689> you<00:00:24.689> could<00:00:24.869> click

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
object that's a cube you could click

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.560 
object that's a cube you could click
render<00:00:25.859> big<00:00:26.609> object<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.189> would<00:00:29.189> prefer

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
render big object I would prefer

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.330 
render big object I would prefer

if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.739> want<00:00:55.920> full<00:00:56.160> resolution<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
if you want full resolution you want to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.900 
if you want full resolution you want to
go<00:00:57.390> 10<00:00:58.020> 24<00:00:59.090> but<00:01:00.090> we'll<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.390> keep<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
go 10 24 but we'll just keep it at that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.840 
go 10 24 but we'll just keep it at that
if<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.120> bake<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.899> these<00:01:04.080> uh<00:01:04.140> these<00:01:04.850> six

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
if we bake it we get these uh these six

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.170 
if we bake it we get these uh these six
six<00:01:06.330> cubes<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:10.860> could<00:01:11.100> jump<00:01:11.460> into<00:01:11.729> paint<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
six cubes we could jump into paint and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.170 
six cubes we could jump into paint and
click<00:01:15.180> where<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.479> export<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:17.460> open<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
click where we export it we open it and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
click where we export it we open it and
we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.020> six<00:01:19.590> cubes<00:01:21.020> let's<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.110> number

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
we have the six cubes let's just number

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.770 
we have the six cubes let's just number
and<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:22.979> our<00:01:23.340> first<00:01:24.350> second<00:01:25.350> third

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
and this is our first second third

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.569 
and this is our first second third
fourth<00:01:27.780> fifth<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.070> sixth<00:01:29.970> cube<00:01:30.710> we<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.890> save

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
fourth fifth and sixth cube we go save

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.260 
fourth fifth and sixth cube we go save
it<00:01:32.700> again<00:01:32.810> jump<00:01:33.810> back<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.229> cinema<00:01:34.650> 4d<00:01:35.390> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
it again jump back into cinema 4d and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
it again jump back into cinema 4d and
open<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.390> our<00:01:39.600> saved<00:01:40.259> cube<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.729> drag<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> back

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
open up our saved cube and drag it back

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.200 
open up our saved cube and drag it back
right<00:01:42.509> into<00:01:42.990> there

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.010 

actually<00:01:48.210> let's<00:01:48.420> rename<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.940> like<00:01:51.020> color

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually let's rename this to like color

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually let's rename this to like color
one<00:01:52.970> just<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> difference<00:01:54.690> pop<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.740> back

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
one just for the difference pop it back

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.910 
one just for the difference pop it back
into<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.050> we<00:01:58.050> have<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.320> numbered<00:01:58.650> we

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
into here and we have it numbered we

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
into here and we have it numbered we
could<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.310> apply<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.730> to<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> cube<00:02:00.930> right

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
could just apply it to this cube right

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.050 
could just apply it to this cube right
here<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:07.770> could<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:07.950> how<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.430> affected

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
here and we could see how it affected

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.960 
here and we could see how it affected
the<00:02:09.420> entire<00:02:09.450> cube<00:02:10.290> how<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:10.920> number<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.580> guys

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the entire cube how we number you guys

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.940 
the entire cube how we number you guys
could<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.450> way<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.590> with

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
could do it way more not just with

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.350 
could do it way more not just with
numbers<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.520> could<00:02:14.640> add<00:02:14.820> your<00:02:15.030> own<00:02:15.060> like

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
numbers you could add your own like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.510 
numbers you could add your own like
logos<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:16.200> whatever<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.220> could

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
logos or whatever you want and you could

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.070 
logos or whatever you want and you could
not<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> cube<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> could<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> curse

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
not just be a cube it could be a curse

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.700 
not just be a cube it could be a curse
fear<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.740> any<00:02:20.370> other<00:02:20.700> sort<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.480> object<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.440> we

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
fear or any other sort of object like we

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.610 
fear or any other sort of object like we
could<00:02:22.860> possibly<00:02:23.250> even<00:02:23.370> try<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> sphere

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
could possibly even try it with a sphere

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.340 
could possibly even try it with a sphere
pop<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.830> onto<00:02:25.950> their<00:02:27.620> baked<00:02:28.620> object<00:02:30.350> sure

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
pop it onto their baked object sure

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.350 
pop it onto their baked object sure
would<00:02:31.560> keep<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.950> at<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.430> there<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.000> go<00:02:33.030> we

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
would keep it at that and there we go we

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.770 
would keep it at that and there we go we
have<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:33.690> these<00:02:34.250> now<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.310> jump<00:02:35.850> back<00:02:36.090> into<00:02:36.390> our

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
have all these now we jump back into our

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.700 
have all these now we jump back into our
file<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:40.560> we

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
file and we have this this is what we

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.900 
file and we have this this is what we
