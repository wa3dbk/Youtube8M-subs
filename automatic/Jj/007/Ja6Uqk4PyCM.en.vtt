robot guitar hi Rebecca yeah this is the

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.540 
robot guitar hi Rebecca yeah this is the
guitar<00:00:22.990> that<00:00:23.140> has<00:00:23.199> the<00:00:23.560> robot<00:00:23.949> tuning<00:00:24.340> system

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
guitar that has the robot tuning system

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.880 
guitar that has the robot tuning system
on<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:25.060> and<00:00:25.270> actually<00:00:25.690> after<00:00:26.260> market<00:00:26.590> system

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
on it and actually after market system

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.550 
on it and actually after market system
is<00:00:26.980> going<00:00:27.039> to<00:00:27.160> be<00:00:27.250> available<00:00:28.050> sometime<00:00:29.050> in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
is going to be available sometime in

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.159 
is going to be available sometime in
June<00:00:29.859> and<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:30.820> be<00:00:31.090> able<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.390> retrofit<00:00:31.810> some

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
June and so be able to retrofit some

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.739 
June and so be able to retrofit some
consumers<00:00:33.089> basically<00:00:34.089> the<00:00:34.179> way<00:00:34.300> this<00:00:34.479> works

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:34.749 
consumers basically the way this works

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.860 
consumers basically the way this works
is<00:00:35.019> that<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.260> have<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.469> processor<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.870> you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
is that you have a processor and you

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.419 
is that you have a processor and you
have<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.079> push-pull<00:00:38.649> knob<00:00:38.829> that<00:00:39.039> works<00:00:39.219> like<00:00:39.399> a

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
have a push-pull knob that works like a

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.259 
have a push-pull knob that works like a
mouse<00:00:40.019> so<00:00:41.019> we'll<00:00:41.769> say<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.280> it's<00:00:42.850> already<00:00:43.149> in

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
mouse so we'll say that it's already in

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.849 
mouse so we'll say that it's already in
standard<00:00:43.449> tuning<00:00:43.659> but<00:00:44.199> we'll<00:00:44.350> say<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:44.589> want

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
standard tuning but we'll say you want

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.979 
standard tuning but we'll say you want
to<00:00:44.949> play<00:00:45.159> something<00:00:45.850> an<00:00:46.030> opening<00:00:46.389> like<00:00:46.420> Black

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
to play something an opening like Black

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.770 
to play something an opening like Black
Crowes<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.399> you'll<00:00:48.549> actually<00:00:48.729> turn<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.449> dial

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
Crowes so you'll actually turn this dial

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.379 
Crowes so you'll actually turn this dial
until<00:00:50.199> you<00:00:51.100> get<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.519> Blooey<00:00:51.819> and<00:00:52.269> then

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
until you get to the Blooey and then

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.340 
until you get to the Blooey and then
push<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.690> center<00:00:53.319> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.989> strum<00:00:56.319> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
push the center and then you strum the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.039 
push the center and then you strum the
guitar<00:00:56.469> when<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.100> strum<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.399> guitar<00:00:58.049> it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
guitar when you strum the guitar it

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.559 
guitar when you strum the guitar it
sends<00:00:59.619> the<00:00:59.679> signal<00:01:00.219> up<00:01:00.369> to<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.699> machine<00:01:01.299> heads

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
sends the signal up to the machine heads

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.329 
sends the signal up to the machine heads
and<00:01:01.780> actually<00:01:02.199> tunes<00:01:02.469> it<00:01:02.649> for<00:01:02.889> you<00:01:03.039> know<00:01:03.219> this

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
and actually tunes it for you know this

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.640 
and actually tunes it for you know this
is<00:01:03.399> going<00:01:03.609> to<00:01:03.760> an<00:01:03.879> alternate<00:01:04.300> tuning<00:01:04.690> so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
is going to an alternate tuning so

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.350 
is going to an alternate tuning so
there's<00:01:05.830> seven<00:01:06.190> preset<00:01:06.670> tunings<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.240> this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
there's seven preset tunings in this

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.050 
there's seven preset tunings in this
guitar<00:01:07.720> as<00:01:08.200> standard<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.100> then<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.310> has<00:01:09.490> open

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
guitar as standard and then it has open

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.520 
guitar as standard and then it has open

blues tuning which is what Keith
Richards<00:01:16.030> uses<00:01:16.480> a<00:01:16.510> lot<00:01:17.280> half-step<00:01:18.280> down

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
Richards uses a lot half-step down

those all comes presets the six presets

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200 
those all comes presets the six presets
other<00:01:27.040> than<00:01:27.250> standard<00:01:27.640> tuning<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:28.060> can

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
other than standard tuning you can

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.580 
other than standard tuning you can
actually<00:01:28.360> reprogram<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:29.320> if<00:01:29.410> there's

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
actually reprogram so if there's

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually reprogram so if there's
something<00:01:29.800> that<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.610> play<00:01:30.940> but<00:01:31.330> you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
something that you that you play but you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.850 
something that you that you play but you
don't<00:01:31.720> use<00:01:31.900> something<00:01:32.290> other<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.680> can

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
don't use something other you can

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.190 
don't use something other you can
actually<00:01:33.010> substitute<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.880> for<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.050> now

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
actually substitute that for it so now

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:46.920 
actually substitute that for it so now
you're<00:01:35.350> an<00:01:35.440> opening

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.740 

so<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.620> have<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.250> ability<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.120> hear<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
so you have that ability to hear the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.960 
so you have that ability to hear the
different<00:01:50.110> tunings<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.650> then<00:01:51.400> in<00:01:51.550> about<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
different tunings and then in about the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.600 
different tunings and then in about the
amount<00:01:52.120> of<00:01:52.270> time<00:01:52.480> that<00:01:52.510> it<00:01:52.750> takes<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:54.370> say

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
amount of time that it takes you to say

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.780 
amount of time that it takes you to say
thank<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:55.480> here's<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.290> next<00:01:56.440> song<00:01:56.800> you

LED and that led is there for one
purpose<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.240> one<00:02:10.330> purpose<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.899> holy<00:02:11.110> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
purpose and one purpose is holy and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.610 
purpose and one purpose is holy and
that's<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.750> drummer<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> everybody

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that's so that the drummer and everybody

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.680 
that's so that the drummer and everybody
else<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> band<00:02:15.310> as<00:02:15.820> long<00:02:16.060> as<00:02:16.209> they<00:02:16.330> can<00:02:16.510> see

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
else in the band as long as they can see

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.720 
else in the band as long as they can see
a<00:02:16.720> light<00:02:16.990> there<00:02:17.320> knows<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.190> guitar<00:02:18.459> players

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
a light there knows the guitar players

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.050 
a light there knows the guitar players
not<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.120> tune<00:02:19.360> don't<00:02:19.959> start<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.950> song<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.730> so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
not in tune don't start the song and so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.120 
not in tune don't start the song and so
you<00:02:25.120> also<00:02:25.360> hurt<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.170> wallets<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.709> tuning

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
you also hurt to the wallets in tuning

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.240 
you also hurt to the wallets in tuning
mode<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:28.120> cuts<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.140> signal<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.100> signal

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
mode it cuts the the signal the signal

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
mode it cuts the the signal the signal
out<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.150> don't<00:02:31.330> hear<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.510> cranking

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
out so that you don't hear it cranking

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.920 
out so that you don't hear it cranking
around<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:34.120> keith

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
around so now you have the keith

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
around so now you have the keith
richards<00:02:35.200> thing

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.070 

so<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.520> as<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.030> sound<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.690> he<00:02:42.930> has

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
so you as that as that sound that he has

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.040 
so you as that as that sound that he has
and<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.210> said<00:02:45.390> all<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.960> do

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and then like I said all you have to do

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.140 
and then like I said all you have to do
is<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.350> pull<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.710> straight<00:02:46.830> out<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.490> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
is just pull it straight out and it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.830 
is just pull it straight out and it
defaults<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.810> stand<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.710> tune<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.810> back

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
defaults to stand in tune so you go back

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.730 
defaults to stand in tune so you go back
to<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.320> now<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.430> weren't<00:02:53.610> enough<00:02:54.740> if

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
to that now if that weren't enough if

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.100 
to that now if that weren't enough if
that<00:02:56.010> weren't<00:02:56.220> enough<00:02:56.780> one<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.960> other

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that weren't enough one of the other

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.880 
that weren't enough one of the other
things<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.100> with<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.890> will

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
things you can do with this is that will

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.860 
things you can do with this is that will
say<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.190> wanted<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.700> learn<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> song<00:03:03.270> from<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
say you wanted to learn a song from a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.370 
say you wanted to learn a song from a
record<00:03:04.560> y<00:03:04.590> am<00:03:04.830> old<00:03:05.010> enough<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.310> say<00:03:05.430> record<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
record y am old enough to say record and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.230 
record y am old enough to say record and
you're<00:03:07.380> not<00:03:07.560> exactly<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.460> same<00:03:08.700> tune<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
you're not exactly in the same tune that

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.290 
you're not exactly in the same tune that
is<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.650> actually<00:03:10.730> disengage<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.970> tuning

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
is you can actually disengage the tuning

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.190 
is you can actually disengage the tuning
peg<00:03:12.510> by<00:03:13.260> pulling<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.710> out<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.990> if<00:03:15.990> you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
peg by pulling it out and then if you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.970 
peg by pulling it out and then if you
can<00:03:16.410> hear<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:18.630> changing<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> tune<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.830> a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
can hear I'm changing the tune just a

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.750 
can hear I'm changing the tune just a
little<00:03:20.250> bit<00:03:20.870> re-engage<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.080> peg<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.760> then

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
little bit re-engage the peg and then

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.420 
little bit re-engage the peg and then
you<00:03:23.880> turn<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.270> dial<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:26.130> eye

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.539 

press<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.629> then<00:03:30.530> hit<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.980> two<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:31.340> want

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
press it and then hit the two you want

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.800 
press it and then hit the two you want
to<00:03:31.670> reference

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
to reference

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.900 
to reference
when<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.560> turns<00:03:34.830> green<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.489> means<00:03:35.520> it's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
when that turns green it means it's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.660 
when that turns green it means it's
accepted<00:03:36.450> as<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.750> reference<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.440> me<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.280> now

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
accepted as the reference to me and now

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.140 
accepted as the reference to me and now
you<00:03:38.730> strum<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.209> again

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
you strum it again

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.089 
you strum it again
you<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.689> see<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.140> machines<00:03:41.590> are<00:03:41.799> moving

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
you can see all the machines are moving

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.210 
you can see all the machines are moving
except<00:03:42.519> for<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.819> one<00:03:42.879> machine<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.040> what

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
except for that one machine and so what

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.830 
except for that one machine and so what
it's<00:03:45.370> doing<00:03:45.459> now<00:03:45.849> is<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:46.239> tuning<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.720> to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
it's doing now is it's tuning it to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.399 
it's doing now is it's tuning it to
standard<00:03:47.379> tuning<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:48.970> doing<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
standard tuning but it's doing it to the

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.199 
standard tuning but it's doing it to the
reference<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.280> have<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:51.879> it's<00:03:52.000> not

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
reference that you have so it's not

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.429 
reference that you have so it's not
exactly<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:54.010> can<00:03:54.189> hear<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:55.110> ate<00:03:56.110> it<00:03:56.349> because

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
exactly you can hear it ate it because

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.429 
exactly you can hear it ate it because
it's<00:03:56.709> not<00:03:56.859> it's<00:03:57.489> not<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.819> tune<00:03:58.060> right<00:03:58.269> now<00:03:58.510> but

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
it's not it's not in tune right now but

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.809 
it's not it's not in tune right now but
you<00:03:59.560> can<00:03:59.709> actually<00:03:59.920> hear<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.670> it's

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
you can actually hear that it's

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.849 
you can actually hear that it's
completely<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.450> tune<00:04:01.689> to<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.230> reference

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
completely in tune to that reference

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.770 
completely in tune to that reference
done<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.459> then<00:04:03.939> all<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.180> have<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.480> do<00:04:04.599> to

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
done and then all you have to do to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.420 
done and then all you have to do to
bring<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.079> back<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.470> standard<00:04:05.859> tuning<00:04:06.069> again

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
bring it back to standard tuning again

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.880 
bring it back to standard tuning again
is<00:04:06.549> just<00:04:06.579> again<00:04:07.060> pull<00:04:07.359> it<00:04:07.450> out<00:04:07.599> and<00:04:07.840> then<00:04:08.709> go<00:04:08.859> to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
is just again pull it out and then go to

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.300 
is just again pull it out and then go to
standard<00:04:09.400> tuning<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:11.200> just<00:04:11.379> strum<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
standard tuning and just strum it the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.869 
standard tuning and just strum it the
system<00:04:12.760> will<00:04:12.819> also<00:04:13.239> allow<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:14.879> intonate

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879
