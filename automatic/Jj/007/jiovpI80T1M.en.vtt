00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.360
 hello everyone I'm dani and I'm here 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.670
 new in minecraft to bring you a 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.410
 informative video about the channel now 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.300
 background're seeing the same gameplay 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.119
 of the projecting server is I think it was 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.619
 of the beta server more specifically like this 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.990
 that you will have in the description of the video 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.430
 the link if you want to play and good 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.020
 I do this video basically for 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.970
 answer some questions that I 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.129
 you are doing many of you 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.019
 about the channel and others and good I'm going to 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.970
 clarify the doubts that you have or at least 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.739
 I will try the first of what 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.690
 I wanted to talk is about the frequency with 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.730
 the one that I'm uploading videos lately 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.290
 and is that the same I have very little time 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.450
 to record since I'm studying and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.280
 working at the same time 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.719
 I usually work on weekends 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.489
 so I 'm a bit caught between 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.469
 the studies and the work basically 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.879
 all the time you have also 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.399
 asked why I make videos so 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.200
 short and well precisely this is why 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.730
 same if one day I have a bit of 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.320
 time to record and I have to choose 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.390
 between recording a video even if it's more 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.700
 short or not record video I think it's 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.500
 better the first option to consider 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.180
 also that my videos are not gameplays 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 but they are more elaborate videos than 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.080
 they have a pretty big vision behind 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.640
 and make a video of what I do 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.830
 normally carries some 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.870
 or three hours since the ico that video 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 I'll climb until finally is 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.440
 uploaded and if I made gameplays 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.150
 I could surely make more videos and 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.740
 longer but is that right now 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.450
 I can because the microphone that I have does not 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.090
 I better because it is a microphone 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.830
 guitar hero is the only thing I have usb and 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.600
 is very sensitive to distance if I 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.460
 I approach a little bit as you can see 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.159
 much stronger besides to listen to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.800
 fatal and if I walk away just a little bit it 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.690
 listen very very weak as you will understand 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.040
 playing totally still is impossible 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.320
 so I need good headphones 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.240
 with microphone but right now I do not have 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.860
 at least I do not have some that are worth 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 because it 's the computer that I have not 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.610
 has jack input but that's a 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.170
 line entry that is similar but not 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.759
 it's like it does not work for me it 's basically 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.229
 the ones that I have so I have to 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.660
 buy me some good headphones with 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.119
 microphone or a microphone he hears uncle uncle 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.399
 of those but they are quite expensive so 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.560
 I will buy it as soon as I can and good 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.269
 Just remember also that you have 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.950
 until Sunday to participate in the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.300
 draw of the premium account that I am 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.530
 doing on twitter 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.590
 you will have all the data in the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.350
 description of the video and a little more tomorrow 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.890
 or last I'll upload an analysis one way or 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.770
 an island minecraft news 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.360
