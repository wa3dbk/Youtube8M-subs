hi<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:01.079> test<00:00:01.380> of<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:02.190> sank<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.210> cos<00:00:04.200> 11

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hi this is a test of the sank in cos 11

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.360 
hi this is a test of the sank in cos 11
D<00:00:05.299> level<00:00:06.299> ear<00:00:06.420> microphone<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:07.290> just<00:00:08.069> picked<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
D level ear microphone I just picked it

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.530 
D level ear microphone I just picked it
up<00:00:08.519> I've<00:00:08.820> got<00:00:09.570> two<00:00:09.840> mics<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.320> me<00:00:10.500> now<00:00:10.710> I've<00:00:11.070> got

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
up I've got two mics on me now I've got

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.150 
up I've got two mics on me now I've got
the<00:00:12.540> COS<00:00:13.530> 11<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.190> I've<00:00:14.849> got<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.389> sennheiser

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
the COS 11 and I've got the sennheiser

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.429 
the COS 11 and I've got the sennheiser
me2<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.640> comes<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.690> sennheiser<00:00:19.080> kit

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
me2 that comes with the sennheiser kit

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.779 
me2 that comes with the sennheiser kit
the<00:00:20.189> me2<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.390> through<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.500> g2<00:00:23.250> wireless

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the me2 is going through a g2 wireless

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.580 
the me2 is going through a g2 wireless
system<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:26.039> COS<00:00:27.000> 11<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:28.260> through<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
system and the COS 11 is going through a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.790 
system and the COS 11 is going through a
g3<00:00:29.279> wireless<00:00:30.000> system<00:00:30.390> they're<00:00:31.140> set<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.529> as

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
g3 wireless system they're set up as

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.020 
g3 wireless system they're set up as
close<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.340> could<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:33.050> although<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:35.030> set

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
close as I could get them although I set

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
close as I could get them although I set
the<00:00:36.420> output<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.590> little<00:00:38.070> lower<00:00:38.480> for<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> COS<00:00:40.290> 11

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the output a little lower for the COS 11

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.569 
the output a little lower for the COS 11
because<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.570> more<00:00:42.809> sensitive<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> louder

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
because it was more sensitive and louder

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.150 
because it was more sensitive and louder
so<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> wanted<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> kind<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.629> equalize<00:00:46.160> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
so I wanted to kind of equalize the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340 
so I wanted to kind of equalize the
sounds<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.760> bit<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.420> still<00:00:48.660> coming<00:00:49.140> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
sounds a little bit it's still coming in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.410 
sounds a little bit it's still coming in
hotter<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> sounds<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hotter I like the way it sounds it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.340 
hotter I like the way it sounds it
sounds<00:00:51.809> great<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:53.730> don't<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> handling

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
sounds great I don't like the handling

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:05.539 
sounds great I don't like the handling
noise<00:00:57.620> sync<00:00:58.620> in<00:01:00.949> San<00:01:01.949> Heiser<00:01:04.400> actually<00:01:05.400> what

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
noise sync in San Heiser actually what

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.990 
noise sync in San Heiser actually what
I'm<00:01:05.670> hearing<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> mic<00:01:06.360> moving<00:01:07.670> there<00:01:08.670> I'm

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I'm hearing is the mic moving there I'm

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.789 
I'm hearing is the mic moving there I'm
letting<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.170> cables<00:01:12.590> rubbing<00:01:13.590> them<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> same

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
letting the cables rubbing them the same

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.270 
letting the cables rubbing them the same
the<00:01:16.799> cos<00:01:17.280> 11<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.750> lot<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.350> susceptible<00:01:19.710> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the cos 11 is a lot more susceptible to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
the cos 11 is a lot more susceptible to
handling<00:01:21.240> noise<00:01:21.710> which<00:01:22.729> I'm<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:24.060> too<00:01:24.420> happy

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
handling noise which I'm not too happy

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.130 
handling noise which I'm not too happy
about<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> let's<00:01:27.180> try<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.540> announcer<00:01:27.930> voice

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
it acts as a bit of a wind protection my

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.770 

I'm<00:04:44.560> here<00:04:44.950> in<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> cos<00:04:45.790> eleven<00:04:46.330> but<00:04:46.510> I'm<00:04:46.600> not

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
I'm here in the cos eleven but I'm not

00:04:46.780 --> 00:05:07.050 
I'm here in the cos eleven but I'm not
here<00:04:47.050> in<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.290> me2<00:04:57.360> me1<00:05:02.880> tapping<00:05:05.100> will<00:05:06.100> cos<00:05:06.550> cos

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
here in the me2 me1 tapping will cos cos

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:17.960 
here in the me2 me1 tapping will cos cos
eleven<00:05:08.490> tapping<00:05:12.780> me2<00:05:13.780> tapping<00:05:14.700> hmm<00:05:16.110> louder

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970

rubbing

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.620 

I<00:05:25.130> guess<00:05:26.130> there<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.460> handling<00:05:26.910> noise<00:05:27.060> on<00:05:27.330> both

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
I guess there is handling noise on both

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.420 
I guess there is handling noise on both
of<00:05:27.900> them<00:05:29.750> anyways<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.080> don't<00:05:31.919> know<00:05:31.980> what<00:05:32.130> else<00:05:32.280> I

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
of them anyways I don't know what else I

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.360 
of them anyways I don't know what else I
can<00:05:32.490> do<00:05:32.760> that's<00:05:33.360> my<00:05:33.600> test<00:05:33.960> best<00:05:34.800> as<00:05:34.949> I<00:05:35.070> can<00:05:35.130> do

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
can do that's my test best as I can do

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.890 
can do that's my test best as I can do
non-scientific<00:05:36.229> but<00:05:37.229> I<00:05:37.650> definitely<00:05:38.130> am

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
non-scientific but I definitely am

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.140 
non-scientific but I definitely am
digging<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.020> cos<00:05:40.440> 11<00:05:40.970> except<00:05:41.970> for<00:05:42.090> the

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
digging the cos 11 except for the

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.540 
digging the cos 11 except for the
handling<00:05:42.449> noise
