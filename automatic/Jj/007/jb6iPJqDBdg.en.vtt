00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.570
 literally as turan means not 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.810
 quite clear but some argue 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.790
 what tourists or tourist if 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 continue the logical chain 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.760
 it means motorist for 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.890
 big company in this regard 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.279
 Volkswagen touran looks like 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.789
 exactly the car that fits 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.919
 these definitions so it should be 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.410
 affordable and comfortable and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.350
 practical 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.620
 but this is an illusion since accessibility is possible 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.330
 immediately dispute the cost of marital 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.710
 car we got 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.520
 creeps up to a half million budget 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.060
 money, respectively, who has such 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.330
 money will still think what is best for the family and 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.150
 Volkswagen turan or a good SUV 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.040
 and rolling the rails in so I generally can keep quiet 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.830
 someone bribing is appearance especially 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.420
 she refreshed the lattice 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.010
 chrome appeared and indeed 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.020
 the car has become more visually 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.420
 collected and youthful but neither luxurious and 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.750
 modern 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 So let's continue practicality, but this is not 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.560
 only comfortable own flesh but 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.400
 and passengers and cargo compartment 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.870
 brain head of the department full order she 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.710
 big on until it comes out 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.590
 third row of seats costing in 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 additional 33 thousand rubles 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.969
 and then 2 each k remains beautician 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.460
 but let's play virtual 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.860
 cargo carrier from lodge at all 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.740
 all it takes 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.710
 so cargo compartment 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 spacious but second row of seats 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.800
 it is necessary to select some solutions for centuries and 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.020
 the honor of the bow fall 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.759
 and this is forgiveness, but uncomfortable you eat 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.649
 extra spaces in general, malfunction h 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.659
 not too confident but 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.960
 back to the cabin visually he is poor 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.079
 as a church mouse is everything you need 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.789
 and why if 3 thousand rubles you can 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.880
 wrapped in brown leather 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.579
 which is not similar to the skin but it 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.899
 does not add joy yes sit comfortably yes 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.750
 gaps mosquito nose is not undermined but tasco 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.140
 German 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 for some reason it seems to me that movement is 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 miracle 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.790
 townspeople 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.510
 our cars are under the hood 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.250
 gasoline engine volume by whole 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.020
 four tenths of a liter and a power of 141 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.100
 figure quite good but in practice according to 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.040
 six-speed DJ machine 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.260
 Works fun only obviously 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.990
 there is a shortage of torque 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.410
 this moment is a bit but still spoils 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.250
 switching 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.300
 she sure accelerates to bad 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.980
 brake clearly enters the turns 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 following the commands of the easy helmsman 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.950
 wheels a little money behind the suspension number 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.620
 work hard and softens the bumps but that's all 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.770
 not this and not poland 1 it's just 2 1 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.709
 twofold feelings at me is overwhelmed 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.259
 the form of this car but one thing is for sure 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.479
 it seems exactly what a dream looks like 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.659
 the number of old age pensioners 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.510
 from east germany
