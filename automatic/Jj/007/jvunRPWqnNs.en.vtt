00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.339
 at n ° 1 a nissan skyline gt-r 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.339
 r34 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.370
 the real one for a whopping 300,000 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.080
 there is the gt r of paul walker 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:31.020
 from the fourth part of the feature film series 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:40.020
 no joke here the proof of the original 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 hollywood rent a contract 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.270
 together 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.250
 Paul Walker wanted it that way 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.220
 the car for the fourth part of almost 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 furious and with the rims as well now 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.210
 is in with the computer and that is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.860
 the original movie car was 18 different 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.690
 and that is the original one of him 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.309
 Bund is not damaged by 17 man so 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 remains dangerous 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 i say skyline you only know 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.579
 as well as this is there's like 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 once the movie bolide was made especially for 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.600
 the fourth part rebuilt body kit with 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670
 bumper and side skirts 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
 deepening and a racing sport 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.869
 brake system are installed 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.090
 So at first glance no blender 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.909
 the price of gt-r skin goes though 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.800
 The seller wants a whopping € 300,000 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.910
 to have 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.910
 300,000 cunningham forgotten pharmacy 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.550
 but you should not forget 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.770
 if the thing costs 100 you will also meet 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.390
 again the paul walker and if you like that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.610
 an insane fan is that she is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.000
 so important is alex tui gage out because 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.920
 Well, shit if you can 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.230
 necessary small change brings then there's 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.150
 to the car namely the all inclusive meet 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.570
 and greet package with the movie star 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:03.280
 on top of that, it was slightly inflated 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:05.800
 it clearly synonymous straight engine gfk is clear 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.080
 yes lose a little weight and 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.280
 then we have a six-cylinder 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.790
 behind and we have 550 ps wants 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.030
 I feel that you can do it 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.280
 you can inflate it up to 1500 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.780
 ps if boost pressure not only because people 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.580
 then had to change the other things 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.970
 but that kids just need 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.970
 sometimes 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.540
 with volume 2 liters 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.990
 that means for me the power must be on 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.160
 the train 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:03:00.820
 let me, I must be pure test drive should 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:03.190
 his song has already experienced a lot and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.080
 Almost all dream cars have already driven 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.630
 but this nissan is also for the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.200
 hardcore professionals just not 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.200
 a car 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:25.340
 4000 tours that sounds pretty nice 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.820
 but have created a driving behavior 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.350
 beyond compare 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.820
 there must be other drives 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.820
 that the fell to the point 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.209
 a sound 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.320
 the 550 ps presented neatly in the 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:57.650
 seat amazing the mileage only 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:04:00.290
 5000 km of the car down in any case 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.420
 in it but the machine distributed white 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.490
 also know because you can stay here 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.280
 dare to program everything what the box 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.250
 we should do with 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.530
 on-board computer for the on-board computer 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.720
 to optimize the vehicle is after 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.350
 award the filming in vehicle 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.510
 and the best he really works 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.220
 also with it roll cage sports seats 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.220
 and the steering wheel on the wrong side 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.100
 the four-wheel drive brings the brute 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:39.200
 power of japan on the street of the gt 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:41.840
 r is a real street racer that the 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.710
 I catapult to the front 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.570
 almost or almost ask the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:55.729
 original car original feelings 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:05:00.530
 absolute hammer good kick kelly too 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:05.410
 here the saying 300,000 completely 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.410
 stupid and by gold place one
