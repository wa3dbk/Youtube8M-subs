horse and it's got something that they
call<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> prehensile<00:03:59.939> tail<00:04:00.479> that<00:04:01.319> means<00:04:01.530> it's

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
call a prehensile tail that means it's

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.119 
call a prehensile tail that means it's
like<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.919> monkey<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.900> strangely<00:04:04.530> enough<00:04:04.650> it's

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
like a monkey and strangely enough it's

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.599 
like a monkey and strangely enough it's
with<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.819> male's<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.329> gives<00:04:06.659> birth<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:08.400> what

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
with the male's that gives birth so what

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.949 
with the male's that gives birth so what
you're<00:04:08.790> going<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.120> doing<00:04:09.329> when<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.750> make

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
you're going to be doing when you make

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.869 
you're going to be doing when you make
your<00:04:10.199> seahorse<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.979> putting<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.459> coloring

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
your seahorse is putting this coloring

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.390 
your seahorse is putting this coloring
like<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:13.799> you're<00:04:13.979> just<00:04:14.129> gonna

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
like this and then you're just gonna

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.390 
like this and then you're just gonna
twist<00:04:14.790> your<00:04:15.150> color<00:04:15.449> like<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:17.250> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
twist your color like that and it

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.490 
twist your color like that and it
doesn't<00:04:17.430> look<00:04:17.849> like<00:04:17.909> much<00:04:18.329> at<00:04:18.359> first<00:04:18.810> but<00:04:19.289> what

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
doesn't look like much at first but what

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500 
doesn't look like much at first but what
happens<00:04:20.039> when<00:04:20.279> you<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.609> that

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
happens when you do that

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.850 
happens when you do that
you're<00:04:23.510> combining<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:24.230> those<00:04:24.410> colors

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
you're combining all those colors

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.160 
you're combining all those colors
together<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:26.300> kind<00:04:26.570> of<00:04:26.630> can<00:04:26.840> give<00:04:27.020> the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
together and it kind of can give the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.940 
together and it kind of can give the
look<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.530> marble<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:32.300> end<00:04:32.570> all<00:04:33.410> right<00:04:33.710> that

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
look of marble the end all right that

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.990 
look of marble the end all right that
template<00:04:34.520> had<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:35.060> ball<00:04:36.020> like<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:37.010> now

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
template had the ball like that and now

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.240 
template had the ball like that and now
we're<00:04:38.300> going<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.720> make<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.110> egg<00:04:39.290> shape<00:04:41.170> and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
we're going to make the egg shape and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.560 
we're going to make the egg shape and
this<00:04:43.250> is<00:04:43.460> where<00:04:43.730> you're<00:04:44.030> going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.300> start

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
this is where you're going to start

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.030 
this is where you're going to start
making<00:04:44.810> your<00:04:45.080> seahorse<00:04:45.590> you're<00:04:45.830> going<00:04:45.980> to

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
making your seahorse you're going to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.920 
making your seahorse you're going to
make<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:47.390> long<00:04:47.660> part<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.230> the<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:50.030> egg<00:04:50.270> starts

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
make the long part of the the egg starts

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.160 
make the long part of the the egg starts
becoming<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.650> tail<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:53.630> can<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.870> see<00:04:54.050> how

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
becoming the tail and can you see how

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.140 
becoming the tail and can you see how
just<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.830> little<00:04:55.010> bit<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.280> color<00:04:55.640> went<00:04:56.000> in

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
just that little bit of color went in

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.080 
just that little bit of color went in
there<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:57.470> makes<00:04:57.710> all<00:04:57.920> that<00:04:58.130> lovely<00:04:58.520> lines<00:04:58.820> of

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
there it makes all that lovely lines of

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.790 
there it makes all that lovely lines of
color<00:04:59.270> just<00:04:59.600> like<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.960> would<00:05:00.050> be<00:05:00.230> in<00:05:00.350> marble

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
color just like it would be in marble

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.090 
color just like it would be in marble
and<00:05:01.720> up<00:05:02.720> here<00:05:03.050> I'm<00:05:03.260> going<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.530> form<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.070> head

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
and up here I'm going to form the head

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.410 
and up here I'm going to form the head
on<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.670> neck<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:07.430> don't<00:05:07.670> forget<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.240> a

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
on the neck and don't forget this is a

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.190 
on the neck and don't forget this is a
fish<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.320> so<00:05:09.650> fishes<00:05:10.130> have<00:05:10.850> fins<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:11.990> does

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
fish and so fishes have fins and so does

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.740 
fish and so fishes have fins and so does
a<00:05:12.230> seahorse<00:05:12.800> there's<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.640> number<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:14.090> fins<00:05:14.450> on

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
a seahorse there's a number of fins on

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.130 
a seahorse there's a number of fins on
its<00:05:14.990> head<00:05:15.230> that<00:05:15.560> you're<00:05:15.770> not<00:05:15.980> going<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.310> make

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.950 
a little bit soft so it doesn't allow me
to<00:06:11.030> do<00:06:11.360> it<00:06:11.510> exactly<00:06:12.140> the<00:06:12.919> way<00:06:12.950> I'd<00:06:13.220> like<00:06:13.400> to

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.839 

but<00:06:18.960> that's<00:06:19.199> that's<00:06:19.919> how<00:06:20.190> we're<00:06:20.400> coming<00:06:20.699> wrong

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
but that's that's how we're coming wrong

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.610 
but that's that's how we're coming wrong
and<00:06:21.590> I<00:06:22.590> will<00:06:22.919> see<00:06:23.160> you<00:06:23.280> later
