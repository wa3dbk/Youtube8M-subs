00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.560
 hello welcome to drawing of symmetries to play in this demonstration we are going to 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.329
 to learn 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.329
 to draw fibers and myths to play 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 the easiest way to learn from him by a couple of examples 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.089
 heuer asymmetric 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.019
 are those that as is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 they have two identical and opposite parts with respect to an axis or plane of symmetry 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.589
 this line that you see here 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.589
 a point and plot would represent the plane axis of symmetry 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 and here we have the two parts and metrics of the figure 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.660
 to draw this figure using autocad symmetry commands 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 we would have previously had to draw one of the halves and metrics 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.410
 for example half of the left 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.740
 and then we could start using the command 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.070
 symmetries a command that was in the modifier bar is a modifier 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.540
 to be here is the modified spa bar we have the tool command 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.430
 we select them 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.230
 and the first thing the program asks us 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.290
 is that we finish ourselves 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.890
 the lines that are going to participate in the symmetry 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.590
 how are all these lines going to be? 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.040
 a box of the selected 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.400
 we deliver all the lines 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.480
 pane we will know designated objects of symmetry 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 next we present before 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.820
 to move on to the second part of the command which is to determine the axis of 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 symmetry 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 It is enough with 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.980
 click two points of the scenario that represents ncg is not even it is 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.030
 necessary 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.620
 what did you choose drawn 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.460
 for example these two points 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.440
 then the program asks them if we want to keep the first part 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.180
 of the drawing 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.520
 that is, if we want to erase the origin or maintain the origin normally when 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.130
 let's make pieces by symmetry or figures by symmetry we want to keep both 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 parts then to this question we will answer no 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 and then the text 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.570
 and with this we would have finished a simple symmetry 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.440
 there are also figures that have if he lied about two axes as is the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.629
 case of sta cross 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.019
 and down here 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.120
 in this case we would proceed in the same way by means of the symmetries 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.579
 consecutive 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 we request the symmetry modifier 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.289
 we capture in a window 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.949
 the fourth of the piece in this case 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.319
 below people 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.379
 and we designate what would be the first axis of symmetry for example the vertical axis 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.209
 back to the question is if we want to achieve the origin we answer that no 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.399
 in the time 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:48.529
 with this we would already have one half of the piece built from a quarter 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.549
 and re-selecting the command in symmetry 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.649
 we select the symmetrical half that we already have between 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.749
 and then the axis of symmetry that in this case would be front lcd 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.579
 we keep the figure lightly 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.799
 and with this we will have finished 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.209
 this piece that you have symmetry with respect to the planes to be respected 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.499
 v is to finish the demonstration just remember the key points 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.150
 of the symmetry command and that is that we have to have the goal drawn first 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.229
 symmetric in the case of a 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.609
 figure 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.349
 ondacc fcc put a quarter of that figure below we will have to 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.129
 determine the axis simply by two points 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.239
 and finally we will indicate to the program if we want 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.859
 in erasing or not the part that she that we already have drawn 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:41.459
 thank you
