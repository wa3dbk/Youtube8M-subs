00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.759
 cellular let's go back and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949

 standard and also what it is I do not know if it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.060
 you can see microusb which is the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.740
 universal charger let's say

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.380
 the youtube functions what is a 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.080
 application that we can download through 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.890
 from the play store and we will show you what 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.890
 what is some video 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.799
 let's go back and go to 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.390
 explain it a little bit about what the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.440
 functions and things we can do 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.940
 that 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.100
 both pressing that is the button this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.540
 go closing all the applications that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.910
 they are staying open that we are going to 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.520
 using so that they do not consume us what 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.950
 what is ram memory 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 also another very important thing is 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.799
 add a microsd card to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.509
 save what are photos and videos and 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.270
 also some applications that you 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.929
 let us forget how we do 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.179
 this one adjustment we always go to the part 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.649
 of applications and here they will appear 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.680
 all the applications that we have 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.530
 downloaded that in this case are 3 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.660
 being the card part sd we are going to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.730
 appear the applications that we can 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.100
 pass to memory that in this case is 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.320
 the instagram and the pop 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.120
 we simply move the switch to homs 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.790
 as it is now and they are already 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.160
 automatically to the sd card like 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.020
 we can see the whatsapp does not let you 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.110
 there are some applications that are 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.410
 can and others that do not and this depends on 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410
 the application 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.110
 another very important thing is that with this 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.660
 phone we have what is connectivity 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.400
 og jose that in a personal clearing or 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.270
 movistar we put a chip and we can 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.190
 navigate at speed 12 to realize 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.570
 that we are navigating and that we can 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.230
 navigate we have to go to the networks 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.140
 mobile and in apn we have to create here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.710
 it says clearly what is our apn we are going to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.730
 new apn and we fill what they are all 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.310
 these others with the data 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.410
 corresponding from our operator if 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.320
 they do not have them they can send us an email 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.080
 we spent it again 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.200
 backwards 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.270
 and what we have is instagram that what 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.590
 we can install on the whatsapp cell phone 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.240
 which is one of the most applications 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.540
 known that is the most used 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.950
 in what is a cell phone with system 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.950
 android and for example 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.939
