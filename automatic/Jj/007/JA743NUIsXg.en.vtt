30 years and that helps me to maintain

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.050 
30 years and that helps me to maintain
my<00:00:17.779> youthful<00:00:18.779> vigor<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.260> enthusiasm<00:00:19.910> gets<00:00:20.910> me

my youthful vigor and enthusiasm gets me

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.509 
my youthful vigor and enthusiasm gets me
into<00:00:21.180> trouble<00:00:21.359> sometimes<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.560> yeah<00:00:23.220> that's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
into trouble sometimes but yeah that's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.359 
into trouble sometimes but yeah that's
what<00:00:23.730> life's<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.369> by

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
what life's all about and that by

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.470 
what life's all about and that by
walking<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.910> your<00:00:27.090> hands<00:00:27.510> uses<00:00:28.470> up<00:00:28.849> 33<00:00:29.849> times

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
walking on your hands uses up 33 times

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.170 
walking on your hands uses up 33 times
more<00:00:30.990> oxygen<00:00:31.769> than<00:00:32.009> walking<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.640> your<00:00:32.850> feet

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
more oxygen than walking on your feet

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.069 
more oxygen than walking on your feet
okay<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> confrontational

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
okay so it's a confrontational

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.740 
okay so it's a confrontational
cardiovascular<00:00:37.079> exercise<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.750> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cardiovascular exercise and it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
cardiovascular exercise and it's
utilizing<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.829> uncommon<00:00:41.309> postures<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> we

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
utilizing the uncommon postures that we

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
utilizing the uncommon postures that we
don't<00:00:42.420> normally<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:43.079> into<00:00:43.410> okay<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
don't normally get into okay all the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.840 
don't normally get into okay all the
time<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.360> sitting<00:00:45.690> standing<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.620> lied<00:00:46.890> 24

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
time was sitting standing and lied 24

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.720 
time was sitting standing and lied 24
hours<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.239> day<00:00:48.500> we<00:00:49.500> never<00:00:49.680> extend<00:00:50.219> our<00:00:50.399> bodies

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
hours a day we never extend our bodies

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.240 
hours a day we never extend our bodies
backwards<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.539> few<00:00:52.140> minutes<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.500> day<00:00:52.680> doing<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
backwards a few minutes a day doing that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.020 
backwards a few minutes a day doing that
offsets<00:00:53.910> many<00:00:54.329> hours<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.809> day<00:00:54.989> which<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:56.030> built

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
offsets many hours a day which are built

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
offsets many hours a day which are built
into<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.390> postural<00:00:57.899> debt<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:58.649> sitting

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
into a postural debt when you're sitting

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.450 
into a postural debt when you're sitting
and<00:00:59.370> standing<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.739> gravity<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.800> compressing

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and standing so gravity is compressing

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.630 
and standing so gravity is compressing
the<00:01:02.579> spine<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.449> way<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:04.339> putting<00:01:05.339> stress

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the spine this way you're putting stress

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
the spine this way you're putting stress
on<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.090> areas<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.900> body<00:01:07.080> okay<00:01:07.430> there's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
on you areas of your body okay there's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.620 
on you areas of your body okay there's
three<00:01:08.580> common<00:01:09.090> postures<00:01:10.670> standing<00:01:11.670> sitting

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
three common postures standing sitting

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.340 
three common postures standing sitting
at<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> computers<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:14.670> day<00:01:15.350> sitting

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
at the computers all day sitting

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.179 
at the computers all day sitting
watching<00:01:16.680> TV<00:01:16.950> sitting<00:01:17.909> driving<00:01:18.479> car<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:20.009> all

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
watching TV sitting driving car it all

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.999 
watching TV sitting driving car it all
tends<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.880> compress<00:01:21.600> our<00:01:21.840> spines<00:01:22.200> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
tends to compress our spines so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
tends to compress our spines so
therefore<00:01:23.310> we've<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> spend<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> few

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
therefore we've got to spend a few

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
therefore we've got to spend a few
minutes<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.960> day<00:01:25.170> doing<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:26.159> corrective

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
minutes a day doing some corrective

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.230 
minutes a day doing some corrective
exercise<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.820> trying<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
exercise and this is what I'm trying to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
exercise and this is what I'm trying to
teach<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.590> people<00:01:31.799> understand

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
teach here to make people understand

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
teach here to make people understand
that<00:01:32.579> they've<00:01:32.790> got<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> intelligence<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that they've got the intelligence to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.399 
that they've got the intelligence to
realize<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:36.000> causing<00:01:36.270> problems<00:01:37.049> such

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
realize that we're causing problems such

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.640 
realize that we're causing problems such

we've<00:01:45.479> got<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.869> something<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.610> maintain

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
we've got to do something to maintain
