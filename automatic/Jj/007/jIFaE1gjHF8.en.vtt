hey and welcome to easily Ling today I
wanted<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.510> talk<00:00:03.600> about<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.170> reasons<00:00:04.529> we

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
wanted to talk about the reasons we

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.829 
wanted to talk about the reasons we
think<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.430> many<00:00:05.609> people<00:00:06.029> fail<00:00:06.299> at<00:00:06.600> losing

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
think so many people fail at losing

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.860 
think so many people fail at losing
weight<00:00:07.200> either<00:00:07.649> during<00:00:08.340> weight<00:00:08.550> loss<00:00:08.580> or<00:00:09.120> by

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
weight either during weight loss or by

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.690 
weight either during weight loss or by
regaining<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.500> weight<00:00:10.650> after<00:00:11.010> they've<00:00:11.490> hit

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
regaining the weight after they've hit

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.970 
regaining the weight after they've hit
their<00:00:11.849> goal<00:00:12.120> weight

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.700 

so<00:00:18.980> just<00:00:19.609> to<00:00:19.730> recap<00:00:19.880> our<00:00:20.300> views<00:00:20.599> we<00:00:21.410> believe

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
so just to recap our views we believe

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.830 
so just to recap our views we believe
weight<00:00:22.009> loss<00:00:22.250> should<00:00:22.730> be<00:00:22.849> achieved<00:00:23.179> gradually

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
weight loss should be achieved gradually

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.080 
weight loss should be achieved gradually
that<00:00:24.439> means<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.890> person<00:00:25.099> needs<00:00:25.429> a<00:00:25.579> diet<00:00:25.789> that

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
that means a person needs a diet that

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.179 
that means a person needs a diet that
they<00:00:26.239> can<00:00:26.419> maintain<00:00:26.630> for<00:00:27.230> over<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.500> year<00:00:27.590> if

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
they can maintain for over a year if

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.669 
they can maintain for over a year if
they<00:00:28.640> need<00:00:28.820> to<00:00:28.939> lose<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.149> lot<00:00:29.359> of<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.720> we<00:00:30.529> also

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
they need to lose a lot of that we also

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.319 
they need to lose a lot of that we also
believe<00:00:30.980> a<00:00:31.309> person<00:00:31.550> should<00:00:31.939> have<00:00:31.970> a<00:00:32.090> basic

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
believe a person should have a basic

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.420 
believe a person should have a basic
understanding<00:00:32.629> of<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.650> mechanisms<00:00:33.769> of<00:00:34.400> how

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
understanding of the mechanisms of how

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.390 
understanding of the mechanisms of how
fat<00:00:34.850> is<00:00:35.120> gained<00:00:35.420> or<00:00:35.570> lost<00:00:35.710> not<00:00:36.710> only<00:00:36.949> does<00:00:37.190> this

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
fat is gained or lost not only does this

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.689 
food options available now let's take a
look<00:00:54.320> at<00:00:54.470> some<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.920> reasons<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.489> people

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
look at some of the reasons that people

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.240 
look at some of the reasons that people
fail<00:00:56.180> at<00:00:56.210> losing<00:00:56.720> weight<00:00:56.949> according<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:57.979> some

fail at losing weight according to some

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.130 
fail at losing weight according to some
depressing<00:00:58.850> statistics<00:00:59.089> over<00:00:59.720> eighty

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
depressing statistics over eighty

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.619 
depressing statistics over eighty
percent<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.799> people<00:01:00.949> dieting<00:01:01.610> regain<00:01:02.360> all<00:01:02.390> the

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
percent of people dieting regain all the

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.149 
percent of people dieting regain all the
weight<00:01:02.960> they've<00:01:03.170> lost<00:01:03.439> after<00:01:03.799> they're

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
maybe only juice a lot of these diets

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.209 
maybe only juice a lot of these diets
have<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.200> may<00:01:21.350> be<00:01:21.409> eating<00:01:21.740> only<00:01:21.859> 800<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:24.219> 1,200

calories<00:01:25.459> a<00:01:25.729> day<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.719> they're<00:01:26.929> ridiculously

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
calories a day so they're ridiculously

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.219 
calories a day so they're ridiculously
low<00:01:27.799> in<00:01:27.920> calories<00:01:28.539> thankfully<00:01:29.539> they<00:01:29.750> normally

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
low in calories thankfully they normally

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.020 
low in calories thankfully they normally
only<00:01:30.349> last<00:01:30.679> a<00:01:30.829> couple<00:01:30.859> weeks<00:01:31.280> because<00:01:31.819> they

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
only last a couple weeks because they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.459 
only last a couple weeks because they
could<00:01:32.209> probably<00:01:32.420> cause<00:01:32.719> some<00:01:32.959> serious<00:01:33.259> damage

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
could probably cause some serious damage

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.440 
could probably cause some serious damage
if<00:01:34.069> you<00:01:34.099> kept<00:01:34.459> doing<00:01:34.670> them<00:01:34.880> for<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> couple

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
if you kept doing them for a couple

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.749 
if you kept doing them for a couple
months<00:01:35.569> the<00:01:36.200> reason<00:01:36.619> these<00:01:36.770> diets<00:01:37.280> appear<00:01:37.640> to

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
months the reason these diets appear to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.639 
months the reason these diets appear to
work<00:01:37.939> is<00:01:38.209> they<00:01:38.450> normally<00:01:38.810> have<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.229> eaten<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
work is they normally have you eaten a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.410 
work is they normally have you eaten a
very<00:01:39.890> small<00:01:40.219> amount<00:01:40.549> of<00:01:40.700> food<00:01:41.000> or<00:01:41.359> just

very small amount of food or just
liquids<00:01:42.429> all<00:01:43.429> people<00:01:43.729> probably<00:01:44.179> have<00:01:44.450> around

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
liquids all people probably have around

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.839 
liquids all people probably have around
10<00:01:44.989> pounds<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.649> what<00:01:45.739> we<00:01:45.890> call<00:01:46.129> bloat<00:01:46.549> wait

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
10 pounds of what we call bloat wait

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:49.719 
10 pounds of what we call bloat wait
that's<00:01:47.239> easily<00:01:47.659> lose<00:01:48.110> about<00:01:48.409> it's<00:01:48.739> basically

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
that's easily lose about it's basically

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.630 
that's easily lose about it's basically
just<00:01:50.049> water<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.200> other<00:01:51.619> miscellaneous<00:01:51.920> body

it's not a good recipe for success if
you<00:04:44.980> actually<00:04:45.130> think<00:04:45.580> about<00:04:45.730> why<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.210> want<00:04:46.660> to
