00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
this thing a big list of chemistry yeah

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
this thing a big list of chemistry yeah
no<00:01:24.060> idea<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:25.610> have<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:28.220> pre-med<00:01:29.220> friend

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
