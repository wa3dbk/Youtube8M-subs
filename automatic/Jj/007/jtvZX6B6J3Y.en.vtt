so I'm thinking my very first thing to

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.359 
so I'm thinking my very first thing to
do<00:01:40.869> is<00:01:40.959> just<00:01:41.050> take<00:01:41.259> air<00:01:41.470> compressor<00:01:41.979> blow<00:01:42.190> all

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
do is just take air compressor blow all

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.669 
do is just take air compressor blow all
this<00:01:42.550> out<00:01:42.819> and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:44.259> get<00:01:45.039> my<00:01:45.190> por-15<00:01:45.580> out<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
this out and then get my por-15 out and

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.719 
this out and then get my por-15 out and
if<00:01:47.679> I<00:01:47.800> figure<00:01:48.099> out<00:01:48.160> how<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.310> make<00:01:48.459> that<00:01:48.550> little

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
if I figure out how to make that little

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.520 
if I figure out how to make that little
sprayer<00:01:49.090> work<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:49.630> spray<00:01:49.959> it<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.200> up<00:01:50.380> in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
sprayer work just spray it all up in
