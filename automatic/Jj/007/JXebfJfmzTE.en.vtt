it'll<00:01:27.259> be<00:01:27.830> on<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:28.880> move<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.630> obtain

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
it'll be on this but move it to obtain

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.499 
it'll be on this but move it to obtain
IP<00:01:30.409> address<00:01:30.820> automatically<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:34.180> do<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.299> same

IP address automatically and do the same

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:45.219 
IP address automatically and do the same
for<00:01:35.840> ipv6<00:01:39.789> ok<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:43.149> now<00:01:44.149> if<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:44.630> still<00:01:44.990> not
