use calico to send your robot command so

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.190 
use calico to send your robot command so
for<00:04:33.100> example<00:04:33.130> i<00:04:33.550> can<00:04:33.610> say<00:04:33.880> go<00:04:34.120> forward<00:04:35.220> at<00:04:37.200> half

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
for example i can say go forward at half
