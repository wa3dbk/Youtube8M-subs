00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it has runs down it's got two USBs right

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.100 
it has runs down it's got two USBs right
here<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.709> power<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.099> one<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.549> USB<00:02:24.110> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
here one is power and one is the USB you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.479 
here one is power and one is the USB you
don't<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.709> run<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:25.950> off<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.220> power<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
don't have to run this off the power I

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.920 
don't have to run this off the power I
don't<00:02:26.670> know<00:02:26.790> why<00:02:26.939> that<00:02:27.120> ones<00:02:27.329> on<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:27.659> so<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
don't know why that ones on there so I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.660 
don't know why that ones on there so I
usually<00:02:28.379> just<00:02:28.530> plug<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.129> in<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
usually just plug this one in but I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.670 
usually just plug this one in but I
guess<00:02:29.849> this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.390> charge<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.989> I'm<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.439> quite

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
guess this is to charge it I'm not quite

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860 
guess this is to charge it I'm not quite
sure<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.159> does<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.609> never<00:02:33.269> use<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.629> one<00:02:33.840> so

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
sure but it does I never use this one so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.610 
sure but it does I never use this one so
yeah<00:02:34.939> um<00:02:35.939> you're<00:02:36.810> also<00:02:36.930> gonna<00:02:37.140> get<00:02:37.319> this

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
yeah um you're also gonna get this

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.059 
yeah um you're also gonna get this
looking<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.609> thing<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:38.909> here<00:02:39.180> which<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:40.140> guess

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
looking a thing right here which I guess

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.500 
looking a thing right here which I guess
it's<00:02:41.310> supposed<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.849> where<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.239> set<00:02:42.480> up

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
it's supposed to be where you can set up

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.059 
it's supposed to be where you can set up
a<00:02:42.690> picture<00:02:42.900> frame<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.670> something<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.849> this

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
a picture frame like something like this

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.180 
a picture frame like something like this
I'm<00:02:47.069> not<00:02:47.220> quite<00:02:47.519> sure<00:02:47.549> where<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:47.970> put<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
I'm not quite sure where to put this I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.470 
I'm not quite sure where to put this I
don't<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.430> all<00:02:50.519> where<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.879> put<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.150> I'm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
don't know at all where to put that I'm

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.690 
don't know at all where to put that I'm
assuming<00:02:51.780> maybe<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.400> one<00:02:53.609> of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
assuming maybe it's for like one of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.539 
assuming maybe it's for like one of
these<00:02:53.790> holes<00:02:54.090> right<00:02:54.239> here<00:02:54.709> but<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:56.099> don't

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
these holes right here but I don't

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.009 
these holes right here but I don't
really<00:02:56.819> know<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.269> never<00:02:57.389> get<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> work

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
really know I can never get it to work

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.050 
really know I can never get it to work
so<00:02:58.079> oh<00:02:58.590> okay<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.609> we<00:02:59.700> go

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
so oh okay here we go

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.809 
so oh okay here we go
picture<00:03:00.810> stand<00:03:01.049> right<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.739> that's<00:03:02.639> what

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
picture stand right there so that's what

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.640 
picture stand right there so that's what
I'm<00:03:03.000> assuming<00:03:03.269> this<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:03.930> what<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.439> for

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
I'm assuming this that's what that's for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.110 
I'm assuming this that's what that's for
it's<00:03:04.799> not<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> pin<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.609> is<00:03:05.760> not<00:03:05.879> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it's not a pin because this is not a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.710 
it's not a pin because this is not a
touchscreen

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
touchscreen

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.349 
touchscreen
um<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.549> models<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> touch<00:03:09.329> screen

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
um one of the models is a touch screen

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.089 
um one of the models is a touch screen
of<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.989> nine<00:03:10.260> inch<00:03:10.439> one<00:03:10.590> I'm<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.829> quite<00:03:11.069> sure

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
of a nine inch one I'm not quite sure

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.699 
of a nine inch one I'm not quite sure
the<00:03:11.280> model<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:11.970> B<00:03:12.209> nine<00:03:12.450> oh<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
the model it's like B nine oh it's the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.369 
the model it's like B nine oh it's the
vs<00:03:14.220> 90<00:03:14.669> us<00:03:15.120> I'm<00:03:15.569> pretty<00:03:15.870> sure<00:03:16.019> that's<00:03:16.169> what<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
vs 90 us I'm pretty sure that's what it

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.250 
vs 90 us I'm pretty sure that's what it
is<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.359> overall<00:03:18.359> this<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.690> great<00:03:18.870> monitor

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
is so overall this is a great monitor

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.659 
is so overall this is a great monitor
