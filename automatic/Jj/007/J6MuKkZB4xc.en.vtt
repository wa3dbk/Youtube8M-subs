figured out ways of painting them that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.060 
figured out ways of painting them that
makes<00:01:08.600> some<00:01:08.750> pretty<00:01:08.960> scratch<00:01:09.320> resistant<00:01:09.890> but

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
makes some pretty scratch resistant but

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.670 
makes some pretty scratch resistant but
no<00:01:10.310> gloss<00:01:10.850> finishes<00:01:11.659> scratch<00:01:12.079> resistant<00:01:12.590> all

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
no gloss finishes scratch resistant all

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.350 
no gloss finishes scratch resistant all
