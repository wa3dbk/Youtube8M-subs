00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
earned point five millimeter increments

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.520

which<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> extremely<00:01:22.979> helpful<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.640> measuring

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
which is extremely helpful for measuring

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.399 
which is extremely helpful for measuring
because<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.020> rail<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.259> put

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because this this is the rail I'm at put

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679 
because this this is the rail I'm at put
on<00:01:28.500> my<00:01:28.619> shotgun<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.390> no

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
on my shotgun and up here there is no

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
on my shotgun and up here there is no
reference<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.350> anything<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> where<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> should

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
reference or anything to where it should

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
reference or anything to where it should
go<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:33.600> pretty<00:01:33.750> much<00:01:33.990> taking<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> shot<00:01:34.740> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
go so I'm pretty much taking a shot in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.789 
go so I'm pretty much taking a shot in
the<00:01:34.979> dark<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.299> doing<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.869> I'm

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the dark I know what I'm doing but I'm

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
the dark I know what I'm doing but I'm
just<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> where<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.790> it'll

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
just gonna put it where I think it'll

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.020 
just gonna put it where I think it'll
work<00:01:39.570> best<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:40.890> pretty<00:01:41.159> good<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.520> judging

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
work best and I'm pretty good at judging

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
work best and I'm pretty good at judging
about<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:43.290> underneath<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
about that because underneath here in

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
about that because underneath here in
the<00:01:44.310> bolt<00:01:44.549> there's<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.360> rail<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the bolt there's this little rail that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.859 
the bolt there's this little rail that
it<00:01:45.930> slides<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.579> bolt<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.390> bolt<00:01:48.540> rides

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it slides on and the bolt the bolt rides

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.530 
it slides on and the bolt the bolt rides
on<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.229> rail<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
on this rail up here it's kind of like a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
on this rail up here it's kind of like a
guide<00:01:51.780> rail<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.500> probably<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.920> drill<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
guide rail I'm probably gonna drill and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
guide rail I'm probably gonna drill and
tap<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.729> through<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.180> that'll<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
tap right through there that'll be a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.350 
tap right through there that'll be a
thicker<00:01:55.380> piece<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> aluminum<00:01:56.219> I'm<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.149> take

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
thicker piece of aluminum I'm gonna take

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.459 
thicker piece of aluminum I'm gonna take
this<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.810> starts<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:59.219> there<00:02:00.469> I'm

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
this it starts about right there I'm

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.240 
this it starts about right there I'm
gonna<00:02:01.670> measure<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.530> measured<00:02:04.950> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
gonna measure over and I measured this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.580 
gonna measure over and I measured this
exact<00:02:05.790> length<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.420> nine<00:02:06.659> millimeters<00:02:07.259> between

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
exact length as nine millimeters between

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.630 
exact length as nine millimeters between
these<00:02:08.280> two<00:02:08.489> points<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.239> here

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
these two points right here

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.010 
these two points right here
that's<00:02:11.640> exactly<00:02:12.000> nine<00:02:12.209> millimeters<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.959> I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
that's exactly nine millimeters so I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.960 
that's exactly nine millimeters so I
want<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.379> four

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
want to go four

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.870 
want to go four
four<00:02:14.970> point<00:02:15.540> five<00:02:15.780> millimeters<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.920> where<00:02:17.790> I'm

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
four point five millimeters is where I'm

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.970 
four point five millimeters is where I'm
gonna<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.569> them<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> halfway<00:02:19.380> point<00:02:19.590> in

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
gonna is them is the halfway point in

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.220 
gonna is them is the halfway point in
between<00:02:20.340> here<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.390> I'm<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.630> put

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
between here so that I'm going to put

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.530 
between here so that I'm going to put
this<00:02:22.380> on<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.730> I'm<00:02:23.790> gonna<00:02:23.910> like
