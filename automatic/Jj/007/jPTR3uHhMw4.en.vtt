00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.889

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.290
 you will see rooms 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.870

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.059
 dessert with less nourishment told me that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.059
 like the fire that erases the cold 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:02.910
 like the ice that the sun melted 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:08.270
 a poison that consumed me 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.270
 I took you down by saying goodbye 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 if you go 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:19.159
 tear my life 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.750

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.550
 tear my skin 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.030
 and take my eyes off so I can not see 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.460
 how are you going 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.580
 I can not stand your departure because my love 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.380
 looks so much and does not have a clue 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.630
 I will cry because love was lost and 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.020
 best detective can find the mistake 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.960
 take away the desire to see this situation 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.369
 make me think that here is the relationship 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.710
 I wanted a happy ending of accounts for 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.750
 please, but maybe you're happy and there was a 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 final worse and I said together forever 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.759
 but I did not expect that you have 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.280
 planned to wake up in another pillow by 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.960
 please leave me blind so as not to see when 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.649
 you've been in the middle of this 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.959
 I do not know where I am but I can play 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.120
 say that everything I feel and feel and 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.110
 I wanted to three meters above the sky but 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.880
 today I do not have a thousand inches in me 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.380
 if you go 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:27.090
 life 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.090
 tear it to pieces until there is nothing left 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.170

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 and take my eyes off so I can not see 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.550
 how are you going 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.069

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.500
 different distrust and love fit it in 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.660
 the same place you remember baby I know 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.760
 beating for me even though you hide and 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.489
 Even if you deny me, you are the kryptonite 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.310
 that takes away my powers like a flame 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.709
 that it was consumed nothing else that came to me 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.200

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.900

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.290
