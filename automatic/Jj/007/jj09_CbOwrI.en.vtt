00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 This video I will tell you how we will 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.750
 do five mortar here I decided to take 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.889
 for this business and now he is in stages 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.760
 I have read a lot of information already 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.880
 people done on the internet need 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 order the first such drawstring drawings 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 there are guys on the internet who are already 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 when they set up sell that is geharu 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.170
 faces don't particularly need enough of them 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.469
 just order me a guy sent from 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.129
 Moscow thousand rubles for it at all you 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.780
 it remains only to put fours 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.360
 switching and a little welding smelt 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 two disks 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.079
 here here we have two disks 1 2 2 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.719
 we have for fifth gear and that is who is not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 knows here for comparison the usual disk 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.260
 its essence is that we get here 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 these grooves are more you see here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.530
 it is neutral as it goes and they will force out 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.310
 more compressed and here is the edge when 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 transmission is activated 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 4 in my opinion here we have it here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.479
 turns on then goes to neutral and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.840
 everything 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.390
 and at this time it turns on 5 here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 principle and everything on the factory here this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.710
 the track just goes on the outside radius 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.119
 but we can shove it but difficult 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.200
 Other things that actively further as from interest 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.340
 we can weigh 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 so here we have a new weigh now we 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:53.689
 see 256 grams old weighs 166 not 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 very hard but also interesting 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.909
 so further boxes we need 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.890
 Here I have another box 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:10.299
 and here they are small 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:15.700
 primary secondary here we have life and 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:17.739
 we need to make it simple to say here 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 on extrude gear 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:27.190
 fixed 5 to 23 teeth 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 here drag on a lathe to 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.269
 diameter here vol 2 yes that's it 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:40.200
 diameter as there is a cut keyway 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:43.810
 groove put another gear 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.420
 gets show now here it is he from us 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.269
 worth 1 won 2 insist sheâ€™s not like that 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.670
 the front sight goes back protection transfer us 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.140
 include that is, we need here foot 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 switch here under the bench all 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:07.389
 humanly and put on it. 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:11.260
 it threw it away . 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.450
 and here the gear wheel will stand like this 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.790
 here's granddaughter will just move out 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.900
 on and off 5 gears and so it will 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.560
 just knurling to sow the seed freely then 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.470
 have understood pumped here keyway 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.750
 groove and and in my opinion it is still a little narrow 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.919
 here we are when only lucky 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.319
 look at the place and then it 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.720
 gear wheels 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.440
 primary 6 but here's a man told me 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.030
 you need to take Izhevsk 23 teeth so she 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.540
 so bought it in the market of infection is expensive 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.530
 350 rubles 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.959
 want pulteney threw up 1 rework there 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.430
 such thing plus we teach that she us 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.530
 factory cut tooth and a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.940
 uncemented plant that is they 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.100
 strong you see see start climbing we need 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.500
 there will still be machined and our thin 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.460
 fix tight too much everyone will 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.300
 will contact this will cut will take place only here 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:21.030
 gear 2 gear itself is done like this 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:25.620
 either gear 3 or second is taken 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.100
 transfer well here's a gear so here have 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 me another gear friend any of 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.290
 these big ones 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.470
 and the meaning is that there are even teeth who need 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.800
 cut outside drag outside diameter 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.210
 cut off the old teeth sharpen to 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.230
 a certain size and then chop 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:54.020
 New chisel here should be cut so 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:56.880
 so that between the center distance was 58 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.490
 47 as told to a man who 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.970
 sent the rocker exactly fifty eight 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.720
 forty seven that is if give a turner 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.450
 which fumbles in it he will understand 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.260
 it will be harder to have a snack 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:19.800
 will break the evil here so further we 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:24.440
 send this case to poplar and see what 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.440
 we got from this continue to enter
