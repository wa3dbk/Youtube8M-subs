much<00:00:47.250> happens<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> either<00:00:48.960> stretch

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
much happens when one you either stretch

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.330 
much happens when one you either stretch
too<00:00:49.649> fast<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.340> too<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:51.090> stretch<00:00:51.420> improperly

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
too fast or too you stretch improperly

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.069 
too fast or too you stretch improperly
and<00:00:53.340> pretty<00:00:54.270> much<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.600> happens<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and pretty much what happens is that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
and pretty much what happens is that
pressure<00:00:55.680> has<00:00:55.890> built<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> year

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
pressure has built up so much in a year

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
pressure has built up so much in a year
that<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.420> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.750> shoots<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> back

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that it kind of shoots out the back

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
that it kind of shoots out the back
instead<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> properly<00:00:59.969> stretching<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> skin

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
instead of properly stretching the skin

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
instead of properly stretching the skin
it<00:01:00.870> kind<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.399> pushes<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> back

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it kind of just pushes it out the back

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.299 
it kind of just pushes it out the back
which<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.199> good<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:05.070> doesn't

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
which is not so good it doesn't

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.090 
which is not so good it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:05.760> cause<00:01:06.330> any<00:01:06.570> harm<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.860> looks

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
necessarily cause any harm but it looks

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
necessarily cause any harm but it looks
really<00:01:08.310> ugly<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.360> pain<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.170> rid

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
really ugly and it's a pain to get rid

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890 
really ugly and it's a pain to get rid
of<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:10.890> treat<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.400> immediately<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
of if you don't treat it immediately and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.179 
of if you don't treat it immediately and
a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> people<00:01:13.470> say<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.070> only

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a lot of people say you know it only

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
a lot of people say you know it only
happens<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> people<00:01:15.000> who<00:01:15.030> stretched<00:01:15.390> too<00:01:15.540> fast

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
happens to people who stretched too fast

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
happens to people who stretched too fast
but<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.229> true<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.240> at

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
but that's not true because i was at

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.560 
but that's not true because i was at
seven<00:01:18.900> 16s<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.680> eight<00:01:20.100> months<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.450> i

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
seven 16s for eight months and then i

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.760 
seven 16s for eight months and then i
tried<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> half-inch<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> got<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
tried to go to half-inch and I got a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
tried to go to half-inch and I got a
blow<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.549> reason<00:01:24.030> why<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.390> blood<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
blow and the reason why I got blood is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
blow and the reason why I got blood is
because<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.409> used<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> taper<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> once<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> get

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
because I used to taper and once you get

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719 
because I used to taper and once you get
to<00:01:27.330> bigger<00:01:27.780> sizes<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.729> half-inch

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to bigger sizes like half-inch

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
to bigger sizes like half-inch
three-fourths<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.720> kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:30.990> stuff<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
three-fourths that kind of stuff you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
three-fourths that kind of stuff you
prop<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.400> recommend<00:01:32.549> using<00:01:32.970> papers

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
prop I would not recommend using papers

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
prop I would not recommend using papers
because<00:01:33.799> they're<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> best<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
because they're not the best for you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
because they're not the best for you
years<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.020> cause<00:01:37.200> blowouts

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
years and they are what cause blowouts

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
years and they are what cause blowouts
and<00:01:38.240> if<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.390> unsure<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and if you're unsure if you have a

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.240 
know it's hard I know you don't want to
downsize<00:03:29.260> because<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.829> just<00:03:30.010> went<00:03:30.190> through

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
downsize because you just went through

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.340 
downsize because you just went through
all<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.579> pain<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:31.030> get<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> next<00:03:31.930> size

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
all that pain to get to the next size

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.979 
all that pain to get to the next size
but<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.730> downsize<00:03:33.910> or<00:03:34.420> else<00:03:34.570> you'll

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
but you have to downsize or else you'll

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.310 
but you have to downsize or else you'll
run<00:03:35.739> along<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> lot<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.820> problems<00:03:37.269> later<00:03:38.230> on

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
run along a lot of problems later on

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.910 
run along a lot of problems later on
which<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.070> not<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.430> good<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:40.079> downsize<00:03:41.079> give<00:03:41.799> it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
which is not so good so downsize give it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.620 
which is not so good so downsize give it
about<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.100> week<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.549> half<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:43.239> two<00:03:43.269> weeks

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
about a week and a half to two weeks

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.410 
about a week and a half to two weeks
until<00:03:43.930> it's<00:03:44.170> fully<00:03:44.380> healed<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.269> if<00:03:46.269> you're

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
until it's fully healed and if you're

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.599 
until it's fully healed and if you're
planning<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.780> tapering<00:03:47.260> right<00:03:48.040> after<00:03:48.400> your

planning on tapering right after your
blowout<00:03:48.850> i<00:03:49.030> would<00:03:49.269> suggest<00:03:49.420> waiting<00:03:49.750> longer

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
blowout i would suggest waiting longer

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.870

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
taping probably over the course of two

taping probably over the course of two
to<00:03:54.100> three<00:03:54.280> weeks<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.820> half-inch<00:03:55.209> then<00:03:55.570> you

know i can start now it's been about two
there<00:03:58.870> are<00:03:58.989> three<00:03:59.230> weeks<00:03:59.410> actually<00:03:59.620> since<00:04:00.040> my

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
there are three weeks actually since my

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.599 
there are three weeks actually since my
blowout<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:02.230> thing<00:04:02.440> about<00:04:02.680> blowouts<00:04:03.310> and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
blowout and the thing about blowouts and

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.250 
blowout and the thing about blowouts and
healing<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.140> be

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
healing it is that you have to be

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.680 
healing it is that you have to be
persistent<00:04:05.440> with<00:04:05.920> your<00:04:06.910> cleaning<00:04:07.390> and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
persistent with your oil rubs and if

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.000 
persistent with your oil rubs and if
you're<00:04:10.269> not<00:04:10.390> then<00:04:10.840> it's<00:04:11.290> not<00:04:11.470> really<00:04:11.530> gonna

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
you're not then it's not really gonna

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.050 
you're not then it's not really gonna
get<00:04:12.160> fixed<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:14.019> have<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.260> downsize<00:04:15.060> they

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
get fixed and you have to downsize they

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.469 
get fixed and you have to downsize they
say<00:04:16.630> sometimes<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.200> downsize<00:04:17.560> two<00:04:17.829> sizes

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
say sometimes to downsize two sizes

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.550 
say sometimes to downsize two sizes
however<00:04:19.479> i<00:04:19.630> really<00:04:19.989> didn't<00:04:20.200> want<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.350> go<00:04:20.440> back

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
however i really didn't want to go back

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.080 
however i really didn't want to go back
to<00:04:20.620> double<00:04:21.010> zero<00:04:21.250> because<00:04:21.430> that's

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
to double zero because that's

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.930 
to double zero because that's
really<00:04:22.510> small<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.500> went<00:04:23.860> back<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.100> seven<00:04:24.460> 16s

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
really small so I went back to seven 16s

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.379 
really small so I went back to seven 16s
and<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.210> was<00:04:25.300> fine<00:04:25.480> also<00:04:26.350> when<00:04:27.100> you're<00:04:27.389> when

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
and it was fine also when you're when

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.450 
and it was fine also when you're when
you<00:04:28.510> just<00:04:28.720> recently<00:04:29.320> stretched<00:04:29.680> or<00:04:30.010> when<00:04:30.370> you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
you just recently stretched or when you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.830 
you just recently stretched or when you
have<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> blowout<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.210> you're<00:04:31.330> trying<00:04:31.479> to<00:04:31.630> heal

have a blowout and you're trying to heal
it<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.169> would<00:04:32.530> recommend<00:04:32.770> using<00:04:33.070> surgical

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
it I would recommend using surgical

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.659 
it I would recommend using surgical

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
acrylic because the acrylic is sometimes

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.450
