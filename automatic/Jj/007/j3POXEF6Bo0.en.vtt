00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
that's actually a pretty good point the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.359 
that's actually a pretty good point the
other<00:01:35.600> pretty<00:01:36.110> good<00:01:36.290> point<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:36.830> if<00:01:36.979> this

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
other pretty good point is that if this

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.789 
other pretty good point is that if this
isn't<00:01:37.700> enough<00:01:37.760> for<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.360> then<00:01:38.960> other<00:01:39.560> people

two<00:01:53.150> years<00:01:53.330> for<00:01:53.780> repairs<00:01:54.290> well<00:01:54.830> now<00:01:54.979> that's

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
two years for repairs well now that's

two years for repairs well now that's
been<00:01:55.430> repaired<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.299> they're<00:01:56.450> going<00:01:56.570> to

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
been repaired and they're going to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.730 
been repaired and they're going to
switch<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.990> on<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:57.259> they're<00:01:57.500> trying<00:01:57.710> to

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
switch it on because they're trying to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.620 
switch it on because they're trying to
find<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.040> parallel<00:01:58.460> universe<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.119> what<00:01:59.450> that's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
find a parallel universe and what that's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.760 
find a parallel universe and what that's
going<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.869> do<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.140> going<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.439> create<00:02:00.680> a

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
going to do is it's going to create a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.950 
going to do is it's going to create a
mini<00:02:01.070> black<00:02:01.310> hole<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.790> draw<00:02:02.329> asteroids

mini black hole and draw asteroids

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.109 
mini black hole and draw asteroids
towards<00:02:03.590> us<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.520> also<00:02:04.880> going<00:02:05.030> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
towards us and that's also going to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.120 
towards us and that's also going to
impact<00:02:05.420> again<00:02:05.810> around<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.170> magic<00:02:06.500> date<00:02:06.680> sep

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
impact again around this magic date sep

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.770 
impact again around this magic date sep
tember<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.610> 24th<00:02:09.640> well<00:02:10.640> they<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.000> not<00:02:11.569> turn

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
tember the 24th well they just not turn

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.480 
tember the 24th well they just not turn
it<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.080> then<00:02:12.349> because<00:02:12.739> they<00:02:12.860> were<00:02:12.980> they<00:02:13.099> doing

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
it on then because they were they doing

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.290 
it on then because they were they doing
experiments<00:02:14.210> yeah<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.110> then<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.300> prove

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
experiments yeah but then if you prove

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.720 
experiments yeah but then if you prove
yourself<00:02:17.660> right<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.380> know<00:02:18.920> going<00:02:19.220> anywhere

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
yourself right you know going anywhere

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.280 
yourself right you know going anywhere
from<00:02:19.820> there<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.120> mean<00:02:20.450> they<00:02:20.750> want<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.020> fight<00:02:21.200> if

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
from there I mean they want to fight if

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.990 
from there I mean they want to fight if
there's<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.500> parallel<00:02:21.770> universe<00:02:21.920> okay<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.700> find

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
there's a parallel universe okay I find

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.580 
there's a parallel universe okay I find
that<00:02:23.120> yeah<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.690> concern<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.410> going

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
that yeah they concern that that's going

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.320 
that yeah they concern that that's going
to<00:02:24.650> happen<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.040> they<00:02:25.100> saying<00:02:25.370> first<00:02:25.880> bloggers

to happen and they saying first bloggers
are<00:02:26.420> saying<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.780> CERN<00:02:27.020> logo<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.620> 666

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
are saying that the CERN logo is 666

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220 
are saying that the CERN logo is 666
which<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> sign<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.390> devil<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.020> there's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
which is a sign of the devil so there's

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.720 
which is a sign of the devil so there's
no<00:02:30.500> end<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:33.200> speculation<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.130> the

conspiracy theories about Jade helm 15

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.740 
conspiracy theories about Jade helm 15
remember<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:43.940> sure<00:02:44.270> they're<00:02:44.540> also

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
remember that one sure they're also

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
underlying reason for carrying out these

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.310 
underlying reason for carrying out these
maneuvers<00:02:49.730> these<00:02:49.850> special<00:02:50.320> operations

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
maneuvers these special operations

maneuvers these elite forces maneuvers
around<00:02:53.810> around<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.010> south<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.490> though

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
around around that the south and though

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.520 
around around that the south and though
and<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.910> west<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.390> country<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:57.020> to

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
and the west of the country is to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.770 
and the west of the country is to
prepare<00:02:58.040> for<00:02:58.370> when<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:59.030> meteorite<00:02:59.450> when

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
prepare for when this meteorite when

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.330 
prepare for when this meteorite when
this<00:02:59.870> asteroid<00:03:00.350> hits<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.860> answer<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.190> they

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
this asteroid hits the answer that they

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.130 
this asteroid hits the answer that they
are<00:03:01.430> ready<00:03:01.730> for<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.180> chaos<00:03:02.630> that's<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:03.080> to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
are ready for the chaos that's going to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.530 
are ready for the chaos that's going to
wince<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.530> yeah<00:03:04.070> well<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.330> reason

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
wince you yeah well I think the reason

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.080 
wince you yeah well I think the reason
especially<00:03:06.140> Texans<00:03:07.070> are<00:03:07.190> upset<00:03:07.550> about<00:03:07.580> this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
especially Texans are upset about this

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.110 
especially Texans are upset about this
is<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.780> got<00:03:08.840> them<00:03:09.410> turned<00:03:09.890> pink<00:03:10.310> it's

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
is that it's got them turned pink it's

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.060 
is that it's got them turned pink it's
they're<00:03:11.540> being<00:03:11.750> portrayed<00:03:12.110> as<00:03:12.200> pink<00:03:12.620> hair<00:03:12.920> and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
they're being portrayed as pink hair and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.640 
they're being portrayed as pink hair and
they're<00:03:13.970> not<00:03:14.120> gonna<00:03:14.240> stand<00:03:14.450> for<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.750> well

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
they're not gonna stand for that well

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.470 
they're not gonna stand for that well
that's<00:03:16.010> true<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.340> was<00:03:16.460> pink<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.820> one<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.240> one

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
that's true it was pink and one in one

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.730 
that's true it was pink and one in one
map<00:03:17.660> in<00:03:17.780> another<00:03:18.050> map<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:18.650> they

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
map in another map it's but they

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.430 
map in another map it's but they
identified<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.850> hostile<00:03:20.420> that's<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.260> point

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
identified as hostile that's the point

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.170 
identified as hostile that's the point
the<00:03:21.650> point<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.980> there<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.430> these<00:03:22.640> maneuvers

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
the point is there in these maneuvers

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.940 
the point is there in these maneuvers
they're<00:03:23.510> identified<00:03:23.960> as<00:03:24.080> hostile<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.800> know

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
they're identified as hostile you know

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.470 
they're identified as hostile you know
like<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.310> they<00:03:25.610> see<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.030> being<00:03:26.210> a

say<00:04:30.290> well<00:04:30.410> they<00:04:30.500> would<00:04:30.650> say<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.100> NASA<00:04:31.550> knows

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940
