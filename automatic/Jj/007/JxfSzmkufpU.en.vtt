not too long ago set bling release the
arm<00:00:03.300> temporal<00:00:04.259> bomb<00:00:04.470> it's<00:00:05.400> pretty<00:00:05.790> evil<00:00:06.240> when

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
arm temporal bomb it's pretty evil when

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.049 
arm temporal bomb it's pretty evil when
you<00:00:06.750> break<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.500> explodes<00:00:08.010> there's<00:00:08.849> one

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
you break it it explodes there's one

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.540 
you break it it explodes there's one
major<00:00:09.269> problem<00:00:09.990> though<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:11.400> be

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
major problem though is that can be

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.829 
major problem though is that can be
diffused<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> matter<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> seconds<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:14.839> minor

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
diffused in a matter of seconds a minor

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.340 
diffused in a matter of seconds a minor
adjustment<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.980> solve<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.430> problem<00:00:17.820> though

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
adjustment can solve the problem though

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.529 
adjustment can solve the problem though
one<00:00:19.350> possibility<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.279> changing<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> box<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
one possibility is changing the box of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.460 
one possibility is changing the box of
the<00:00:22.100> bomb<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.609> clothes<00:00:23.880> done<00:00:24.230> seeing<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the bomb with clothes done seeing as you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
the bomb with clothes done seeing as you
cannot<00:00:25.710> place<00:00:26.010> any<00:00:26.340> levers<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.789> glowstone<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
cannot place any levers on glowstone and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
cannot place any levers on glowstone and
glowstone<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> awesome<00:00:29.210> there's<00:00:30.210> still

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
glowstone is awesome there's still

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
glowstone is awesome there's still
problem<00:00:30.869> though<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.309> even<00:00:32.309> though<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
problem though because even though you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370 
problem though because even though you
cannot<00:00:32.790> place<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.110> still

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
cannot place it like that you can still

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.670 
cannot place it like that you can still
slowly<00:00:35.190> work<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:36.059> into<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.170> bomb<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
slowly work your way into the bomb and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.910 
slowly work your way into the bomb and
defuse<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:39.840> more<00:00:40.020> evil<00:00:40.590> but

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
defuse it so it's a bit more evil but

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.060 
defuse it so it's a bit more evil but
still<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.430> evil<00:00:42.120> enough<00:00:42.620> taking<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.010> step

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
still not evil enough taking it one step

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.299 
still not evil enough taking it one step
further<00:00:44.640> would<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.600> by<00:00:45.989> changing<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> box<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
further would be by changing the box of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.479 
further would be by changing the box of
the<00:00:47.550> bomb<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.539> clothes<00:00:48.840> down<00:00:49.110> lamps<00:00:49.559> seeing

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the bomb with clothes down lamps seeing

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.220 
the bomb with clothes down lamps seeing
is<00:00:50.760> whenever<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.390> power<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.140> lamp<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
is whenever you power a lamp it

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
is whenever you power a lamp it
activates<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.469> lamp<00:00:55.680> causing<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> block

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
activates the lamp causing a block

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
activates the lamp causing a block
update<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.960> there's<00:00:58.559> probably<00:00:58.980> still<00:00:59.370> ways

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
update now there's probably still ways

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.990 
update now there's probably still ways
you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.270> without<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.640> without<00:01:02.640> stuff

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you can do this without it without stuff

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320 
you can do this without it without stuff
breaking<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:04.350> again<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.430> directly<00:01:06.060> place

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
breaking but again if you directly place

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.990 
breaking but again if you directly place
a<00:01:06.600> lever<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.560> device<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> activate

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a lever on the device and you activate

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.350 
a lever on the device and you activate
it<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.330> blows<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.830> again<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.850> evil

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it it blows up so again it's more evil

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.050 
it it blows up so again it's more evil
but<00:01:12.780> still<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.650> still<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.070> quite<00:01:14.460> there

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
but still not still not quite there

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.950 
but still not still not quite there
and<00:01:16.070> that's<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> finally<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.390> now

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and that's when we finally get there now

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.010 
and that's when we finally get there now
it<00:01:19.229> becomes<00:01:19.530> truly<00:01:20.040> evil<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> mere<00:01:21.659> fact

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it becomes truly evil now the mere fact

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.649 
it becomes truly evil now the mere fact
of<00:01:22.320> touching<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.400> placing<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.939> block<00:01:24.240> next

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
of touching it or placing a block next

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.910 
of touching it or placing a block next
to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> device<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:26.130> cause<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.909> block<00:01:27.509> update

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
to the device will cause a block update

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
to the device will cause a block update
so<00:01:29.060> even<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> fact<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.630> placing<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> block

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so even the fact of placing a block

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.700 
so even the fact of placing a block
there<00:01:32.009> who<00:01:32.490> make<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.850> explode<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.079> no<00:01:34.439> more

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
there who make it explode so no more

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
there who make it explode so no more
tampering<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> untenable<00:01:36.000> bomb<00:01:36.509> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
tampering with the untenable bomb this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.700 
tampering with the untenable bomb this
one<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> truly<00:01:37.619> truly<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.850> temporal<00:01:39.750> us<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.530> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
one is truly truly on temporal us or so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.929 
one is truly truly on temporal us or so
I<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:43.250> even<00:01:44.250> though<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:44.610> pretty

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
I think but even though that's pretty

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.740 
I think but even though that's pretty
diabolical<00:01:45.890> it's<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.420> pure

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
diabolical it's not it's not the pure

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
diabolical it's not it's not the pure
essence<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> evil<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.060> step

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
essence of evil we can take it one step

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
essence of evil we can take it one step
further<00:01:51.770> one<00:01:52.770> step<00:01:53.159> beyond<00:01:54.530> first<00:01:55.530> off<00:01:55.860> we

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
further one step beyond first off we

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.480 
further one step beyond first off we
will<00:01:56.250> need<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.850> essence<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:58.009> saplings<00:01:59.009> on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
will need the essence of saplings on

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.710 
will need the essence of saplings on
temporal<00:02:00.210> bomb<00:02:00.420> design<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> bunch<00:02:01.590> of

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
temporal bomb design which is a bunch of

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.120 
temporal bomb design which is a bunch of
in<00:02:03.140> an<00:02:04.130> extended<00:02:04.610> state<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.480> as<00:02:06.350> soon<00:02:06.620> as<00:02:06.830> any

of the blocks next to them gets an

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.130 
of the blocks next to them gets an
update<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:10.070> whole<00:02:10.220> thing<00:02:10.580> retracts<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.570> if

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
update the whole thing retracts and if

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.260 
update the whole thing retracts and if
you<00:02:12.230> don't<00:02:12.380> have<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> mechanism<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.640> activate

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
you don't have a mechanism to activate

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.550 
you don't have a mechanism to activate
TNT<00:02:14.780> somehow<00:02:15.230> within<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.740> machine<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.300> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
TNT somehow within the machine you get a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.650 
TNT somehow within the machine you get a
gigantic<00:02:18.560> explosion<00:02:19.000> especially<00:02:20.000> seeing<00:02:20.480> is

gigantic explosion especially seeing is

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.160 
gigantic explosion especially seeing is
the<00:02:20.870> device<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:22.370> lot<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> lot<00:02:23.570> bigger<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.140> a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the device is a lot a lot bigger so a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.100 
the device is a lot a lot bigger so a
lot<00:02:24.320> more<00:02:24.440> room<00:02:24.620> for<00:02:24.650> TNT<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.490> stuff<00:02:26.110> now

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
lot more room for TNT and stuff now

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.050 
lot more room for TNT and stuff now
looking<00:02:27.740> again<00:02:27.980> at<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.400> casing<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
looking again at the casing of the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.720 
looking again at the casing of the
device<00:02:29.480> even<00:02:30.050> with<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> redstone<00:02:31.100> or<00:02:31.370> it's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
device even with the redstone or it's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.170 
device even with the redstone or it's
still<00:02:32.240> not<00:02:32.540> truly<00:02:33.230> evil<00:02:33.830> because<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.850> know

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
still not truly evil because if you know

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.060 
still not truly evil because if you know
it's<00:02:35.480> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.900> explode<00:02:36.260> when<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.800> touch<00:02:37.040> it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
it's going to explode when you touch it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.580 
it's going to explode when you touch it
you're<00:02:37.820> simply<00:02:38.060> going<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.570> not<00:02:38.810> touch<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
you're simply going to not touch it and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.820 
you're simply going to not touch it and
nothing's<00:02:40.370> ever<00:02:40.610> going<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.060> happen<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.230> to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
nothing's ever going to happen so to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.980 
nothing's ever going to happen so to
give<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.220> player<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.670> reason<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.360> touch<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.870> I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
give the player a reason to touch it I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.600 
give the player a reason to touch it I
came<00:02:45.110> up<00:02:45.380> with<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.620> little<00:02:45.830> blue<00:02:46.130> circuit

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
came up with this little blue circuit

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.310 
came up with this little blue circuit
which<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.180> get<00:02:47.300> placed<00:02:47.600> inside<00:02:48.140> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
which is going to get placed inside the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.980 
which is going to get placed inside the
device<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.820> sort<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.420> timing<00:02:50.870> mechanism

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
device it's a sort of a timing mechanism

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.040 
device it's a sort of a timing mechanism
and<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.710> runs<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.360> experimental<00:02:53.360> wireless

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
and it runs on experimental wireless

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.470 
and it runs on experimental wireless
redstone<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.760> guessing<00:02:55.760> some<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.360> guys

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
redstone and guessing some of you guys

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.990 
redstone and guessing some of you guys
seen<00:02:56.930> videos<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.560> already<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.760> can

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
seen videos of it already but I can

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.060 
seen videos of it already but I can
place<00:02:59.300> this<00:02:59.600> inside<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.470> device<00:03:00.770> and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
place this inside the device and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.820 
place this inside the device and
activate<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.790> from<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> outside<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.830> once

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
activate it from the outside and once

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.130 
activate it from the outside and once
activated<00:03:04.370> or<00:03:04.820> by<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.570> way<00:03:05.660> better<00:03:05.870> yet

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
activated or by the way better yet

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.530 
activated or by the way better yet
instead<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.680> me<00:03:06.860> activating<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.640> obviously

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
instead of me activating it obviously

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.660 
instead of me activating it obviously
let<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.900> player<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.590> want<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:10.070> blow<00:03:10.459> up

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
let the player that you want to blow up

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.000 
let the player that you want to blow up
activate<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.690> because<00:03:12.200> that's<00:03:12.350> more<00:03:12.620> that's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
activate it because that's more that's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.510 
activate it because that's more that's
more<00:03:13.100> evil<00:03:13.580> more<00:03:13.760> fun<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> when<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:15.920> activate

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
more evil more fun but when you activate

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.040 
more evil more fun but when you activate
it<00:03:16.550> when<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.850> gets<00:03:17.000> activated<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.720> going<00:03:17.900> to

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
it when it gets activated it's going to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.110 
it when it gets activated it's going to
drop<00:03:18.380> an<00:03:18.530> item<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.040> pressure<00:03:19.340> pad<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.940> as

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
drop an item on a pressure pad and as

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.140 
drop an item on a pressure pad and as
soon<00:03:20.450> as<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.660> despawn<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.830> five<00:03:22.100> minutes<00:03:22.520> then

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
soon as a despawn so five minutes then

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.840 
soon as a despawn so five minutes then
it's<00:03:23.360> going<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.660> explode

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
it's going to explode

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.820 
it's going to explode
so<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.000> gives<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.360> player<00:03:26.600> five<00:03:27.080> minutes<00:03:27.530> to

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
so that gives the player five minutes to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.340 
so that gives the player five minutes to
try<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.850> come<00:03:29.000> up<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.270> some<00:03:29.510> ingenious<00:03:29.959> way

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
try and come up with some ingenious way

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.050 
try and come up with some ingenious way
to<00:03:30.380> tamper<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> untempered<00:03:31.700> ball

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
to tamper with the untempered ball

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.479 
to tamper with the untempered ball
device<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.660> hopefully<00:03:33.620> blowing<00:03:34.010> himself<00:03:34.160> up

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
device and hopefully blowing himself up

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.940 
device and hopefully blowing himself up
in<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.730> process<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.320> sort<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.739> classic

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
in the process so it's sort of a classic

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.150 
in the process so it's sort of a classic
hero<00:03:37.640> versus<00:03:38.090> villain<00:03:38.510> scenario<00:03:39.500> where<00:03:39.860> you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
hero versus villain scenario where you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.690 
hero versus villain scenario where you
give<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.030> player<00:03:41.269> somewhat<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.989> chance<00:03:42.290> to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
give the player somewhat of a chance to

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.160 
give the player somewhat of a chance to
the<00:03:43.700> safest<00:03:44.150> build<00:03:44.420> or<00:03:44.720> whatever<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.050> hell

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
the safest build or whatever the hell

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.190 
the safest build or whatever the hell
he's<00:03:45.380> done

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
he's done

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.610 
he's done
but<00:03:48.200> yeah<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.190> here's<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.460> device<00:03:50.470> here<00:03:51.470> is

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
but yeah so here's the device here is

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.770 
but yeah so here's the device here is
the<00:03:51.860> transmitter<00:03:52.550> so<00:03:53.180> as<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:53.360> can<00:03:53.450> see<00:03:53.510> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the transmitter so as you can see the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.570 
the transmitter so as you can see the
boat<00:03:53.990> is<00:03:54.200> now<00:03:54.380> sort<00:03:54.710> of<00:03:54.800> jumping<00:03:55.160> up<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.460> down

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
boat is now sort of jumping up and down

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.670 
boat is now sort of jumping up and down
but<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.090> keeps<00:03:56.300> constantly<00:03:57.020> landing<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
but it keeps constantly landing on the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.820 
but it keeps constantly landing on the
pressure<00:03:57.920> pad<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.870> what's<00:04:00.470> going<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.740> happen

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
pressure pad and what's going to happen

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.250 
pressure pad and what's going to happen
is<00:04:01.190> as<00:04:01.340> soon<00:04:01.370> as<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.880> click<00:04:02.210> this<00:04:02.390> button<00:04:02.600> as<00:04:03.080> you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
is as soon as I click this button as you

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.220 
is as soon as I click this button as you
can<00:04:03.380> see<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:03.650> now<00:04:03.830> above<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.870> timing<00:04:05.870> stops

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
can see it's now above the timing stops

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.320 
can see it's now above the timing stops
and<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:07.010> has<00:04:07.130> spawned<00:04:07.520> an<00:04:07.700> item<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.240> it's

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
and it has spawned an item and it's

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.020 
and it has spawned an item and it's
landed<00:04:08.720> on<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.930> pressure<00:04:09.170> pad<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.800> this<00:04:10.790> is

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
landed on the pressure pad and this is

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.600 
landed on the pressure pad and this is
somewhat<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.600> monostable<00:04:11.990> circuit<00:04:12.770> so<00:04:13.190> as

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
somewhat of a monostable circuit so as

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.599 
somewhat of a monostable circuit so as
soon<00:04:13.940> as<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:15.530> item<00:04:15.860> disappears

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
soon as the the item disappears

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.550 
soon as the the item disappears
that's<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.239> torch<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.720> going<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.049> activate<00:04:18.500> I

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
that's that torch is going to activate I

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.890 
that's that torch is going to activate I
can<00:04:18.829> actually<00:04:18.950> show<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.640> by<00:04:19.910> grabbing<00:04:20.690> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
can actually show it by grabbing the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.580 
can actually show it by grabbing the
item<00:04:21.580> activated<00:04:22.600> activates<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.780> TNT<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.500> the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
item activated activates the TNT and the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
item activated activates the TNT and the
whole<00:04:24.830> thing<00:04:25.160> blows<00:04:25.790> up<00:04:26.860> now<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.220> other<00:04:28.340> thing

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
whole thing blows up now the other thing

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.750 
whole thing blows up now the other thing
is<00:04:28.820> for<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.540> whole<00:04:29.660> casing<00:04:30.370> because<00:04:31.370> as<00:04:31.580> soon

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
is for the whole casing because as soon

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.330 
is for the whole casing because as soon
as<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.210> touch<00:04:32.840> this<00:04:33.170> this<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.800> all<00:04:33.950> going<00:04:34.130> to

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
as you touch this this is all going to

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.240 
as you touch this this is all going to
retract<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.440> still<00:04:36.710> need<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:36.950> way<00:04:37.190> to

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
retract but you still need a way to

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.540 
retract but you still need a way to
activate<00:04:37.970> TNT<00:04:38.660> when<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.020> happens<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:40.430> do

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
activate TNT when it happens and to do

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.430 
activate TNT when it happens and to do
that<00:04:40.730> I<00:04:40.970> simply<00:04:41.570> have<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.560> little<00:04:43.220> device<00:04:43.520> here

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that I simply have a little device here

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.000 
that I simply have a little device here
what<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:45.560> get<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.490> have<00:04:46.610> TNT<00:04:47.150> there<00:04:47.390> and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
what you get is you have TNT there and

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.340 
what you get is you have TNT there and
as<00:04:49.010> soon<00:04:49.190> as<00:04:49.610> any<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.510> blocks<00:04:50.720> next<00:04:51.230> that

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
as soon as any of the blocks next that

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.400 
as soon as any of the blocks next that
this<00:04:51.560> one<00:04:51.800> gets<00:04:52.640> updated<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.900> gets<00:04:54.110> shoved

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
this one gets updated that gets shoved

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.130 
this one gets updated that gets shoved
in<00:04:54.680> there<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.640> whole<00:04:55.820> thing<00:04:56.180> blows<00:04:56.930> up

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.430 

now<00:05:00.980> all<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.550> has<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.760> be<00:05:02.000> done<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.570> fit<00:05:03.020> in<00:05:03.050> as

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
now all it has to be done is fit in as

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.540 
now all it has to be done is fit in as
much<00:05:03.740> tea<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.370> tea<00:05:04.640> as<00:05:04.880> possible<00:05:05.770> then<00:05:06.770> shove

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
much tea and tea as possible then shove

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.160 
much tea and tea as possible then shove
that<00:05:07.850> inside<00:05:08.570> set<00:05:09.020> blinks<00:05:10.300> casing<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.480> then

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
that inside set blinks casing and then

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.990 
that inside set blinks casing and then
shove<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:13.040> in<00:05:13.310> my<00:05:14.090> redstone<00:05:14.600> or<00:05:15.080> casing<00:05:15.650> and

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
shove that in my redstone or casing and

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.540 
shove that in my redstone or casing and
there<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.150> have<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.390> truly<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.560> most<00:05:18.920> evil

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
there you have it truly the most evil

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.980 
there you have it truly the most evil
device<00:05:20.020> diabolical<00:05:21.020> device<00:05:21.170> ever<00:05:21.620> made
