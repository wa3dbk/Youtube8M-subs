tortoises<00:01:21.020> by<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.530> bright<00:01:21.830> yellow<00:01:21.860> cheek

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
tortoises by that bright yellow cheek

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.890 
tortoises by that bright yellow cheek
which<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:23.030> see<00:01:23.180> in<00:01:23.300> this<00:01:23.450> video<00:01:23.720> clip

here

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.660 

so<00:01:28.930> those<00:01:29.110> are<00:01:29.260> two<00:01:29.290> different<00:01:29.470> locales<00:01:30.070> mmm

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
so those are two different locales mmm

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.060 
so those are two different locales mmm
Sicily<00:01:31.150> yellow<00:01:31.659> dots<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.260> this<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.620> Tuscany

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
Sicily yellow dots and this is Tuscany

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.770 
Sicily yellow dots and this is Tuscany
with<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> red<00:01:33.520> dot<00:01:35.190> perfect<00:01:39.300> so<00:01:40.300> what<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
with the red dot perfect so what is that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.890 
with the red dot perfect so what is that
right<00:01:40.990> now<00:01:41.340> 25<00:01:42.340> 30<00:01:42.610> grams<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.540> one<00:01:43.690> on<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
right now 25 30 grams the one on the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.050 
right now 25 30 grams the one on the
left<00:01:44.260> probably<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.950> haven't<00:01:45.790> weighed<00:01:45.880> them

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
left probably I haven't weighed them

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.170 
left probably I haven't weighed them
where<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.479> they<00:01:46.570> start<00:01:46.780> off<00:01:46.990> at<00:01:47.200> about

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
where do they start off at about

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.420 
where do they start off at about
sometimes<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:50.290> I<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.530> hatched<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.250> hatched

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
sometimes there I I hatched I hatched

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:07.980 
sometimes there I I hatched I hatched
one<00:01:51.759> once<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.180> was<00:01:52.360> 9<00:01:52.540> grams<00:02:06.990> she's

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
one once that was 9 grams she's

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.550
