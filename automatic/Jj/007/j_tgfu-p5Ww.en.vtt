00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.640
 hello to my beginner aquarist 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.970
 and as well as the audience of this video with 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.280
 Uncle Vasya and today we talk about 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.500
 how to change the water in the aquarium 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.270
 for this we need either such 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.509
 all flashlight 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.100
 with pomp and with a bucket or if you 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.100
 large aquarium volume 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 then of course it is more convenient to hose it all 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.079
 merge so let's start the water change in 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.749
 aquarium still guys i advise 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:51.320
 use this nozzle here 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:52.699
 removed see yes what is it cool 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.670
 she is very comfortable 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.539
 Soil to sew and therefore raise 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.530
 all the dirt start siphon kick soil 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:08.060
 what are we doing we already dad swung the water 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.869
 I went and think about such movements 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:17.750
 we plow the ground as you can see yes everything to tailoring 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.340
 all the dirt she goes to us in a bucket all 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.759
 priming 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.590
 back see the earth then 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.180
 there is very comfortable very cool when 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.909
 the soil comes back and dirty water 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.780
 merges in general with such simple ones 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.799
 movements we go around the aquarium 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.439
 siphon our soil where free thereby 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.619
 pick up dirt and normal soil 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.799
 stays with us in the aquarium 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.759
 such procedures I do once 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.009
 week also in return here is the water that i 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.640
 I drain I refill fresh neat 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.850
 Vodichku nose under the tap can not be afraid 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.149
 if you keep the usual lively childbirth 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.280
 for example already leaving the fisherman also here 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.619
 I have labyrinths 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 all those fish that are not really 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.250
 demanding water quality temperatures 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.270
 water you can drop a little water to him 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.210
 There is if of course you have some water 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.670
 the foot is cooler then top up 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.300
 in parts, that is, not to be sharp 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.520
 lowering the water temperature also guys 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.360
 I this day yet I wash my sponge 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.460
 the filter thus still cleansing 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.910
 filter material and of course 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.580
 the fish will thank you for it 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.370
