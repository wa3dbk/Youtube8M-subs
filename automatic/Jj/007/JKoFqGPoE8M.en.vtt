00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.840
 hello how is my dearest brother of 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.850
 youtube I hope you are very well and without 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.960
 waste more time because the story of 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.960
 the week is about 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.650
 the story of the week is about 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 is related to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.200
 I can not 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.140
 I can not for the simple fact that a 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.870
 motive is worrying me and in fact 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.670
 I really hope you understand me as 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.380
 you will know I've been making videos 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.750
 for youtube for some time now 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.600
 with the sole intention of making them laugh 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.309
 or cheer them one a day if they had it and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.739
 if they have any problems that they forget 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.970
 of that problem for a moment but 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.280
 this time I just can not and I 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.290
 I will take these minutes to make known 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.300
 in the situation where I am or 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.980
 better said in the situation that we 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.310
 we found many of the students 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.700
 University students also make known the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 petitions and concerns that we have to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 through this good means ends up in the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 national university of loja in which 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.150
 I study electronics and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.930
 telecommunications suddenly and without 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.090
 notice 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.940
 they closed 11 races in mention 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.799
 including mine what does this mean 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.010
 this means that in the system 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.259
 National leveling Admission 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.270
 National university of the leaf is not 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.789
 offering these eleven closed races 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.159
 among the affected careers we have the 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.450
 bank and finance engineering 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.909
 public administration social work 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.369
 management and environment management systems and 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.890
 electronics and telecommunications as well 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.000
 of the language degrees and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.240
 psycho educational computer literature 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.640
 rehabilitation clinical laboratory and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.549
 clinical psychology how can you give 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.550
 understand we are many students 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.190
 affected with this decision the decision 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 of closing the races has created many 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.050
 concerns that to this day are not 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.240
 have been clarified under what arguments 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.670
 they have proceeded to close these races 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.380
 what will happen to the students of the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.750
 first cycles that lead to losing a 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.760
 module that alternative will be given the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.530
 graduate students of colleges 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.750
 who want to follow some of these 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.390
 careers 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.220
 and even more important that will happen with 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.070
 the careers that are in the process of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.820
 accreditation since there is not an answer 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.340
 official and nobody has pronounced 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.380
 firmly on these questions 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.810
 we have taken peaceful measures to 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.630
 look for an answer by calling 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.050
 attention from local media creating 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.870
 viral campaigns on the internet taking 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.720
 meetings and among colleagues doing 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.060
 student mobilizations with the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.310
 only reason to be clarified 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.830
 our doubts since there has not been a 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.200
 official pronouncement this has generated 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.080
 endless rumors among the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.420
 students that go from the closing 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 final of these races 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.819
 the careers that are in the process of 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.060
 accreditation will be in nothingness ever 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.430
 will re-open these 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.530
 careers lack of response only 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.110
 has generated fear and doubt among 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.270
 students creating an idea in the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.790
 head that all the sacrifice that 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.640
 we have done to get ahead is in 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.430
 vain than all those unveiled that 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.190
 you spent studying, they will not do any good 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.590
 that all the times you refused to 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.500
 go out with your family with your friends with 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.200
 your colleagues to stay studying for 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.290
 well achieve your goal that is 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.660
 be a great professional will never yield 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.709
 its fruits this video is not about 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.410
 reproach anything or accuse anyone this 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.360
 video tries to find the solution to 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.360
 the various questions that we have 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.970
 that we are heard to be given 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.209
 answers and if there is any problem 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.269
 give us a solution and if there is not one 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.400
 solution find the way or ways 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.490
 to find her work together 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.370
 because university are not only the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.370
 teachers or only the authorities or 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.420
 only university students 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.730
 we are all 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.680
 and we must work so that our 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.080
 university go ahead 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.259
 I hope this video reaches businessmen 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.150
 political students authorities that 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:50.270
 get to someone who can get their hands on 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.270
 this matter to ask you for favor 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.810
 do not let that take away close 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.610
 Thank you
