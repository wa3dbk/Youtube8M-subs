all these good toys okay let's do the
pine<00:00:36.300> tree<00:00:36.719> okay<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.579> these<00:00:38.879> pine

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
pine tree okay here we have these pine

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.530 
pine tree okay here we have these pine
trees<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> pine<00:00:41.940> tree<00:00:42.270> look

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
trees and when you do the pine tree look

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.190 
trees and when you do the pine tree look
outside<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.410> window<00:00:43.760> pine<00:00:44.760> tree<00:00:45.180> usually<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
outside the window pine tree usually is

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.369 
outside the window pine tree usually is
a<00:00:46.230> straight<00:00:46.950> stick<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.570> one

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
a straight stick then one and one

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.729 
a straight stick then one and one
cluster<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.280> branches<00:00:53.719> da-da-da-da-da<00:00:54.739> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
cluster of branches da-da-da-da-da and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.880 
cluster of branches da-da-da-da-da and
do<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:57.390> simple<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.230> something<00:00:58.680> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
do it really simple do something like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.110 
do it really simple do something like
this<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.000> build<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.440> sense<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
this so that you build up the sense of

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.320 
this so that you build up the sense of
direction<00:01:03.229> our<00:01:05.330> construction<00:01:06.330> yes<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.830> not

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
direction our construction yes do not

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
direction our construction yes do not
think<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:11.310> light<00:01:11.810> shade<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.490> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
think about the light shade and the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.789 
think about the light shade and the
needle<00:01:14.939> directions<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.680> about

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
needle directions do not think about

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.810 
needle directions do not think about
that<00:01:17.100> too<00:01:17.549> much<00:01:17.580> at<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> beginning<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.820> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that too much at the beginning and this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.359 
that too much at the beginning and this
is<00:01:21.030> another<00:01:21.299> photonic<00:01:22.229> joint<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.159> not

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
is another photonic joint you do not

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.170 
is another photonic joint you do not
need<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:23.970> too<00:01:24.360> accurate<00:01:24.979> let's<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.189> have

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
need to be too accurate let's just have

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.950 
need to be too accurate let's just have
fun<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.810> make<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.630> my

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
fun and make it right so you can see my

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
fun and make it right so you can see my
my<00:01:31.740> hand<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.579> always<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.030> clean

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
my hand is always it's not a clean

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.480 
my hand is always it's not a clean
stroke<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:38.009> clean<00:01:38.460> straw<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
stroke is not a clean straw like this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.480 
stroke is not a clean straw like this
it's<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.820> connected<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:43.140> connected<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's all connected more connected so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.870 
it's all connected more connected so
when<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.880> tree

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
when the to the when you see the tree

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
when the to the when you see the tree
branch<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.770> pine<00:01:50.070> tree<00:01:50.659> all<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.259> needles

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
branch the the pine tree all the needles

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.560 
branch the the pine tree all the needles
are<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:54.090> layering<00:01:55.020> after<00:01:55.920> layer<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
are actually layering after layer and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
are actually layering after layer and
overlapping<00:01:57.570> each<00:01:57.960> other<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.829> real<00:01:59.100> effect

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
overlapping each other the real effect

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.109 
overlapping each other the real effect
is<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.969> make<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:05.100> lazy<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.909> be

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is like this so make so be lazy don't be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.760 
is like this so make so be lazy don't be
true<00:02:06.479> accurate<00:02:07.229> okay

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
true accurate okay

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.930 
true accurate okay
I<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:10.160> good<00:02:10.400> return<00:02:11.060> for<00:02:11.740> sorry<00:02:12.740> yes<00:02:13.430> so

traitor and do some very this kind of
you<00:02:34.280> know<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.730> pine<00:02:35.090> trees<00:02:35.570> all<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.520> year

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
you know the pine trees all the year

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.630 
you know the pine trees all the year
after<00:02:37.730> years<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:39.320> has<00:02:40.180> descanses<00:02:41.200> right

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
after years of it has descanses right

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.890 
after years of it has descanses right
still<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:43.910> not<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> very<00:02:45.040> very<00:02:46.040> very

realistic like it is actually not at all
realistic<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:52.960> impressive<00:02:54.370> impression<00:02:55.510> is

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
realistic but impressive impression is

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.510 
realistic but impressive impression is
not<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.970> impressionist<00:02:58.970> I<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:01.430> Miss<00:03:02.500> yes

not this impressionist I so Miss yes
they<00:03:04.520> are<00:03:04.550> quite<00:03:04.940> balanced<00:03:05.720> do<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.470> want<00:03:06.740> it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
they are quite balanced do you want it

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.260 
they are quite balanced do you want it
is<00:03:07.220> no<00:03:07.430> balance<00:03:07.700> I've<00:03:08.540> not<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.490> won't<00:03:10.490> make<00:03:10.850> some

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
is no balance I've not I won't make some

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.560 
is no balance I've not I won't make some
place<00:03:11.570> more<00:03:12.350> let's<00:03:12.800> get<00:03:13.100> here<00:03:15.790> twenty<00:03:16.790> we<00:03:17.390> do

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
place more let's get here twenty we do

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.970 
place more let's get here twenty we do
not<00:03:17.780> make<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.220> advanced<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:20.300> part<00:03:20.660> move<00:03:21.410> just

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
not make it advanced this part move just

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.120 
not make it advanced this part move just
to<00:03:22.160> be<00:03:22.580> brave<00:03:22.970> enough<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.810> continue<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.770> do<00:03:24.950> it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
to be brave enough and continue to do it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:04:11.950 
to be brave enough and continue to do it
let's<00:03:25.850> make<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.390> one<00:03:26.660> law

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.920 

yeah<00:04:12.830> okay<00:04:13.310> there's<00:04:13.580> no<00:04:13.910> man<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.450> can<00:04:14.690> finish

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
yeah okay there's no man you can finish

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.980 
yeah okay there's no man you can finish
this<00:04:15.380> painted<00:04:15.950> right<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:17.030> can<00:04:17.240> always<00:04:17.510> add

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:17.990 
this painted right you can always add

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.920 
this painted right you can always add
something<00:04:18.440> but<00:04:19.190> this<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.520> roughly<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.180> idea

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
something but this is roughly the idea

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
something but this is roughly the idea
of<00:04:21.200> doing<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.930> know<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.440> roughly

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
of doing it and you know the roughly

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.810 
of doing it and you know the roughly
structure<00:04:25.670> of<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.330> needle<00:04:27.340> pine<00:04:28.340> needle

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
structure of the needle pine needle

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.060 
structure of the needle pine needle
there<00:04:29.240> are<00:04:29.390> several<00:04:29.630> kinds<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.320> pine<00:04:30.620> needle

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
there are several kinds of pine needle

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.200 
there are several kinds of pine needle
right<00:04:31.370> some<00:04:32.180> are<00:04:32.420> all<00:04:32.740> only<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:34.100> way<00:04:34.370> we<00:04:35.030> will

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
right some are all only this way we will

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.830 
right some are all only this way we will
do<00:04:35.390> another<00:04:35.420> one<00:04:35.990> only<00:04:36.470> this<00:04:36.680> way<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:38.540> it's

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
do another one only this way and it's

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.920 
do another one only this way and it's
only<00:04:40.480> this<00:04:41.480> week<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.880> this<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.060> from<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.630> side

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
only this week and this is from the side

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.380 
only this week and this is from the side
you<00:04:45.290> see<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:45.920> from<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.790> front<00:04:47.120> is

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
you see it and from the front is

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.200 
you see it and from the front is
actually<00:04:47.840> one<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.830> this<00:04:49.100> direction<00:04:51.370> one<00:04:52.370> part

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
actually one in this direction one part

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.500 
actually one in this direction one part
of<00:04:53.360> needle<00:04:53.870> front<00:04:54.140> for<00:04:54.620> this<00:04:54.800> direction<00:04:55.510> okay

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
of needle front for this direction okay

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.560 
of needle front for this direction okay
we<00:04:56.720> will<00:04:56.840> do<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.260> kind<00:04:57.620> later<00:04:58.040> but<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:59.060> one

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
we will do this kind later but this one

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.530 
we will do this kind later but this one
is<00:04:59.810> something<00:05:00.650> like<00:05:03.370> yes<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.400> kind<00:05:05.030> of<00:05:05.180> pine

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
is something like yes this kind of pine

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.930 
is something like yes this kind of pine
needle<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.200> there<00:05:06.770> are<00:05:06.890> other<00:05:07.100> kind<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.670> pine

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
needle and there are other kind of pine

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:16.750 
needle and there are other kind of pine
needle<00:05:12.610> complete<00:05:14.110> will<00:05:15.110> do<00:05:15.410> those<00:05:16.040> different

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
needle complete will do those different

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.280 
needle complete will do those different
kinds<00:05:17.180> in<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.960> separator<00:05:18.560> okay<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:20.080> be<00:05:21.080> free

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
kinds in the separator okay so be free

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.860 
kinds in the separator okay so be free
be<00:05:21.770> free<00:05:21.980> and<00:05:23.230> knowing<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.590> main<00:05:25.870> structure

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
be free and knowing the main structure

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.980 
be free and knowing the main structure
of<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.560> pine<00:05:27.830> tree<00:05:28.160> a<00:05:28.370> stick<00:05:28.940> with<00:05:29.330> several

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
of the pine tree a stick with several

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.880 
of the pine tree a stick with several
branches<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:31.180> then<00:05:32.180> put<00:05:32.510> on<00:05:32.690> leave<00:05:32.900> so

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
branches and then put on leave so

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.420 
branches and then put on leave so
actually<00:05:34.730> it's<00:05:35.270> like<00:05:36.010> make<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.900> no<00:05:38.900> claws<00:05:39.430> make

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
actually it's like make it no claws make

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.020 
actually it's like make it no claws make
it<00:05:40.640> neck<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.570> winter<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.140> winter<00:05:42.470> tree<00:05:43.190> with

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
it neck the winter to winter tree with

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.020 
it neck the winter to winter tree with
no<00:05:44.390> lease<00:05:44.660> and<00:05:45.080> then<00:05:45.620> you<00:05:45.770> slowly<00:05:46.100> put<00:05:46.610> in<00:05:46.820> de

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
no lease and then you slowly put in de

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.330 
no lease and then you slowly put in de
lis<00:05:47.560> I'm<00:05:48.560> speaking<00:05:49.070> too<00:05:49.250> much

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340
