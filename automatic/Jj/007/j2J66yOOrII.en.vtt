00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.890
 I have to admit football does not 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.510
 interested too much I do not know anything about 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.980
 tactics I only know a few 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.930
 players and I find it more interesting 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 theoretical physics to understand in what 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.240
 is an offside game this is the 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.950
 line placed parallel to the cut of 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.539
 grass 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.420
 sometimes we put it now it's parallel to the 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 center of the field 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.900
 to standing inside this door campus 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 very badly done for that you will understand that 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.290
 when my roommate will be 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.140
 every year 70 euros in the nth version 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 of fifa treat him like an imbecile there 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 that recognize that those of jay have created 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
 an almost perfect simulation with only 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.239
 four buttons to pass and pull and the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 two joysticks to make the dribbles the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 fifa manages to simulate almost any 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.790
 situation that can happen in a field of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.910
 football graphics and animations 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.890
 they are more realistic each year and play well 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.780
 the game requires a skill worthy of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.780
 the hack and slash desplat and names 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.149
 some people 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.710
 year after year the fifa comes out rife with 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.399
 exploits ebooks that fixes the year 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.840
 next without parameter other different 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.119
 I'm not going to cheat on me the fifa has 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.250
 helped a lot but one day everything changed 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.319
 it was the day to discover the conspiracy 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.539
 judeomasÃ³nica that exists behind a 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.399
 game of kicking a ball and 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.409
 discover the market of fifa ultimate 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.000
 team I started to work and find the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.500
 true incentive to play fifa 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 I found my true self 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.170
 come on 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.190
 and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.190
 we use the so-called as 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.510
 do not 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.240
 money money money money money 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.240
 money money money 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.619
 fixed ultimate team is a game mode 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.900
 in which the players are like trading cards 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.250
 every game you play you receive a 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.470
 Number of coins as you win or lose 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 and with the coins you can buy envelopes 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.820
 in which you played players 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 randomized the key to the game is that 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.680
 every ronaldo Christian there are hundreds of 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.450
 thousands of fucking players 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.450
 and if I do not find out 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.950
 with which it is almost impossible to make a 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.230
 good team buying yale envelopes 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.970
 the grandmother arrives now ultimate team 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.680
 has a market in which as if it were 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.210
 a school yard people exchange 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.070
 his cards of players for those of others 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.570
 player prices fluctuate 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.580
 depending on how popular they are between 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.960
 people who play the fifa and good as you 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.180
 can you imagine the players more 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.819
 popular pass from costing some coins to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.890
 several million 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.269
 very soon in the game you realize 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.650
 that to make a good team you're going to 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.510
 need much more than learning to 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.189
 Enjoy strong or bargain 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.500
 Hope this better explains it to you 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:04.560
 Manuel is awake at once 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.470
 if you are not inside you are outside you understand 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.810
 and I do not talk about 400 thousand dollars a year 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.500
 win in 'wall street' travel first 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.190
 and live well 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.820
 I talk about being very rich 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.790
 so rich that you have your own reactor 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:23.060
 so rich that you do not waste time talked 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.260
 of 50 of 100 million dollars 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.129
 or millionaire 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.129
 or nothing 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.400
 be a millionaire that was my goal from 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.040
 the first day and it was not an easy goal 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.600
 I had to do my homework because 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.160
 just as it happens with the bag to win or 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.020
 lose in the ultimate team market 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.020
 it depends on being well informed 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.720
 the first step is to forget about guides or 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.180
 of alleged tips from people with 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.830
 thousands of followers on twitter there is no 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.319
 miracle formulas neither trade that 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.420
 they always work to get rich in the 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.840
 fifa depends on getting ahead of the market 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.069
 It depends on buying cheap and selling expensive 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.989
 It depends on having more information than 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.660
 nobody before anyone and to have the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.420
 money and the balls to risk it if 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.500
 you are going to work soccer is your bible there 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.180
 you have the prices of all 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.830
 players to the minute you can see how 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930
 fluctuate and buy them always when 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.910
 they are cheaper but to what players 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.560
 I had to buy as I said no 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.209
 I have no idea about football so I had to 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.290
 look for my particulars at 100 cent 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.510
 rating 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.669
 the tobalina channel and the pages if 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.560
 fantastic and everything is ultimate team 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.210
 they turned me into fitch and moody's and 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.860
 standard and poor's 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.630
 there I was looking for the most popular players 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.840
 of the game and I dedicated myself to work with 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.840
 they 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.740
 little by little I was understanding the rules 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.940
 of supply and demand 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.199
 he always bought during the week and sold 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.849
 on weekends when there was more 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.710
 people changed to the players of 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.630
 position to sell them more expensive and 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.580
 never never set above the price 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.650
 maximum that I indicated jogging 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.240
 I had gains and losses but I ended up 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.770
 multiplying the amount of coins that 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.820
 I got to my partner's bank 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.230
 floor 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.510
 Serious as you fail, that's terrible 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.640
 I soon started working with reports 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.190
 with cards hands of mats and even tried 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.170
 some totti radiated with the upgrades 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.120
 radiated with Irish for the tournament 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.070
 Saint Patrick dealt with changes of 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.780
 Clinical styles position everything 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.850
 It fell into my hands and within a few weeks 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.760
 he had already raised several million without 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.670
 too much difficulty however I know that 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.960
 now it's hard to keep 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.850
 especially when you catch the retarded 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.250
 of your flatmate buying on 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.280
 those hidden but what are you doing buying 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.940
 envelopes or mongolo looks at the bitch 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.940
 shit that has come out
