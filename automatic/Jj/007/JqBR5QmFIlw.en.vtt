pipe to this stand that wasn't very
great<00:02:10.340> plain<00:02:10.760> device<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:11.240> oh<00:02:11.330> well<00:02:11.980> anyway

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
great plain device but oh well anyway

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.260 
great plain device but oh well anyway
the<00:02:13.520> connector<00:02:13.970> looks<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.880> guy<00:02:17.060> right

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
the connector looks like this guy right

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.360 
the connector looks like this guy right
here<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:18.010> would<00:02:19.010> call<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.220> t<00:02:19.550> connector<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:21.370> on

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
here I would call it t connector and on

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.870 
here I would call it t connector and on
these<00:02:22.610> trusses<00:02:23.000> they<00:02:23.360> really<00:02:23.630> suck<00:02:24.760> some<00:02:25.760> of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
these trusses they really suck some of

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.940 
these trusses they really suck some of
us<00:02:26.000> are<00:02:26.210> trying<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.690> leave<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.470> connector

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
us are trying to leave this connector

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.300 
us are trying to leave this connector
mounted<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.350> stands<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> two<00:02:30.620> stands<00:02:31.130> and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
mounted to the stands the two stands and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.300 
mounted to the stands the two stands and
then<00:02:31.930> try<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.960> put<00:02:33.200> our<00:02:33.410> two<00:02:33.680> pipes<00:02:33.950> from<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
then try to put our two pipes from the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.310 
then try to put our two pipes from the
trusses<00:02:34.850> into<00:02:35.150> these<00:02:35.300> when<00:02:35.840> we're<00:02:35.960> sitting<00:02:36.200> up

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
trusses into these when we're sitting up

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.010 
trusses into these when we're sitting up
for<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> gig<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.270> some<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.420> us<00:02:38.540> are<00:02:38.810> leaving

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
for a gig and some of us are leaving

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.590 
for a gig and some of us are leaving
these<00:02:39.350> attached<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.670> tent<00:02:40.850> but<00:02:41.030> trust<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
these attached to the tent but trust and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.060 
these attached to the tent but trust and
then<00:02:41.810> trying<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.200> mount<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.770> stand

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
then trying to mount that on the stand

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.740 
then trying to mount that on the stand
either<00:02:43.370> way<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.820> sucks<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.390> these<00:02:44.600> are

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
either way it sucks because these are

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.190 
either way it sucks because these are
plastic<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.370> have<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.780> loosen<00:02:47.780> up<00:02:48.020> before

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
plastic and you have to loosen up before

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.920 
plastic and you have to loosen up before
you<00:02:48.560> can<00:02:48.710> put<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.670> pull<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.630> then

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you can put the pull in and then

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.650 
you can put the pull in and then
sometimes<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.530> loosens<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:52.070> bold<00:02:52.670> but<00:02:53.000> this

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
sometimes it loosens up bold but this

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.910 
sometimes it loosens up bold but this
isn't<00:02:53.960> loosen<00:02:54.200> us<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.680> stick<00:02:54.890> a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
isn't loosen us you have to stick a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.710 
isn't loosen us you have to stick a
screwdriver<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.580> there<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.880> try<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> loosen<00:02:56.510> up

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
screwdriver in there to try to loosen up

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.150 
screwdriver in there to try to loosen up
some<00:02:56.870> more<00:02:57.020> sand<00:02:57.260> get<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.380> stupid<00:02:57.650> pipe<00:02:57.980> in

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
some more sand get the stupid pipe in

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.840 
some more sand get the stupid pipe in
there<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.040> sometimes<00:03:01.520> when<00:03:01.730> you're

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
there and then sometimes when you're

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.980 
there and then sometimes when you're
trying<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.060> loosen<00:03:02.270> this<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.600> because<00:03:02.750> they

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
trying to loosen this up because they

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.699 
trying to loosen this up because they
make<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.350> stupid<00:03:03.890> bolt<00:03:04.070> too<00:03:04.250> short<00:03:05.709> you

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
make the stupid bolt too short you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.230 
make the stupid bolt too short you
trying<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.980> get<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.190> loose<00:03:07.700> enough<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.090> get<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
trying to get it loose enough to get the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.970 
trying to get it loose enough to get the
pipe<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.570> there<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.500> not<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.860> other

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
pipe in there and but not on the other

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.800 
pipe in there and but not on the other
since<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.120> other<00:03:11.270> set<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.510> bolt

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
since this on the other set is bolt

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.260 
since this on the other set is bolt
falls<00:03:12.050> off<00:03:12.310> if<00:03:13.310> you're<00:03:13.489> outside<00:03:13.610> then<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.090> guess

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
falls off if you're outside then I guess

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.760 
falls off if you're outside then I guess
that's<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.600> grass<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.200> good<00:03:15.410> luck<00:03:15.560> finding

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
that's in the grass so good luck finding

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.760 
that's in the grass so good luck finding
it<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:17.020> when<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.110> have<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.320> deal<00:03:18.350> with<00:03:18.500> cold

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
it and when you have to deal with cold

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.410 
it and when you have to deal with cold
weather<00:03:19.010> like<00:03:19.220> idea<00:03:19.580> over<00:03:19.790> here<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.000> Utah<00:03:20.300> on

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
weather like idea over here in Utah on

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.210 
weather like idea over here in Utah on
the<00:03:20.480> winners<00:03:20.800> then<00:03:21.800> you're<00:03:21.920> worried<00:03:22.160> about

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
the winners then you're worried about

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.660 
the winners then you're worried about
the<00:03:22.430> plastic<00:03:22.940> cracking<00:03:24.100> because<00:03:25.100> maybe<00:03:25.459> it's

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
the plastic cracking because maybe it's

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.660 
the plastic cracking because maybe it's
been<00:03:25.790> out<00:03:25.910> in<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.720> vehicle<00:03:27.080> or<00:03:27.170> whatever<00:03:27.670> for

been out in the vehicle or whatever for
a<00:03:28.730> while<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.090> got<00:03:29.270> cold<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.750> brought<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.020> in

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
a while and got cold you brought it in

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.960 
a while and got cold you brought it in
you're<00:03:30.290> trying<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.560> set<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.770> thing<00:03:30.890> up<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.220> it

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
you're trying to set the thing up and it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.270 
you're trying to set the thing up and it
can<00:03:32.150> be<00:03:32.180> brittle<00:03:32.540> from<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.780> cold<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.280> just

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
can be brittle from the cold and just

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.770 
can be brittle from the cold and just
from<00:03:34.370> regular<00:03:34.730> wear<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.270> tear<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.450> mean<00:03:35.630> this

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
from regular wear and tear I mean this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
from regular wear and tear I mean this
is<00:03:35.959> hard<00:03:36.200> plastic<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:36.950> you're<00:03:37.700> continually

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
is hard plastic and you're continually

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.030 
is hard plastic and you're continually
bending<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.780> tighten<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.170> up<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.860> pole

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
bending it to tighten it up on the pole

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.910 
bending it to tighten it up on the pole
and<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:41.450> bust<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.840> couple<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.200> these<00:03:42.290> things<00:03:42.590> and

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
and I bust a couple of these things and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.199 
and I bust a couple of these things and
it<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:43.190> sucks<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.670> bust<00:03:43.850> one<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
it really sucks and you bust one of the

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.620 
it really sucks and you bust one of the
gig<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:45.220> it's<00:03:46.220> just<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.610> terrible<00:03:46.910> crappy<00:03:47.360> way

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
gig and it's just a terrible crappy way

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.979 
gig and it's just a terrible crappy way
to<00:03:48.010> put<00:03:49.010> this<00:03:49.040> thing<00:03:49.340> together<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.840> it's

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
to put this thing together but it's

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.180 
to put this thing together but it's
pretty<00:03:51.080> much<00:03:51.230> what<00:03:51.290> we're<00:03:51.500> left<00:03:51.650> with<00:03:51.920> unless

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
pretty much what we're left with unless

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.070 
pretty much what we're left with unless
we<00:03:52.370> want<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.640> get<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.940> more<00:03:53.300> expensive<00:03:53.630> like<00:03:54.050> a

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
we want to get a more expensive like a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.870 
we want to get a more expensive like a
global<00:03:54.590> trust<00:03:54.860> for<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.100> triangle<00:03:55.520> truss<00:03:55.730> on
