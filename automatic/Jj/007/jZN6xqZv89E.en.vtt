this<00:00:34.040> alchemy<00:00:35.040> filters<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:35.940> chlorine

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
this alchemy filters out chlorine

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
this alchemy filters out chlorine
sediment<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> big<00:00:39.570> thing<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
sediment and but the big thing that it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.709 
sediment and but the big thing that it
does<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:41.420> alkalizing<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
does is it's actually alkalizing the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.350 
does is it's actually alkalizing the
water<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.350> taking<00:00:43.730> normal<00:00:44.730> water<00:00:44.969> which

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
water so it's taking normal water which

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
water so it's taking normal water which
is<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.690> seven<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> taking<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> about

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
is about seven and taking it up to about

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.840 
is about seven and taking it up to about
8.5<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> night<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> pH<00:00:49.559> scale<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
8.5 a night on a pH scale and what that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.029 
8.5 a night on a pH scale and what that
does<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.600> body<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.199> helps<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> balance

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
does for our body it helps to balance

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.970 
does for our body it helps to balance
our<00:00:53.460> pH<00:00:53.850> levels<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.809> helps<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> bring<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.800> out

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
our pH levels it helps to bring the out

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.470 
our pH levels it helps to bring the out
the<00:00:56.640> acidity<00:00:57.230> being<00:00:58.230> acidic<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.910> outline

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the acidity being acidic up to outline

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
the acidity being acidic up to outline
and<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> alkalies<00:01:01.649> their<00:01:01.800> body

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and when we can alkalies their body

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
and when we can alkalies their body
there's<00:01:02.280> an<00:01:02.430> amazing<00:01:02.789> amount<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.449> things<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
there's an amazing amount of things that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
there's an amazing amount of things that
can<00:01:03.899> happen<00:01:04.140> first<00:01:04.949> no<00:01:05.339> disease<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.970> live<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can happen first no disease can live in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
can happen first no disease can live in
an<00:01:06.330> alkaline<00:01:06.750> environment<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> thrives

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
an alkaline environment but it thrives

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
an alkaline environment but it thrives
in<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.369> acidic<00:01:08.670> environment<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.140> you're

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
in an acidic environment so when you're

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
in an acidic environment so when you're
drinking<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> Pops<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> juices<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
drinking the Pops and the juices you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
drinking the Pops and the juices you
know<00:01:12.510> they're<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.500> acidic<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
know they're actually acidic and I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
know they're actually acidic and I
they're<00:01:15.840> causing<00:01:16.320> our<00:01:16.590> body<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.460> acidic

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
they're causing our body to be acidic

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
they're causing our body to be acidic
and<00:01:18.119> therefore<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.590> become

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and therefore that's how we can become

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.200 
and therefore that's how we can become
sick<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:21.390> by<00:01:21.630> getting<00:01:21.930> our<00:01:22.200> body<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
sick is by getting our body to the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.679 
sick is by getting our body to the
acidosis<00:01:24.210> state<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.460> acid<00:01:26.460> state<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
acidosis state or acid state we want to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
acidosis state or acid state we want to
do<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:27.930> much<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> keep<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> all

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
do as much as we can to keep it all

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399 
do as much as we can to keep it all
going<00:01:29.400> through<00:01:29.820> our<00:01:29.970> foods<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.509> drinking

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
going through our foods and drinking

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.069 
going through our foods and drinking
water<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> especially<00:01:32.430> alkaline<00:01:33.119> water<00:01:33.360> now

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
water and especially alkaline water now

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.929 
water and especially alkaline water now
this<00:01:35.090> alchemy<00:01:36.530> comes<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.740> two<00:01:37.950> filters<00:01:38.280> okay

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
this alchemy comes with two filters okay

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.230 
this alchemy comes with two filters okay
so<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.540> six<00:01:40.110> months<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:41.520> each<00:01:41.880> filter

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so it's about six months on each filter

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.499 
so it's about six months on each filter
or<00:01:42.600> 500<00:01:43.229> liters<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.729> double<00:01:45.119> walled<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
or 500 liters and it's double walled so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
or 500 liters and it's double walled so
it's<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> keep<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.140> either<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.829> cold

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it's going to keep it either really cold

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.389 
it's going to keep it either really cold
or<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.820> hot<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.360> water<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.950> with<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.189> hot

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
or really hot your water I with the hot

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.520 
or really hot your water I with the hot
water<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> actually<00:01:51.390> pour<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.500> boiling

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
water you can actually pour in boiling

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.100 
water you can actually pour in boiling
hot<00:01:53.040> water<00:01:53.220> twist<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> lid<00:01:54.360> give<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.049> a

hot water twist on the lid give it a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.289 
hot water twist on the lid give it a
couple<00:01:55.140> shakes<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> let<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.310> sit<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.700> 15

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
couple shakes and let it sit for 15

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.929 
couple shakes and let it sit for 15
minutes<00:01:57.540> allowing<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> alkalize<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> then

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
minutes allowing it to alkalize and then

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.999 
minutes allowing it to alkalize and then
pour<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> make<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> tea<00:02:01.439> you're<00:02:01.860> going

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
pour it out and make a tea you're going
