00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
first experiment with colored hair dye
and<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.189> used<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> directions<00:00:33.510> temporary

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

and we used the directions temporary
hair<00:00:34.260> dye<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:35.040> meant<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> wash<00:00:35.520> out

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
hair dye so this was meant to wash out

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.459 
hair dye so this was meant to wash out
in<00:00:35.969> probably<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.420> five<00:00:36.750> washes<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
in probably about five washes and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.520 
in probably about five washes and
initially<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.489> wanted<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.210> lavender<00:00:40.110> well<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
initially we wanted a lavender well I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.690 
initially we wanted a lavender well I
wanted<00:00:40.950> eleven<00:00:41.340> Terry<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.510> want<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.350> head<00:00:43.700> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
your hair as light as possible so that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
your hair as light as possible so that
the<00:00:49.829> lighter<00:00:50.070> color<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.520> show<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the lighter color will show up and we

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
the lighter color will show up and we
could<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.899> quite<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.289> Alan's<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.739> as

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
could have quite get Alan's here as

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
could have quite get Alan's here as
light<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.030> we've<00:00:54.180> sort<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> gone<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
light so we've sort of gone for like a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
light so we've sort of gone for like a
muted<00:00:55.559> purple<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.610> looks<00:00:56.730> really

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
muted purple and I think it looks really

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
muted purple and I think it looks really
cool<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:57.930> total<00:00:58.230> noobs<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cool and we're total noobs with this

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
cool and we're total noobs with this
kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> hair<00:00:59.340> dye<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
kind of hair dye so this is from the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
kind of hair dye so this is from the
perspective<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:02.010> people<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:02.969> never

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
perspective of people that have never

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.740 
perspective of people that have never
done<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> before

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
done it before

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
done it before
so<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.159> updated<00:01:05.700> version

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
so if you want to see an updated version

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
so if you want to see an updated version
maybe<00:01:06.299> after<00:01:06.780> we've<00:01:06.900> done<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> couple<00:01:07.470> of

the<00:01:57.420> goal<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> hair

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829

the goal with this was to make the hair
as<00:01:58.950> light<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.399> possible<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.210> mine<00:02:00.750> didn't

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
as light as possible but mine didn't

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
as light as possible but mine didn't
really<00:02:01.229> work<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.439> well<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.460> went<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.729> here

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
really work that well so we went in here

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.030 
really work that well so we went in here
and<00:02:03.119> tried<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.600> put<00:02:03.840> together<00:02:04.020> 11<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> mix

like it in your hair so this is the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.050 
like it in your hair so this is the
color<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:25.770> ended<00:02:26.129> up<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.819> first

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
color we ended up with in the first

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
color we ended up with in the first
round<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.319> didn't<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:28.680> end<00:02:28.920> up

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
round but it didn't actually end up

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.470 
round but it didn't actually end up
working<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> end<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:29.910> kind<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.269> sad

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
working in the end which is kind of sad

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.290 
working in the end which is kind of sad
but<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:31.410> went<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.739> for<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.250> second<00:02:32.670> go<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.180> this

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
but we went in for a second go and this

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.839 
but we went in for a second go and this
is<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.599> color<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.050> ended<00:02:34.349> up<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.950> think<00:02:35.489> to

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
is the color we ended up with I think to

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.759 
is the color we ended up with I think to
get<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> true<00:02:36.300> violet<00:02:36.569> color<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.200> needed

get a true violet color I really needed

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.350 
get a true violet color I really needed
to<00:02:37.890> strip<00:02:38.250> down<00:02:38.400> my<00:02:38.580> hair<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> lot<00:02:38.970> more<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
to strip down my hair a lot more and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.780 
to strip down my hair a lot more and
make<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.660> lot<00:02:39.840> blonder<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.489> kind<00:02:41.670> of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
make the lot blonder but we just kind of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.339 
make the lot blonder but we just kind of
worked<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.300> color<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.019> want<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.670 
day for playing the color we we're too
fussy<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.000> section<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> hair<00:02:48.690> off<00:02:48.930> into

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
fussy we just section the hair off into

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710 
fussy we just section the hair off into
two<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.610> applied<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.030> again<00:02:51.420> with<00:02:51.569> our

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
two and then applied it again with our

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750 
two and then applied it again with our
fingers<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.319> only<00:02:52.470> temporary<00:02:52.739> wash<00:02:53.310> out<00:02:53.519> dye

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
fingers it's only temporary wash out dye
so<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.330> didn't<00:02:54.569> really<00:02:54.599> see<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> big<00:02:55.440> deal<00:02:55.620> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
so we didn't really see is a big deal to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.399 
so we didn't really see is a big deal to
get<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.160> brush<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.900> footage<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
get a brush and all that this footage is

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.839 
get a brush and all that this footage is
actually<00:02:58.530> from<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> first<00:02:59.220> time<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.580> did<00:02:59.730> it

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
actually from the first time we did it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.910 
actually from the first time we did it
with<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.120> lighter<00:03:00.420> mix<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.019> day<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.620> we<00:03:01.739> did

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
with the lighter mix a day but we did

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.649 
with the lighter mix a day but we did
the<00:03:02.040> same<00:03:02.250> thing<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.849> we<00:03:03.000> went<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
the same thing when we went in with the

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.020 
the same thing when we went in with the
dark<00:03:03.900> mix<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.739> weird<00:03:05.129> funky<00:03:05.459> massage

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
dark mix just this weird funky massage

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.420 
dark mix just this weird funky massage
technique<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.650> took<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.010> plastic

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
technique and then we took this plastic

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.220 
technique and then we took this plastic
bag<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.940> just<00:03:09.120> sort<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.360> threw<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.629> over<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
bag and just sort of threw that over the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.649 
bag and just sort of threw that over the
hair<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.220> dry<00:03:11.550> although<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.360> hindsight

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
hair for it to dry although in hindsight

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.330 
hair for it to dry although in hindsight
I<00:03:12.930> think<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.290> should<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.560> piled<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.099> top

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I think we should have piled it on top

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.500 
I think we should have piled it on top
of<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.519> head<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:15.000> probably<00:03:15.360> would<00:03:15.480> have

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
of the head and it probably would have

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.059 
of the head and it probably would have
done<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> better<00:03:16.019> job<00:03:16.140> at<00:03:16.470> soaking<00:03:16.830> up<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
done a better job at soaking up the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.940 
done a better job at soaking up the
color<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.640> two<00:03:18.150> hours<00:03:18.480> later<00:03:18.690> tada<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.800> this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
color and two hours later tada so this

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.589 
color and two hours later tada so this
is<00:03:20.099> what<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.370> looks<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> end<00:03:21.150> our

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
is what it looks like in the end our
