I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.170> idea<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.640> more

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I think the idea is that you get more

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
I think the idea is that you get more
production<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.869> highly

compensated players than your lower

compensated players than your lower
compensated<00:01:45.570> players<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.860> doesn't

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
compensated players but it doesn't

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.030 
compensated players but it doesn't
always<00:01:47.250> work<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.549> way<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.860> again<00:01:49.860> the
