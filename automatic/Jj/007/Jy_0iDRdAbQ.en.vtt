00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
beginning and you see this little

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.059 
beginning and you see this little
diamond<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.750> right<00:02:15.349> below<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.739> video

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.130 
diamond here on right below the video
that's<00:02:16.640> keyframe<00:02:17.209> that's<00:02:17.450> how<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.750> basic

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
that's keyframe that's how you do basic

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.949 
that's keyframe that's how you do basic
animation<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.610> click<00:02:20.240> on<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.630> then<00:02:20.870> you

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
animation so you click on it then you

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.710 
animation so you click on it then you
click<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.470> very<00:02:21.680> end<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> clip

click at the very end of the clip
click<00:02:23.720> keyframe<00:02:24.170> again<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.740> then<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.310> want

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
click keyframe again and then you want

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.330 
click keyframe again and then you want
to<00:02:25.550> drag<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.360> knife<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.590> very<00:02:27.920> end<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.250> the

to drag a knife to the very end of the
screen<00:02:28.670> make<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.450> about<00:02:29.660> parallel<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.320> what<00:02:30.470> it

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
screen make it about parallel to what it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.300 
screen make it about parallel to what it
was<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.390> that's<00:02:32.390> how<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.320> here

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
was and that's how you do it and here

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.090 
was and that's how you do it and here
you<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.760> rotate<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:36.100> counterclockwise

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
you want to rotate it counterclockwise

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.160 
you want to rotate it counterclockwise
at<00:02:38.000> least<00:02:38.150> that's<00:02:38.360> how<00:02:38.510> mine<00:02:38.720> was<00:02:38.900> thrown

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
at least that's how mine was thrown

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.570 
at least that's how mine was thrown
maybe<00:02:39.560> yours<00:02:39.800> will<00:02:39.950> sound<00:02:40.130> different<00:02:40.220> but

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
maybe yours will sound different but

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.640 
maybe yours will sound different but
this<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.790> counter<00:02:41.210> clockwise<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.350> want<00:02:42.560> to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
this is counter clockwise you want to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.610 
this is counter clockwise you want to
just<00:02:42.830> rotate<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.550> bunch<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.270> times<00:02:44.620> make

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
just rotate it a bunch of times make

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.530 
just rotate it a bunch of times make
sure<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.840> looks<00:02:48.050> good<00:02:48.320> just<00:02:49.030> keep<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.240> doing

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sure it looks good just keep on doing

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.590 
sure it looks good just keep on doing
this<00:02:50.660> until<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.110> find<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.250> good<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:56.420> make

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
this until you find it good and make

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720 
this until you find it good and make
sure<00:02:56.780> you're<00:02:57.070> spinning<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> right<00:02:58.550> way

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
sure you're spinning it the right way

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
sure you're spinning it the right way
because<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.300> might<00:02:59.450> accidentally<00:02:59.960> spin<00:03:00.320> it

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
because you might accidentally spin it

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.190 
because you might accidentally spin it
the<00:03:00.530> opposite<00:03:00.920> way<00:03:01.330> just<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.450> few<00:03:02.720> more<00:03:02.870> I'll<00:03:02.990> do

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
the opposite way just a few more I'll do

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.820 
the opposite way just a few more I'll do
here<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:06.100> seems<00:03:07.100> about<00:03:07.220> good<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:09.680> might

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
here that seems about good and you might

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.560 
here that seems about good and you might
want<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.010> downsize<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> little<00:03:11.120> bit<00:03:11.330> more

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
want to downsize this a little bit more

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.780 
want to downsize this a little bit more
that's<00:03:11.930> what<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.140> do<00:03:12.310> depending<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.430> how<00:03:13.610> close

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that's what I do depending on how close

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.430 
that's what I do depending on how close
that<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.120> want<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.510> camera<00:03:14.840> on<00:03:14.990> how<00:03:15.170> big

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
that you want to the camera on how big

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.960 
that you want to the camera on how big
it<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:17.090> like<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:18.370> also<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.640> seems<00:03:19.820> like

it is to so like that also it seems like

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.280 
it is to so like that also it seems like

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
I might have to color correct this to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.050 
I might have to color correct this to
make<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.470> seem<00:03:21.890> better<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.610> background

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060
