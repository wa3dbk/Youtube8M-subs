00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.810 

that<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.630> basic<00:00:51.020> principle<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:52.100> America<00:00:52.640> is

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
that the basic principle that America is

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
ethnicity and you know I think that the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.600 
ethnicity and you know I think that the
same<00:01:15.380> evolution<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:15.979> I've<00:01:16.100> gone<00:01:16.280> through<00:01:16.340> is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
same evolution that I've gone through is

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.460 
same evolution that I've gone through is
an<00:01:16.729> evolution<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.420> country<00:01:17.570> as<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.320> whole

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
an evolution that the country as a whole

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.260 
an evolution that the country as a whole
has<00:01:18.740> gone<00:01:18.950> through<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.820> think<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.180> a

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
has gone through and I think it is a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.460 
has gone through and I think it is a
profoundly<00:01:20.810> positive<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.610> when<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
profoundly positive so that when the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.719 
profoundly positive so that when the
supreme<00:01:27.740> court<00:01:28.009> essentially<00:01:28.280> called<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
supreme court essentially called the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.999 
supreme court essentially called the
question<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.270> taking<00:01:29.660> this<00:01:29.810> case<00:01:30.649> about

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
question by taking this case about

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.969 
question by taking this case about
California's<00:01:31.729> law<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.810> didn't<00:01:33.380> feel<00:01:33.500> like<00:01:33.530> that

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
California's law I didn't feel like that

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:34.960 
California's law I didn't feel like that
was<00:01:34.220> something<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.910> administration

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
was something that this administration

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.680 
was something that this administration
could<00:01:35.840> avoid<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:37.220> felt<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.090> was<00:01:38.180> important<00:01:38.630> for

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
could avoid I felt it was important for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.690 
could avoid I felt it was important for
us<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.960> articulate<00:01:40.600> well<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.869> believe<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.520> what

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
us to articulate well I believe and what

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.950 
us to articulate well I believe and what
this<00:01:43.850> administration<00:01:44.000> stands<00:01:44.750> for<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
this administration stands for and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.340 
this administration stands for and
although<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.200> do<00:01:48.259> think<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:49.869> we're<00:01:50.869> seeing<00:01:51.140> on

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
although I do think that we're seeing on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.400 
although I do think that we're seeing on
a<00:01:51.380> state-by-state<00:01:51.710> basis<00:01:53.170> progress<00:01:54.170> being

a state-by-state basis progress being

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
weigh in why not just argue that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.220
