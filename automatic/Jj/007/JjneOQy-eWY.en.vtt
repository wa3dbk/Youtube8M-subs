leaks<00:00:12.179> from<00:00:12.480> seed<00:00:13.070> now<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.790> left<00:00:15.000> here

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
leaks from seed now on the left here

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.230 
leaks from seed now on the left here
these<00:00:16.680> two<00:00:16.920> pots<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.430> leeks<00:00:17.640> are<00:00:17.880> planted

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
these two pots of leeks are planted

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.200 
these two pots of leeks are planted
about<00:00:18.330> three<00:00:18.840> weeks<00:00:19.050> ago<00:00:19.699> in<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> cold

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
about three weeks ago in the cold

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.590 
about three weeks ago in the cold
bedroom<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> propagator<00:00:23.060> no<00:00:24.060> no<00:00:24.390> real

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

bedroom not in a propagator no no real
heating<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.859> does<00:00:26.070> keep

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
heating in here but it just does keep

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.230 
heating in here but it just does keep
above<00:00:26.699> freezing<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> keeps<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:29.090> 50<00:00:30.090> or

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
above freezing so it keeps about 50 or

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.520 
above freezing so it keeps about 50 or
60<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:33.329> course<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.690> us<00:00:33.840> sleeping<00:00:34.260> here

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
60 and of course with us sleeping here

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.889 
60 and of course with us sleeping here
you<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.570> dampness<00:00:36.570> with

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you get a little bit of dampness with

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.810 
you get a little bit of dampness with
the<00:00:37.079> air<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.160> they've<00:00:38.340> done<00:00:38.520> rather<00:00:38.670> well

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the air and they've done rather well

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.680 
the air and they've done rather well
they<00:00:39.570> start<00:00:39.870> off<00:00:40.079> coming<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:41.100> chaotic<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
they start off coming up or chaotic and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
they start off coming up or chaotic and
then<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:43.800> seem<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> straighten

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
then they then they seem to straighten

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
then they then they seem to straighten
up<00:00:44.730> after<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> while<00:00:47.059> I've<00:00:48.059> put<00:00:48.480> them<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
up after a while I've put them in you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
up after a while I've put them in you
know<00:00:49.530> proper<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:51.090> seed<00:00:51.360> compost<00:00:52.789> sterilized

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
know proper the seed compost sterilized

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.600 
know proper the seed compost sterilized
compost<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.710> course<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> advantage<00:00:56.129> with

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
compost and of course the advantage with

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.740 
compost and of course the advantage with
that<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.600> weed

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
that is you don't get a lot of weed

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.599 
that is you don't get a lot of weed
seeds<00:00:58.079> coming<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.460> just

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
seeds coming up you know it's just

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
seeds coming up you know it's just
leaked<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.120> come<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.480> no<00:01:00.660> weeds<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> don't

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
leaked so come up no weeds so you don't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
leaked so come up no weeds so you don't
have<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.920> any<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.280> weeding<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> pot

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
have to do any little weeding in the pot

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
have to do any little weeding in the pot
or<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.840> smothered<00:01:04.290> by<00:01:04.439> weed

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
or they don't get smothered by weed

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.160 
or they don't get smothered by weed
seeds<00:01:07.280> now<00:01:08.280> those<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.000> pots<00:01:09.390> I've

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
seeds now those are the two pots I've

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.850 
seeds now those are the two pots I've
planted<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> week<00:01:11.820> ago<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:13.560> over<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
planted about a week ago for just over a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
planted about a week ago for just over a
week<00:01:13.890> probably<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.970> they're<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.600> just

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
week probably and they're just just

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.990 
week probably and they're just just
germinating<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:19.640> it's<00:01:20.640> quite<00:01:20.790> nice<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
germinating now and it's quite nice to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.109 
germinating now and it's quite nice to
have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> succession<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.869> leeks<00:01:22.460> because<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
have a succession of leeks because you

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.370 
have a succession of leeks because you
don't<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.420> quite<00:01:24.600> what's<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> happen

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
don't know quite what's going to happen

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.910 
don't know quite what's going to happen
in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> season<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:28.170> we've<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.500> plants

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
in the season and also we've got plants

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
in the season and also we've got plants
and<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> village<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.180> were<00:01:30.299> after

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and in the village and they were after

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.100 
and in the village and they were after
plant<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.670> they<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:33.750> might<00:01:33.930> eat

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
plant so they need they might eat

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.460 
plant so they need they might eat
something<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> thought<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.659> leeks<00:01:37.110> were

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
something now I thought that leeks were

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
something now I thought that leeks were
a<00:01:37.970> problem-free<00:01:39.170> drop<00:01:40.400> that<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:41.670> passed<00:01:42.030> two

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
a problem-free drop that they passed two

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.710 
a problem-free drop that they passed two
years<00:01:42.829> we've<00:01:43.829> had<00:01:43.890> problems<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.790> leek<00:01:45.420> moth

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
years we've had problems with leek moth

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
years we've had problems with leek moth
which<00:01:46.530> has<00:01:46.770> covered<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> whole<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
which has covered the whole of the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.920 
which has covered the whole of the
southwest<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.840> England<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.820> leek<00:01:50.820> moth<00:01:51.119> has

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
southwest of England and leek moth has

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.389 
southwest of England and leek moth has
two<00:01:52.729> sets<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> two<00:01:54.450> seasons<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.649> breeds<00:01:55.979> twice

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
two sets of two seasons it breeds twice

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.109 
two sets of two seasons it breeds twice
in<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> year<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
in a year and

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.380 
in a year and
it<00:01:59.450> lays<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.899> takes<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.670> or<00:02:01.670> somewhere

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
it lays it takes in the or somewhere

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.660 
it lays it takes in the or somewhere
around<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.810> leak<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.950> little<00:02:04.490> grub

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
around the leak and the little grub

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.120 
around the leak and the little grub
burrows<00:02:05.149> right<00:02:05.270> into<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.689> leaking<00:02:06.130> finishes

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
burrows right into the leaking finishes

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.180 
burrows right into the leaking finishes
