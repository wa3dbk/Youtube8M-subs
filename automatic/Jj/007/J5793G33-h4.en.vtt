00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 it was in 1981 when for the first time the hearts of thousands of Panamanians 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.900
 they beat with joy when they reached the goal proposed by the telethon 20 30 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:16.019
 from that moment these same hearts keep beating with more energy 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.019
 to make dreams come true for thousands of Panamanians 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 more and more achievements of great social impact 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.230
 left as a result 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.519
 of the more than 27 years of the telethon 20 30 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.050
 all thanks to the support and effort of each of the members of this 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.220
 small country 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.020
 step by step, the development and the fruits of the work have been monitored and 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 effort printed in each of the works and when we look at our 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.060
 around it becomes clear that there are vulnerable groups of people 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.910
 who have received the seeds of hope 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.780
 through all your supports 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.420
 we have turned dreams into reality 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.550
 provided diagnostic evaluations and treatments to thousands of children 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.190
 heroes 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.140
 that even the smallest effort 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.820
 It translates into success when done with the soul delivered 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.730
 and a dream ahead 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.850
 we have echoed the requests of those who see the world go through 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.660
 in front of 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.980
 and capture even the smallest detail like a sigh 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.220
 and the desire to realize all the goals 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.380
 since they are reflected and rest 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.900
 that you only need to have one goal 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.310
 to be able to reach it is that tour 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.370
 that smile of a child thanking for how little or much he receives 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.830
 from a village that they never forget 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.790
 of the needs of his brothers what motivates them to work there 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 next to organizations it 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.730
 charities 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.770
 to feel responsible 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.660
 meet our objectives 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.930
 to bring hope 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.400
 the new ones 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 those little little hearts 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.320
 your receipts bookmark 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.899
 was given the opportunity I want to make thousands of innocent little angels 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.130
 they appreciate this opportunity only with a yawn 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.099
 With leaps and bounds progress has been made in the development opportunity of 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.649
 small ones that show 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.409
 who beyond any physical disability there is a lesson in 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.749
 love overcoming and success 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.799
 that could be carried out with the simple integration 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.930
 and the intention to keep the points in an ideal 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.169
 each new facility that has been built is more than a building 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:42.939
 is actually the most perfect brand of solidarity and the latent desire of 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:43.949
 overcoming 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.529
 and live every day with a new news 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.939
 and a new incomparable moment that treasures 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.289
 in our minds 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.539
 now there are many children and parents who receive with great satisfaction 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.239
 the care and services that save their lives 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.569
 iker to new perspectives to those little sweets 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.569
 to go with the desire to see a 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.449
 we have made a reality 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.849
 and every day they reach more people who need them 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.339
 there are many more that are still to come 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.979
 with this main reason 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.709
 to continue 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.549
 bull to look
