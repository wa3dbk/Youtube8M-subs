three<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.270> instructions<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:21.200> need<00:02:21.230> to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
three of the instructions we need to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.630 
three of the instructions we need to
make<00:02:21.560> sure<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.860> we<00:02:21.980> have<00:02:22.190> 30<00:02:23.470> 1102<00:02:24.470> verses<00:02:24.920> we

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
make sure that we have 30 1102 verses we

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.580 
make sure that we have 30 1102 verses we
don't<00:02:25.819> want<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.239> single<00:02:26.810> verse<00:02:26.959> more<00:02:27.260> than<00:02:27.440> that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
don't want a single verse more than that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.320 
don't want a single verse more than that
or<00:02:27.800> or<00:02:28.459> less<00:02:28.700> first<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.750> all<00:02:29.840> obviously

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
or or less first of all obviously

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.120 
or or less first of all obviously
revelations<00:02:32.330> 21<00:02:32.810> got<00:02:33.140> copied<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.860> bunch<00:02:34.040> of

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
revelations 21 got copied a bunch of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.900 
revelations 21 got copied a bunch of
times<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:35.569> know<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:35.810> only<00:02:35.959> need<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.260> once<00:02:36.910> so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
times you know we only need it once so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.199 
times you know we only need it once so
I'm<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.239> go<00:02:38.330> ahead<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.980> delete<00:02:39.980> all<00:02:40.430> my

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
I'm going to go ahead and delete all my

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.009 
I'm going to go ahead and delete all my
extra<00:02:42.160> lines<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.880> see<00:02:44.300> where<00:02:45.459> okay

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
extra lines of that and see where okay

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.870 
extra lines of that and see where okay
give<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.080> those

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
give it those

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.880 
give it those
these<00:02:51.470> okay<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.770> we<00:02:55.770> have

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
these okay now you can see that we have

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.070 
these okay now you can see that we have
space<00:02:56.670> between<00:02:56.700> each<00:02:57.060> line<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.780> don't<00:02:57.930> want

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
space between each line we don't want

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.520 
space between each line we don't want
that<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.610> if<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.790> reading<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> directions<00:03:00.530> we

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that so if you reading the directions we

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.850 
that so if you reading the directions we
want<00:03:01.710> to<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:03.120> rid<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.630> double<00:03:04.530> returns

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
want to get rid of the double returns

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.540 
want to get rid of the double returns
and<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:07.080> click<00:03:07.590> control<00:03:08.040> H<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
and to do that you click control H and

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.850 
and to do that you click control H and
notepad<00:03:09.150> plus<00:03:09.420> plus<00:03:09.450> or<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.230> can<00:03:10.380> go<00:03:10.470> up<00:03:10.500> here

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
notepad plus plus or you can go up here

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.540 
notepad plus plus or you can go up here
to<00:03:10.890> search<00:03:11.540> replace<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.160> want<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.310> copy

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
to search replace and you want to copy

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.980 
to search replace and you want to copy
and<00:03:14.850> paste<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.600> code<00:03:16.460> into<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.730> copy<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
and paste this code into the copy and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.490 
and paste this code into the copy and
replace<00:03:19.050> dialogue<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.870> want<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.200> run

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
replace dialogue and you want to run

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
replace dialogue and you want to run
this<00:03:22.680> code<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:26.730> will<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:27.120> rid<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.420> all

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
this code and it will get rid of all

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.780 
this code and it will get rid of all
these<00:03:27.960> extra<00:03:28.500> lines<00:03:28.680> make<00:03:29.100> sure<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.400> regular

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
these extra lines make sure that regular

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.290 
these extra lines make sure that regular
expression<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.300> checked<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.940> will<00:03:33.120> take<00:03:33.270> a

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
expression is checked this will take a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.130 
expression is checked this will take a
second

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.580 

so<00:03:38.800> I'll<00:03:39.550> go<00:03:39.730> down<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.360> end<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.020> once

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
so I'll go down to the end and once

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.250 
so I'll go down to the end and once
again<00:03:41.710> I<00:03:42.070> have<00:03:42.370> an<00:03:42.490> extra<00:03:42.820> line<00:03:43.390> there<00:03:44.110> should

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
again I have an extra line there should

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.610 
again I have an extra line there should
be<00:03:44.410> 30<00:03:45.570> 1102<00:03:46.570> lines<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.110> have<00:03:47.230> an<00:03:47.320> extra<00:03:47.590> one

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
be 30 1102 lines and I have an extra one

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.880 
be 30 1102 lines and I have an extra one
in<00:03:47.830> there<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.240> basically<00:03:49.240> a<00:03:49.810> verse<00:03:50.560> has<00:03:50.740> been

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
in there and basically a verse has been

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.790 
in there and basically a verse has been
duplicated<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.540> notepad<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.320> extremely

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
duplicated and notepad it's extremely

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.230 
duplicated and notepad it's extremely
easy<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.100> fix<00:03:54.370> them<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.820> get<00:03:54.970> rid<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.120> that

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
easy to fix them to get rid of that

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.020 
easy to fix them to get rid of that
extra<00:03:55.540> verse<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.800> got<00:03:56.950> copied<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:57.760> go

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
extra verse that got copied you just go

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.450 
extra verse that got copied you just go
into<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.660> circuit<00:03:59.230> replace<00:03:59.500> dialogue<00:03:59.980> and

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
into the circuit replace dialogue and

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.530 
into the circuit replace dialogue and
you<00:04:00.850> copy<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.330> code<00:04:06.180> there<00:04:07.180> we<00:04:07.240> go

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
you copy this code there we go

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.960 
you copy this code there we go
that's<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.930> one<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.200> was<00:04:08.730> duplicated<00:04:09.730> and

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
that's the one that was duplicated and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.600 
that's the one that was duplicated and
now<00:04:10.120> we<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.540> correct<00:04:10.720> amount<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.080> verses

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
now we have the correct amount of verses

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.220 
now we have the correct amount of verses
and<00:04:12.610> by<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.880> way<00:04:13.000> if<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.270> have<00:04:13.480> way<00:04:13.750> less<00:04:13.780> than

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
and by the way if you have way less than

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.120 
and by the way if you have way less than
30<00:04:15.030> 1102<00:04:16.030> lines<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.930> means<00:04:17.109> your<00:04:17.470> computer

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
30 1102 lines that means your computer

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.940 
30 1102 lines that means your computer
isn't<00:04:18.250> fast<00:04:18.910> enough<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.540> need<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.950> start

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
isn't fast enough and you need to start

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.950 
isn't fast enough and you need to start
over<00:04:21.100> again<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.790> need<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.060> go<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.630> script

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
over again you need to go to the script

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.050 
over again you need to go to the script
and<00:04:23.169> slow<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.860> down<00:04:23.890> and<00:04:24.760> there's

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
and slow it down and there's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.550 
and slow it down and there's
instructions<00:04:26.100> back<00:04:27.100> here<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:27.790> how<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.060> do<00:04:28.210> that

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
instructions back here on how to do that

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.500 
instructions back here on how to do that
all<00:04:29.560> right<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.740> we<00:04:30.730> need<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.970> do<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> couple<00:04:31.270> more

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
all right so we need to do a couple more

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.480 
all right so we need to do a couple more
things<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.960> get<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.410> work<00:04:32.500> first<00:04:33.250> thing

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
things to get this to work first thing

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.620 
things to get this to work first thing
is<00:04:33.640> we<00:04:33.790> need<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.060> remove<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.480> verse

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
is we need to remove the verse

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.620 
is we need to remove the verse
references<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.440> these<00:04:36.070> things<00:04:36.280> over<00:04:36.400> here

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
references that these things over here

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.360 
references that these things over here
so<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.720> use<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.200> code<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.650> do<00:04:38.770> that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
so you use this code to do that

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.750 
so you use this code to do that
make<00:04:40.970> sure<00:04:41.090> you<00:04:41.150> get<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.330> space<00:04:42.639> we're<00:04:43.639> going

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
make sure you get the space we're going

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.340 
make sure you get the space we're going
to<00:04:43.820> replace<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.210> with<00:04:44.240> nothing

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.320 

regular<00:04:49.190> expressions<00:04:49.220> still<00:04:49.970> check<00:04:50.150> that's

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
regular expressions still check that's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.420 
regular expressions still check that's
good<00:04:50.620> now<00:04:51.620> we're<00:04:51.740> going<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.890> turn<00:04:52.010> regular

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
good now we're going to turn regular

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.320 
good now we're going to turn regular
expression<00:04:52.850> off<00:04:53.350> okay<00:04:54.880> because<00:04:55.880> these<00:04:56.150> are

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
just some characters we're going to

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.430 
just some characters we're going to
replace<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:59.780> going<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.050> delete<00:05:00.140> that<00:05:00.290> one

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
replace just going to delete that one

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.630 
replace just going to delete that one
replace<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.340> with<00:05:01.430> nothing<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:04.340> gotta<00:05:04.490> get

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
replace it with nothing you gotta get

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.890 
replace it with nothing you gotta get

we're<00:05:10.560> going<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.950> replace<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.240> left<00:05:12.420> bracket

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:25.810 

with<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:17.120> code

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.450 

and<00:05:26.090> we're<00:05:26.690> going<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.840> replace<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.500> right

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
and we're going to replace the right

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:39.879 
and we're going to replace the right
bracket<00:05:29.620> with<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:32.300> code

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:48.170 

okay<00:05:41.259> that's<00:05:42.259> it<00:05:43.389> so<00:05:44.389> I'm<00:05:44.750> going<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.050> save<00:05:45.560> this

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
and then we're going to change the name

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.920 
and then we're going to change the name
