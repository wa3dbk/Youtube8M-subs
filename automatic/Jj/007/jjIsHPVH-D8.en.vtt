 invited 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.020
 and the music in my texts impress if that with the

 Of course, a test if I can close, I've been doing it since 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.089
 Weeks at it will also look healthy 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.159
 with announcement 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.940
 and so that the mother does not believe she must bring him the necklace 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 Dried food balls give the designer a hunger in the world 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.230
 Want to fight the world 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.700
 Separate Oer Alea 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.270
 that was pure chicane from the creator again 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.310
 and then junior staff sharp-edged damage and a next 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.820
 June 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.460
 the 1 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.420
 and very important was not enough 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.430
 still so clumsy with Clive 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.380
 Jahan when baking must be incredibly accurate and analyze well 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.490
 How famous people organize themselves can be seen here in the earthquake 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.490
 Excerpts from the interviews and articles collected in which mainly creative 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.850
 reveal how to kick her Jenny in the butt and interesting article 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.080
 By the way, you can find both this "not his thing" theory 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.150
 a two-sided linked to the article at the already in May 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.120
 the most commonly used service Instapaper from Udine worth reading 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.940
 percentages only fresh from Dinu are all nicer 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.870
 Unfortunately I can not do it because I can do it the best 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.590
 but maybe more will succeed after all the probable inconspicuousness 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.540
 allows 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.159
 by no means trivializing drugs 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.109
 and therefore happy to trot to Frenkert Kompa way one contributes the very 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.439
 informative background on different drugs Orton mediates 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.750
 partly with typical British black humor, as in the case of Hunt Pablo 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.069
 the involuntary cocaine courier but good it does not need any drugs 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.829

 live ticker 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.059
 it will certainly be sung as well 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.439
 which get - besides text from there to the Greens 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.180
 For example, with Arthur Lee, an open source program grows automatically 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.359
 Lyrics and album cover to the songs you are currently playing so remains 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.950

 on the new original website Tracy Chapman 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.650
 which the visitors can disassemble according to their own ideas 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.859
 and also very colorful in the music video is the very beautiful and 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.599
 relaxed thing good in the purchase of cell phones to who wonders who 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 actually you do not want to call him when he's not home 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.340
 croissant 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.490
 nonsense 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.200
 Sternfeld Hearts everyone can 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.349
 that does not always have to be everything you do 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.329
 SID Valeri Hegarty just copied the famous artworks and then they 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.049
 apparently exposed to the most diverse forces of nature 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.639
 the insurance is too expensive 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.719
 and here is also just a masterpiece copied in which a computer 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.569
 generates random colors and just keeps the original image 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.099
 looking similar 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.099
 eternity is unfortunately not usable now 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.549
 maybe I would have somebody FranÃ§oise handicraft bit 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.659
 Skill the process 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.999
 Single perpetrator in Sweden can observe and so ever that yesterday 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.620
 and at the opening hopefully the boys of 1 million will play one 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.609
 Bank whose instruments have all been made of ice and that will be 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.629
 not only good but also looks really good what you get from one 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.369
 Unfortunately kitten can not say 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.469
 that's not a dime I miss 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.040
