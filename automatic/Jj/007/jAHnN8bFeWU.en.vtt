00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 how strong are the members scrubby 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 We are really advising you now 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.049
 really arrived in her limit 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.210
 or do you still have some tricks up 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.740
 stock all this and more now in one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.250
 further consequence of theories and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.250
 weight 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 hello dear friends i am almost and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.039
 welcome to another 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.289
 follow the theories and rumors 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.630
 ostermann peace world today it's about 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.040
 the topic the strength of the stroth pirates 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 my, how strong are you really 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.130
 and you still have some tricks up 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.120
 camp is not ours now 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.620
 limit arrived 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.239
 I'm referring to each one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.219
 member alone that means for 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 consider each member alone and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.700
 Just go to each member 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 strub advised to give my opinion 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.780
 If I believe that he really already 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.360
 arrived at the limit or if he still 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.739
 will have some tricks in stock and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 I 'll just go with that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 captain of the stroth pirates man was 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.949
 rafi now know that he is the gear4 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 has activated against the flamingo where you 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.850
 at least shown in manga and also the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.199
 anime fans will probably be something 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.820
 have learned about it 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.159
 It's definitely like that in this one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.210
 mode really very very strong like that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 strong as never before 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.510
 and he really does seem flamingo 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 to finish 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 you could almost say so 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 And now it's natural for you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 asking yourself as a band of peace is like asking 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.520
 because in a mode even stronger than 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.200
 momentary g4 and I think so 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.689
 Personally, this will happen every time 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 mode give at least one mode because 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.110
 when we think about it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 strong the flamingo is he is one of the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.579
 stronger samurai several but there are 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.110
 yes still the much emperor and it 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.329
 There are still the five wise men 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.820
 I believe I am the five wise ones 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.979
 and the four emperors are the strongest 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 all over the world are and so what needs 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.390
 is really also against the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.439
 and has to defeat some of them 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.090
 accordingly, must again now 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.880
 really be even stronger than in the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.430
 four modes and I had already 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.899
 in the g4 analysis really already about it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.750
 talked about it personally 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.090
 believe things g5 will be easy 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.490
 for the reason that we stop in German 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.979
 that means I would just do it 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.560
 own and we know so the cars 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.460
 from today have just about five to 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 six gears accordingly understood 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.770
 still 1 5 have gone my opinion 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.540
 according to and accordingly it is 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.800
 that I personally assume so 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.570
 that again really 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.270
 he has another mode while still 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.440
 stronger is a beer is four mode 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.420
 Of course, that's what it should be 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.980
 will also have another mode 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.080
 I personally believe in it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.120
 a mode was not his devil 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.530
 will use fruit and so it will 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.940
 in my opinion such a final 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.790
 fight against blackbeard 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.650
 there he probably has the power 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.640
 withdraw or awaken the forces 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.920
 paralyze every case 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.480
 accordingly, the need now 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.260
 really alone against blackbeard 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.110
 claim 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.410
 only with the help of his power and with 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.700
 help his muscular strength 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.920
 I personally believe in it because of me 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.080
 personally just not the fan of 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.540
 Devil's fruits am or I believe that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.580
 it would be unfair to me if rafi with 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.590
 a devil fruit just once 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.660
 had characters advantage over 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.730
 have no success and accordingly 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.860
 i really believe or hope for that 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.840
 that we have a mode now 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.180
 where he will really be without 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.690
 any without any use of his 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.620
 evil forces will fight like that and that 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.690
 means again very briefly 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.550
 summarized yes I believe that 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.260
 we are much stronger 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.060
 or he will definitely be much more 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.070
 get stronger that's for sure 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.410
 now it is natural for him now 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.600
 already damn strong appears on 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.380
 every case of the flamingo is ready now 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.330
 close 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.370
 Accordingly, it is just me 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.950
 Personally, assume that we 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.170
 really, at least one more 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.660
 other mode will at least stop 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.640
 still the 4 5 it is so he then 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.730
 after the encounter with ekici he had 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.790
 animal 2 and 3 learn that means yes 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.440
 Two modes at once and now it is like this 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.620
 that he of course in the two years 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.160
 stop the gear4 and the g5 has learned 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.110
 can 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.910
 and I personally hope for that and 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.320
 of course, be of your opinion 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.090
 curious what do you think about it 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.430
