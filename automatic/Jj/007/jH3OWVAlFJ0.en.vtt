dress so what I'm using now is a piece
of<00:00:14.900> Swedish<00:00:15.900> tracing<00:00:16.379> paper<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
of Swedish tracing paper which is what I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.370 
of Swedish tracing paper which is what I
really<00:00:18.360> like<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.599> use<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.869> pattern<00:00:19.200> making

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
really like to use this pattern making

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.679 
really like to use this pattern making
paper<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.340> soft<00:00:20.759> supple<00:00:21.300> paper

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
paper it's this really soft supple paper

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.900 
paper it's this really soft supple paper
and<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.529> can<00:00:22.649> actually<00:00:22.980> sew<00:00:23.250> through<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.669> so

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and you can actually sew through it so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.819 
and you can actually sew through it so
I'm<00:00:24.119> actually<00:00:24.270> going<00:00:24.509> to<00:00:24.570> sew<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.290> this<00:00:25.649> to

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
I'm actually going to sew on this to

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.950 
I'm actually going to sew on this to
show<00:00:26.040> you<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.579> sample<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.239> having<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> circle

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
show you a sample of having a circle

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.139 
show you a sample of having a circle
skirt<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.919> I've<00:00:29.040> cut<00:00:29.219> this<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.550> along<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
skirt and so I've cut this out along the

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.030 
skirt and so I've cut this out along the
curve<00:00:30.360> of<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.779> pattern<00:00:31.169> piece<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
curve of my pattern piece so this is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.830 
curve of my pattern piece so this is
Zack<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> exact<00:00:32.969> curve<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.390> would<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.690> been

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
Zack the exact curve I would have been

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
Zack the exact curve I would have been
hemming<00:00:34.079> anyway<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> did<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> went

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
hemming anyway and what I did was I went

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
hemming anyway and what I did was I went
ahead<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.740> pinned<00:00:37.740> it<00:00:37.920> sort<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.310> around<00:00:38.520> there

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
ahead and pinned it sort of around there

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.460 
ahead and pinned it sort of around there
pretending<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.720> is<00:00:39.810> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.990> be<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.320> name

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
pretending this is going to be my name

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.440 
pretending this is going to be my name

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
right on the pin right there see where

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
right on the pin right there see where
the<00:01:19.590> pin<00:01:19.740> went<00:01:19.979> through<00:01:20.219> I<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:21.359> marked<00:01:21.659> right

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the pin went through I just marked right

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.910 
the pin went through I just marked right
on<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:22.399> um<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.829> keep

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
on there um so I'm just going to keep

on there um so I'm just going to keep
going<00:01:26.130> around<00:01:26.280> marking<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.060> pins<00:01:27.709> hopefully

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
going around marking my pins hopefully

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:29.989 
going around marking my pins hopefully
you<00:01:28.770> guys<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.159> able<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.639> this<00:01:29.789> I<00:01:29.939> know

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
you guys will be able to see this I know

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.609 
you guys will be able to see this I know
we<00:01:30.179> talked<00:01:30.359> about<00:01:30.479> me<00:01:30.659> doing<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:31.049> close-ups

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
we talked about me doing more close-ups

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.999 
we talked about me doing more close-ups
but<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:33.149> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
but I have a really kind of not so

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.919 
but I have a really kind of not so
sophisticated<00:01:35.249> film<00:01:36.119> setup<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.749> doing

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
sophisticated film setup and I'm doing

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.789 
sophisticated film setup and I'm doing
this<00:01:37.109> alone<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:39.439> hopefully<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.740> work

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
this alone so hopefully this will work

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
and this is what it would look like

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.680 
and this is what it would look like
obviously<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.310> can<00:05:57.430> see<00:05:57.460> that<00:05:57.670> you<00:05:58.270> can<00:05:58.450> see

obviously you can see that you can see
the<00:05:58.840> two<00:05:59.020> rows<00:05:59.050> of<00:05:59.380> stitching<00:05:59.710> here<00:05:59.830> because

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
the two rows of stitching here because

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.980 
the two rows of stitching here because
this<00:06:00.310> is<00:06:00.490> transparent<00:06:01.180> pattern<00:06:01.540> making<00:06:01.690> paper

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
this is transparent pattern making paper

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.840 
this is transparent pattern making paper
but<00:06:02.290> with<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.860> fabric<00:06:03.190> you<00:06:03.310> won't<00:06:03.490> be<00:06:03.610> able<00:06:03.730> to

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
but with the fabric you won't be able to

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.460 
but with the fabric you won't be able to
see<00:06:03.970> that<00:06:04.060> other<00:06:04.210> row<00:06:04.450> and<00:06:04.720> obviously<00:06:05.380> you

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
see that other row and obviously you

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.660 
see that other row and obviously you
won't<00:06:05.590> be<00:06:05.710> using<00:06:05.890> red<00:06:06.100> marker<00:06:06.370> so<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.520> won't

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
won't be using red marker so you won't

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.890 
won't be using red marker so you won't
be<00:06:06.730> able<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:06.940> that<00:06:07.060> either<00:06:07.180> you've<00:06:07.480> got<00:06:07.690> it<00:06:07.780> a

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
be able to that either you've got it a

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.490 
be able to that either you've got it a
real<00:06:08.110> nice<00:06:08.410> narrow<00:06:08.740> hem<00:06:08.980> there<00:06:09.280> that<00:06:09.850> will

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
real nice narrow hem there that will

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.620 
real nice narrow hem there that will
that<00:06:11.500> will<00:06:11.560> take<00:06:11.890> the<00:06:12.070> fullness<00:06:12.310> nicely<00:06:12.970> so

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
that will take the fullness nicely so

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.880 
that will take the fullness nicely so
I'm<00:06:13.930> going<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.170> go<00:06:14.230> back<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:14.470> my<00:06:14.560> dress<00:06:14.740> and
