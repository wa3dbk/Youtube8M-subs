00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
they're suspended so I'm going to run

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.230 
they're suspended so I'm going to run
that<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.380> leader<00:01:43.649> tag<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.729> goes<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that on my leader tag this goes to a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
that on my leader tag this goes to a
barrel<00:01:45.570> swivel<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> sliding<00:01:47.040> egg<00:01:47.340> sinker

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
barrel swivel and a sliding egg sinker

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
barrel swivel and a sliding egg sinker
use<00:01:48.149> anywhere<00:01:48.540> between<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.960> quarter<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
use anywhere between a quarter and a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.649 
use anywhere between a quarter and a
half<00:01:49.649> ounce<00:01:49.890> sliding<00:01:50.369> egg<00:01:50.490> sinker<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.119> put<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
half ounce sliding egg sinker I put a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
half ounce sliding egg sinker I put a
bead<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.979> line<00:01:53.280> slides

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
bead on there so when that line slides

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
bead on there so when that line slides
through<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.750> weight<00:01:54.960> slides<00:01:55.290> down<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> main

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
through that weight slides down the main

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.459 
through that weight slides down the main
line<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.759> doesn't<00:01:57.090> beat<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> knot<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
line it doesn't beat up the knot on the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
line it doesn't beat up the knot on the
swivel<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.270> goes<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
swivel and so that just goes on up to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
swivel and so that just goes on up to
the<00:02:00.960> main<00:02:01.140> line<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.520> way<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.850> works

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the main line and the way this works

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
the main line and the way this works
they<00:02:03.360> cast<00:02:03.630> us<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.049> leaving<00:02:04.409> my<00:02:04.649> bail<00:02:04.920> open<00:02:05.280> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
they cast us out leaving my bail open on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.100 
they cast us out leaving my bail open on
my<00:02:05.490> rod

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
my rod

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.350 
my rod
the<00:02:06.200> line<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.650> pull<00:02:06.860> off<00:02:07.010> of<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.280> reel<00:02:07.490> let<00:02:08.240> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
the line to pull off of the reel let the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.790 
the line to pull off of the reel let the
egg<00:02:08.509> sinker<00:02:08.899> still<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.229> sink<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.740> bottom

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
egg sinker still it sink to the bottom

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.850 
egg sinker still it sink to the bottom
