00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
go and we put it through terrible

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.109 
go and we put it through terrible
terrible<00:00:50.129> punishment<00:00:50.699> i<00:00:50.729> mean<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.939> take<00:00:51.089> a

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:51.119 
terrible punishment i mean we take a

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.850 
terrible punishment i mean we take a
production<00:00:51.659> car<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.019> make<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.379> things<00:00:52.650> at

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:02.759 
needy part on the car so here at X Games

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:04.070 
needy part on the car so here at X Games
we<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.449> corners<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.900> are<00:01:03.960> very

narrow you can't make any mistakes you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.520 
narrow you can't make any mistakes you
slide<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.180> why'd<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> hit<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> wall<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.409> got

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
slide out why'd you hit the wall you got

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
slide out why'd you hit the wall you got
to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.680> able<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.890> turn<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:08.880> sharply<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to be able to turn in really sharply and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
to be able to turn in really sharply and
the<00:01:09.479> cars<00:01:09.659> got<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.930> super<00:01:10.229> responsive<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the cars got to be super responsive and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.260 
the cars got to be super responsive and
that's<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.340> advantage<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> Mitsubishi

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that's an advantage of the Mitsubishi

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
that's an advantage of the Mitsubishi
has<00:01:12.479> I've<00:01:12.780> driven<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> other<00:01:13.200> car<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.680> raced

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
has I've driven the other car as I raced

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
has I've driven the other car as I raced
the<00:01:14.040> other<00:01:14.159> cars<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.939> Drive<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the other cars and I Drive the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.660 
the other cars and I Drive the
Mitsubishi<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> its<00:01:16.170> sharp<00:01:16.380> handling

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
Mitsubishi because of its sharp handling

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.920 
Mitsubishi because of its sharp handling
the<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.820> thing<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> x-games<00:01:18.750> we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the good thing is that the x-games we

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
the good thing is that the x-games we
have<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.200> only<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> tarmac<00:01:19.740> section<00:01:20.340> but

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
have not only this tarmac section but

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.950 
have not only this tarmac section but
we've<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.790> huge<00:01:21.090> jump<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> stadium

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
we've got this huge jump in the stadium

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
we've got this huge jump in the stadium
like<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.230> 70-foot<00:01:22.890> gap<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.730> a<00:01:23.850> real

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like a 70-foot gap and it's a real

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.580 
like a 70-foot gap and it's a real
challenge<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:25.230> hard<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> know

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
challenge because it's hard to know

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
challenge because it's hard to know
exactly<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:26.100> speed<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.520> off<00:01:26.730> at<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
exactly what speed to go off at and you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.460 
exactly what speed to go off at and you
have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.480> have<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.690> commitment<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.320> at

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
have to have the commitment to go off at

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.050 
have to have the commitment to go off at
high<00:01:28.560> enough<00:01:28.770> speed<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.400> evolution<00:01:29.610> nine

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
high enough speed the evolution nine

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.340 
high enough speed the evolution nine
that<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.780> we've<00:01:30.960> been<00:01:31.080> running<00:01:31.230> for

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that we have here we've been running for

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
that we have here we've been running for
three<00:01:31.470> years<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.250> extremely<00:01:32.550> well

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
three years it's extremely well

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
three years it's extremely well
developed<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.330> gravel<00:01:33.659> already<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.500> we're

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
developed for gravel already so we're

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
developed for gravel already so we're
using<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.550> because<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.300> something

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
using it here now because it's something

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
using it here now because it's something

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fundamental changes so we've been

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
fundamental changes so we've been
working<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> evo<00:01:56.940> 10<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.260> the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
technical perspective it's superior in

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.770 
technical perspective it's superior in
every<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.490> first<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.360> built<00:02:06.690> an

every way and I first time I built an

EVO 10 I went out of the box and won a
