00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
going to punch a hole in the corner of

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.140 
going to punch a hole in the corner of
the<00:03:51.700> top<00:03:51.910> note<00:03:52.120> by<00:03:52.300> here<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:57.670> punch<00:03:57.940> that

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
the top note by here and I punch that

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.960 
the top note by here and I punch that
hole<00:03:58.420> at<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.840> larger<00:03:59.560> size<00:03:59.770> I'm<00:04:00.760> not<00:04:00.910> even

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
hole at the larger size I'm not even

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.990 
hole at the larger size I'm not even
sure<00:04:01.240> what<00:04:01.600> size<00:04:01.780> they<00:04:02.110> they<00:04:02.950> are<00:04:02.980> theirs<00:04:03.340> too

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
sure what size they they are theirs too

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.270 
sure what size they they are theirs too
I<00:04:04.270> think<00:04:04.510> it's<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.720> three<00:04:04.930> sixteenth<00:04:05.440> size<00:04:05.770> hole

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.050 
I think it's a three sixteenth size hole
and<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.720> can<00:04:07.990> put<00:04:08.140> this<00:04:08.410> jumbo<00:04:09.160> eyelet<00:04:09.880> in

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
and so I can put this jumbo eyelet in

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.840 
and so I can put this jumbo eyelet in
the<00:04:10.209> corner<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.570> this<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.430> I'm<00:04:12.490> just<00:04:12.550> going<00:04:12.790> to
