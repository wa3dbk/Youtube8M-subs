00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.449
 how the satellite remains in 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.700
 orbit 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.490
 the answer seems easy through the use 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.920
 they are going to get an appointment what 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.630
 helps them stay in orbit, but it will be a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 answer so easy 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 Let's start at the beginning, the better. 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 go back a few centuries until the isaac era 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.220
 newton 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 when he asked us birth what 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.279
 The earth is perfectly upright and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 we meet on a mountain 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.869
 self-sufficient experience and with 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.429
 an equally powerful cannon would be 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.369
 possible to expect a ball with speed 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.440
 enough to go around the earth will 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.660
 it may seem an exaggerated idea but the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.430
 truth is that there behind the reason for the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 which the satellite remain life 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 run at the time knew that the idea was 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 just that an idea but anyway 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 It found an answer to that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.010
 you know that the earth is supposed to be 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 next round 83 son imagine that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.579
 round to find out if at the time 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.559
 a person walks the eight kilometers 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.600
 along the curvature of the earth creates 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.520
 five meters during this walk 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.949
 but this does not answer the question as it is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 that you gave it to us we need 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.549
 understand the concept 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.689
 imagine you off a rock 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.130
 still a cliff 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.260
 also imagine that the acceleration 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.840
 of our planet is 10 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.909
 meters per second instead of the usual ones 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.530
 9.8 meters per second this one more time 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.299
 to facilitate the effect three children 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
 knowing that the stone does not have the speed 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.740
 we will not be able to measure the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.960
 speed and distance traveled by the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.549
 second second stone we can 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.350
 observe that in the first second stone 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.600
 has acquired a speed of 10 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 meter per second while traveling 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.380
 with five meters in the second second 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.689
 has a speed of 20 meters per 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 second and travel 20 meters while in 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.610
 according to the speed was 30 meters 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 per second is 55 meters and so on 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.490
 below can all be calculated with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.530
 this formula 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 but the important door of it all is that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.430
 has a falling object a book that does not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 have the opening senate just because you 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.720
 fall 5 meters in a second 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.130
 Wait, is not it time for that? 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.799
 eight kilometers along the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 curvature, or else by a 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.110
 The object to be in orbit is to have a 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.979
 speed of 8 kilometers per second 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.380
 of course it has an approximate speed 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.369
 and would only be valid at the surface level 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.050
 terrestrial 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.340
 they know that gravity weakens with 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.840
 In the distance I mean that the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.879
 satellite as an international station 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.580
 only have to travel at a speed of 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.489
 71 66 kilometers per second 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.980
 I for example copy or travel 715 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.700
 miles per second but now comes 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 the question 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.349
 we know that the satellite has a propeller that 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.849
 help them maintain the speed of sari 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.500
 but then how do I write to 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.840
 earth is able to keep its orbit in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.049
 around the sun there are proportions 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.970
 are going to assume that the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.769
 laws of physics do not fail and that the earth 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.549
 do not be praised toward the sun to 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.220
 your end 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.410
 This plan is next video has 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.510
