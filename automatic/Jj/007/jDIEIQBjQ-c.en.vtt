00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:05.910
 Now everything is small and wireless in fashion. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.189
 Well, we do not lag behind, so we present to you a series 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.080
 reviews about wireless mice rap - they just 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.780
 wireless, small and interesting. 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.110
 Hello everyone, this is online store fotos.ua my name is 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.320
 Max, and this is our first in line mouse-rapoo 3710P. 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:34.370
 Let's start with the design - rather unusual 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.310
 for a mouse, for some reason does it remind me of a shoe? I'm true 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.600
 I didn’t understand why they made her that way, I suspect 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
 That this is a purely design decision. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.799
 In general, it looks interesting. 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.989
 Gloss on top, everything I like, rubberized on the sides 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.239
 inserts that fingers did not slide. 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.809
 It is convenient to keep it, although it is too small for my 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:53.809
 arms. 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.350
 True if you consider that this mouse is more likely to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 laptop, then do not have to complain. 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.960
 The mouse operates at 5 GHz, so that your other 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439
 should not interfere with wireless devices. 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.390
 Laser sensor, so it works in principle everywhere 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.060
 besides glass, even your leg fits. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.600
 6 buttons. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.009
 Left-right-scroll, two side and a toggle button 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.479
 DPI. 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.950
 Switches to either 800 or 1600 DPI. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 When switching to green, the green light flashes 2 times, at 800 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.409
 one. 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 He also flashes when you connect the mouse. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.090
 This is done simply: delay the back of a little bit 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.700
 back and down, well, like in the picture. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.910
 Insert 2 AAA batteries, return, back 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.310
 panel in place, turn it on, and insert the USB receiver 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.409
 into a laptop or computer. 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.850
 Windows will install drivers and can be used. 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.649
 By the way, I want to talk about drivers in more detail. 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.509
 First, if they are not set, the side buttons will not 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.350
 work, secondly there is surprisingly a wide selection 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.829
 programming keys. 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.649
 Especially pleased with the item "Windows 8", as you can see, rapoo 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.850
 keep up with the times. 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.979
 In general, you can configure keys like 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.920
 it's convenient, and I like that. 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.640
 Firewood swing from the official site, they are there very easy 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 to find. 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 The manufacturer claims that the battery lasts for 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.820
 9 months. 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.750
 Well, I can’t check it but I think at least 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 3 months will last, at rapoo all devices consume 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.970
 minimum energy. 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.240
 Someone on the Internet wrote that 2 weeks exactly works. 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.700
 In general, you will immediately see that the battery sits 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940
 - the indicator should light up here. 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.230
 In general, the mouse is small, with a good sensor, and that 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680
 importantly, a lot of space does not take. 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.940
 I threw it into the bag for the laptop and went, in our time such 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.590
 devices are appreciated.
