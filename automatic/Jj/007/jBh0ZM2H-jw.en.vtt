00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
35 and exchange off a pair of nights
which<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:28.529> bring<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.189> black<00:00:29.429> knight<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:30.029> an

the bishop on g7 and makes blacks
position<00:00:43.190> easier<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> handle<00:00:46.250> Bishop<00:00:47.250> f4<00:00:47.610> we

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
position easier to handle Bishop f4 we

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.819 
position easier to handle Bishop f4 we
mentioned<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.899> idea<00:00:48.960> earlier<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> white

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
mentioned the idea earlier of white

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.470 
mentioned the idea earlier of white
having<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> problem<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.610> his<00:00:50.820> bishop<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> c1

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
having a problem with his bishop on c1

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.520 
having a problem with his bishop on c1
and<00:00:53.000> in<00:00:54.000> several<00:00:54.600> games<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.989> saw<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> bishop

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and in several games we saw the bishop

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
and in several games we saw the bishop
coming<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> g5<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.520> time<00:00:56.789> white<00:00:57.719> puts<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
coming to g5 this time white puts the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.979 
coming to g5 this time white puts the
bishop<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.710> f4<00:00:59.340> with<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> hope<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.539> think

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
bishop on on f4 with the hope I think

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.139 
bishop on on f4 with the hope I think
and<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> long<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.219> off<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.609> eventually

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and it's a long way off of eventually

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.100 
and it's a long way off of eventually
getting<00:01:03.329> round<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> play<00:01:03.930> e4<00:01:04.500> e5<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:06.990> you

avoided that advance I mean you could

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.340 
avoided that advance I mean you could
leave<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> night<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> suppose<00:01:39.350> black

pointed out fails miserably tonight d3

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.399 
pointed out fails miserably tonight d3
and<00:01:47.360> already<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> Black<00:01:48.720> Knight<00:01:48.930> has<00:01:49.170> reached

a very very strong position because of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.289 
a very very strong position because of

White's<00:01:58.049> position<00:01:58.409> collapses<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> house

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
White's position collapses like a house

White's position collapses like a house
of<00:01:59.310> cards<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.619> helps<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> explain

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
of cards so all this helps to explain

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.569 
of cards so all this helps to explain
why<00:02:02.360> black<00:02:03.360> took<00:02:03.570> off<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> night<00:02:04.579> black

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
why black took off the night black

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.240 
why black took off the night black
recaptures<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> night

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
recaptures with the night

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.780 
recaptures with the night
and<00:02:09.250> now<00:02:09.399> Bishop<00:02:09.729> takes<00:02:09.940> e5<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.760> a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and now Bishop takes e5 and this is a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.449
