buy<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.380> new<00:00:38.590> wallet<00:00:38.800> for<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.190> long<00:00:39.430> time

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
buy a new wallet for a long time

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.729 
buy a new wallet for a long time
especially<00:00:40.750> since<00:00:41.260> they<00:00:41.379> have<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.559> lifetime

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
especially since they have a lifetime

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.380 
especially since they have a lifetime
guarantee<00:00:41.980> I'll<00:00:42.609> probably<00:00:42.820> never<00:00:43.059> need<00:00:43.359> to

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390

guarantee I'll probably never need to
buy<00:00:43.629> another<00:00:43.780> wallet<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.410> can<00:00:44.559> just<00:00:44.710> get<00:00:44.800> it

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
your interview changed a little bit of

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.290 
your interview changed a little bit of
the<00:00:51.160> patch<00:00:51.489> setup<00:00:51.879> here

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
the patch setup here

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.029 
the patch setup here
I<00:00:52.329> previously<00:00:52.929> added<00:00:53.469> don't<00:00:53.620> tread<00:00:53.890> on<00:00:53.920> me

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
I previously added don't tread on me

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.149 
I previously added don't tread on me
patch<00:00:54.429> on<00:00:54.699> there<00:00:54.879> as<00:00:55.030> well<00:00:55.739> made<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.859> a<00:00:56.920> little

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
patch on there as well made it a little

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.340 
patch on there as well made it a little
bit<00:00:57.460> too<00:00:57.940> wide<00:00:58.149> as<00:00:58.449> far<00:00:58.659> as<00:00:58.749> the<00:00:58.839> patches<00:00:59.230> on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
bit too wide as far as the patches on

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.899 
bit too wide as far as the patches on
there<00:00:59.530> kind<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.920> overhung<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.399> little<00:01:00.760> bit

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
there kind of overhung a little bit

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.459 
there kind of overhung a little bit
could<00:01:01.210> get<00:01:01.329> snagged<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.019> pocket<00:01:02.409> or

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
could get snagged in a pocket or

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.950 
could get snagged in a pocket or
whatever<00:01:02.739> so<00:01:03.519> I<00:01:03.550> lowered<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.390> lowered<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
whatever so I lowered it lowered the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.510 
whatever so I lowered it lowered the
profile<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.560> little<00:01:05.650> bit<00:01:05.980> keeping<00:01:06.370> my

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
profile a little bit keeping my

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.469 
profile a little bit keeping my
essential<00:01:07.000> information<00:01:07.570> on<00:01:07.780> there<00:01:09.479> there's

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
essential information on there there's

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.370 
essential information on there there's
something<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:10.840> think<00:01:11.050> everyone<00:01:11.350> should

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
something I think everyone should

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.320 
something I think everyone should
consider<00:01:11.890> if<00:01:12.070> they<00:01:12.220> have<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.550> opportunity<00:01:13.150> to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
consider if they have the opportunity to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.240 
consider if they have the opportunity to
have<00:01:13.480> hook-and-loop<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.350> wallet<00:01:15.010> or

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
have hook-and-loop on a wallet or

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.210 
have hook-and-loop on a wallet or
perhaps<00:01:16.150> wear<00:01:16.510> bracelets<00:01:17.140> or<00:01:17.500> if<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.040> want<00:01:18.160> to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
perhaps wear bracelets or if you want to

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.060 
perhaps wear bracelets or if you want to
put<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.490> your<00:01:18.670> plate<00:01:18.880> carrier<00:01:19.360> or<00:01:19.660> a<00:01:20.230> note

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
put it on your plate carrier or a note

can just give you blood that will work
in<00:01:34.990> your<00:01:35.020> case<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:35.920> not<00:01:36.040> going<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.280> be<00:01:36.400> that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
in your case it's not going to be that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.700 
in your case it's not going to be that
critical<00:01:36.870> but<00:01:37.870> something<00:01:38.200> like<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.350> penicillin

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
critical but something like a penicillin

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.860 
critical but something like a penicillin
allergy<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:40.180> could<00:01:40.330> honestly<00:01:40.690> make<00:01:40.840> a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
allergy that that could honestly make a

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.320 
allergy that that could honestly make a
huge<00:01:41.230> difference<00:01:41.650> as<00:01:41.770> far<00:01:41.950> as<00:01:42.070> whether<00:01:42.330> you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
huge difference as far as whether you

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.210 
huge difference as far as whether you
receive<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:44.020> thing<00:01:44.470> that's<00:01:44.620> going<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.890> make<00:01:45.040> you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
receive a thing that's going to make you

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.970 
receive a thing that's going to make you
substantially<00:01:45.790> worse<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.410> it's<00:01:47.410> just<00:01:47.560> easier

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
substantially worse and it's just easier

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.070 
substantially worse and it's just easier
to<00:01:48.160> give<00:01:48.370> people<00:01:48.700> access<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.540> information

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
to give people access to the information

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.380 
to give people access to the information
if<00:01:50.230> they<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.830> me<00:01:51.040> knocked<00:01:51.790> out<00:01:52.000> on<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.210> side

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
if they see me knocked out on the side

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.300 
if they see me knocked out on the side
of<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.570> road<00:01:52.750> people<00:01:53.740> are<00:01:53.830> gonna<00:01:53.950> look<00:01:54.130> for

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
of the road people are gonna look for

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.680 
of the road people are gonna look for
identification<00:01:54.700> they're<00:01:55.090> gonna<00:01:55.180> look<00:01:55.420> at<00:01:55.570> my

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
identification they're gonna look at my

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.870 
identification they're gonna look at my
wallet<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.280> think<00:01:57.370> there's<00:01:57.580> something<00:01:57.850> that

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
wallet so I think there's something that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.700 
wallet so I think there's something that
a<00:01:58.000> lot<00:01:58.120> of<00:01:58.210> people<00:01:58.420> should<00:01:58.540> consider<00:01:58.960> having

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
a lot of people should consider having

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.740 
a lot of people should consider having
with<00:02:00.070> their<00:02:00.280> wallet<00:02:00.640> for<00:02:01.120> me<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.360> makes<00:02:01.510> sense

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
with their wallet for me it makes sense

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.090 
with their wallet for me it makes sense
to<00:02:01.900> just<00:02:01.990> have<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.230> on<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.410> outside<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.070> has

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
to just have it on the outside it has

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.220 
to just have it on the outside it has
hook-and-loop<00:02:03.700> why<00:02:03.940> not<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.690> once<00:02:04.870> again<00:02:04.990> this

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
hook-and-loop why not so once again this

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.920 
hook-and-loop why not so once again this
is<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.500> kryptek<00:02:05.980> pattern<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.630> took<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:07.780> my

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
is in the kryptek pattern I took all my

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.199 
is in the kryptek pattern I took all my
cards<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.379> stuff<00:02:08.590> out<00:02:08.769> of<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.160> few<00:02:09.640> things<00:02:10.060> I

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
cards and stuff out of it a few things I

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.360 
cards and stuff out of it a few things I
will<00:02:10.269> say<00:02:10.390> about<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:12.280> oh<00:02:13.349> yeah<00:02:14.349> -<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:15.069> lot

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
will say about it is one oh yeah - a lot

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.190 
will say about it is one oh yeah - a lot
of<00:02:15.400> things<00:02:15.670> as<00:02:16.000> similar<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> other<00:02:16.629> wallets<00:02:17.080> as

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
of things as similar to other wallets as

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.069 
of things as similar to other wallets as
far<00:02:17.379> as<00:02:17.499> this<00:02:17.650> plastic<00:02:18.719> window<00:02:19.719> if<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.019> want

far as this plastic window if you want

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.130 
far as this plastic window if you want
to<00:02:20.260> call<00:02:20.409> it<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:21.280> will<00:02:21.609> start<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.420> in

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
to call it that it will start to like in

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.960 
to call it that it will start to like in
card<00:02:23.650> numbers<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.460> so<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.730> instance

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
card numbers on it and so for instance

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.080 
card numbers on it and so for instance
if<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.120> had<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> credit<00:02:25.480> card<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.930> here<00:02:26.050> facing<00:02:26.560> up

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
if I had a credit card in here facing up

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.070 
if I had a credit card in here facing up
eventually<00:02:28.090> you'd<00:02:28.210> start<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:28.960> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
eventually you'd start to have like the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.620 
eventually you'd start to have like the
numbers<00:02:29.440> kind<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.890> edge<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.030> their<00:02:31.150> way<00:02:31.330> into

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
numbers kind of edge to their way into

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.780 
numbers kind of edge to their way into
the<00:02:31.930> rubber<00:02:32.110> they're<00:02:32.640> rubbery<00:02:33.640> plastic

the rubber they're rubbery plastic
whatever<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.510> stuff<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.310> ended<00:02:36.460> up

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
whatever this stuff is and so I ended up

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.520 
whatever this stuff is and so I ended up
taking<00:02:36.760> my<00:02:37.000> cards<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.540> flipping<00:02:37.930> them<00:02:38.080> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
taking my cards and flipping them to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.800 
taking my cards and flipping them to
where<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.980> signature<00:02:39.400> part<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.030> facing<00:02:40.630> up

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
where the signature part is facing up

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.710 
where the signature part is facing up
and<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:42.340> works<00:02:42.610> fine<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.820> me<00:02:43.060> honestly<00:02:43.540> makes

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
and it works fine for me honestly makes

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.240 
and it works fine for me honestly makes
no<00:02:43.990> difference<00:02:44.200> or<00:02:44.560> taking<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> card<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
no difference or taking the card to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.920 
no difference or taking the card to
enter<00:02:45.370> out<00:02:45.640> it's<00:02:46.210> just<00:02:46.420> something<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:46.900> that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
enter out it's just something so that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.080 
enter out it's just something so that
hey<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.710> don't<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.340> full<00:02:48.550> digits<00:02:48.970> of

I've had that happen with other wallet
and<00:02:52.780> other<00:02:53.020> window<00:02:53.350> things<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.010> not<00:02:54.070> like

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
and other window things so it's not like

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.770 
and other window things so it's not like
it's<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.550> flaw<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.150> just<00:02:55.300> kind<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.570> how<00:02:55.720> the

it's a flaw it's just kind of how the
system<00:02:56.110> works

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
possibly can it almost could be like

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.740 
possibly can it almost could be like
just<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.250> double<00:03:15.610> fold<00:03:15.790> wallet<00:03:16.270> based<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
just a double fold wallet based on the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.320 
just a double fold wallet based on the
size<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.290> thing<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.850> cash<00:03:19.060> too

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
size of this thing because the cash too

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.170 
size of this thing because the cash too
literally<00:03:19.600> has<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.220> much<00:03:21.400> extra<00:03:21.820> room<00:03:22.030> in

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
literally has so much extra room in

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.540 
literally has so much extra room in
there<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.620> could<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.890> could<00:03:24.040> have<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> bill

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
there you could you could have a bill

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.979 
there you could you could have a bill
that's<00:03:24.850> like<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.239> size<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.630> euro<00:03:25.900> or

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
that's like the size of a euro or

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.600 
that's like the size of a euro or
something<00:03:26.440> fitting<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.830> there<00:03:26.950> that's<00:03:27.430> maybe

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
something fitting in there that's maybe

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.920 
something fitting in there that's maybe
a<00:03:27.730> stupid<00:03:28.060> comparison<00:03:28.540> because<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.720> don't<00:03:28.870> know
