00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 I want to tell how very simple 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.140
 grow a lettuce not when he 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.540
 I did not succeed because I always 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.179
 very thick sowed in the hope that i will 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 thin out to eat but 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.150
 almost never it does not come to pass by 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.020
 for various reasons this year I planted 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 his seedlings in three days 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.189
 seedlings have risen to the stage of two or three 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.450
 these leaves I planted it on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.090
 permanent place in the garden well here it is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 it was somewhere in the beginning of May now with us 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.950
 the end of June two months have passed and we can 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950
 watch 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:51.390
 formation formation 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.050
 Coch's such a handsome one 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 neat instead of a special bed 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.039
 separate under the salad I did not have on 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.800
 that moment of disembarking because 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.220
 the plot is only being developed therefore I 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.460
 put him where I was 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.200
 place in particular on a flower bed with 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.670
 perennials here please on the edge 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 beds made its landing I turned 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.640
 decorative salad of course will have 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 remove when a little bit older but 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:36.530
 from this combo decoration certainly not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.530
 loses here 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.400
 this is one option to plant among 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.380
 perennials or among annuals 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.380
 if you have a place there 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.960
 another option of planting a salad can 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.640
 be among 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.670
 annual garden crops particular 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.260

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:23.900
 cabbage will grow so we double 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.040
 use the living space and also I 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.480
 I read that the salad repels insects 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.750
 cabbage pests mask her smell 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:40.840
 so far no cabbage 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.840
 Caterpillars and other parasites I do not observe 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.150
 or another example here I mix 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:59.350

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:24.280
 I also took the leaves 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.280

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:45.340

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.700

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:58.000
 have some time very pretty 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:04:00.730
 garden bed to collect lettuce and 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.070
 eat it is desirable root 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.680
 leave in the soil 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:10.600
 according to the rules of natural farming 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.310
 because you leave something 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.750
 organic in the soil will start 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:21.280
 overheat and therefore food and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.090
 plus the soil structure will be preserved and even 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.630
 will improve 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:30.570
 so in order to cut this one 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.840
 kachanchik we use scissors and 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:41.040
 try not pulling out the soils and 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:46.800

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:52.410

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:56.310
