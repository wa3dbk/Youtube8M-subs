00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
which is kind of unconventional nowadays

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.350 
which is kind of unconventional nowadays
especially<00:01:04.469> since<00:01:05.219> the<00:01:05.369> most<00:01:05.519> popular<00:01:06.090> screen

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

sizes are either 5 inches or 5.5 but
what's<00:01:10.560> special<00:01:10.710> about<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> even<00:01:12.090> though

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what's special about it is even though

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.740 
what's special about it is even though
it<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> 5.3<00:01:13.409> inch<00:01:13.560> screen<00:01:14.010> its<00:01:14.670> size<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it has a 5.3 inch screen its size is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.710
