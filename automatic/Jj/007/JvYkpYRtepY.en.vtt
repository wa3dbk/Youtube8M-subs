00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.759
 today I bring you the best 5 stunts 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.190
 of the week number 39 and in this week 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.799
 we are going to have something very special in this 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.660
 week we will have an epic acrobatics 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.340
 that all of you are going to like is 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.440
 of those weeks where they see acrobatics 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.180
 that they will almost never see each other again 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.310
 be prepared because what you are going to see 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.870
 it's amazing also makes them love them 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.910
 remember that in the previous video I have 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.220
 the rules to participate in the top 5 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.920
 remember that I do not accept montages not 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.780
 I accept the wrap or none of those things like that 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.780
 that we are going to start already with these weeks 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.340
 in position number 5 that is to have eros 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.739
 and gaming that will send us a 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.260
 acrobatics very very good cleans without 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.750
 turbos or aids or anything like you can see 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.300
 well here with the kauai tail bike the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.829
 cuchi and come here do a bounce with 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.260
 that takes all the necessary momentum 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.510
 to climb to the roof of this building and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 what is going to get cleanly eros and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.260
 game and very good acrobatics for 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.149
 start the first top 5 let's see the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.520
 repetition as it comes without help or anything 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.799
 I grab bounce that is out there by live 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.170
 in vader and comes to take all the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.030
 speed and the momentum needed to 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.030
 get to the roof part of this one 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.070
 in position number 4 we will have to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.960
 Mr. stunt the one who stops giving him the the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.789
 hell I decided to leave the intro because I'm 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 the best youtuber the coolest and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.600
 Watch cylinder waker as well as can 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.539
 see here is another chromas to equal without 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.549
 turbos if it does not help and that visually 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.140
 look amazing with all the speed with 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.689
 the back click that made to reach the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.429
 roof of this other building almost very 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.649
 similar to the past but this time 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.750
 they change buildings and it 's visually 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.759
 it looks much better that's why we 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.979
 convinced to put it later in 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.659
 the top 5 as you can see they only come with 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.220
 the speed of him and his bike doing 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.110
 little horses to grab much more 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.090
 momentum when it reaches the part of the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.429
 lighting vader building grabs there 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.200
 a few rare bounces grabs all the 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.420
 speed of the back click to get 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 here to the roof of the building and really 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.340
 it looks very good approval 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.140
 at number 3 with our new 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.260
 medals we have since the week 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.440
 last we will have a mix 21 who will 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.950
 be an acrobatics that takes 150 minutes 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.290
 in it literally more than 2 hours 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730
 there were about 30 more minutes left to make 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.920
 people but let's see her in the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.080
 repeat we see how it comes without turbo 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.000
 without any of that and come here grab 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 this bounce completely changes the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.800
 profile of the bike giving it to the side 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.140
 right and it comes to the part of this 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.430
 very good building for number 3 of 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.430
 edomex 28 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.640
 and we are getting closer to the best 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.130
 more epic this week but before 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.570
 we have a william gamer that if not 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.640
 it would have been because of the acrobatics 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.560
 in number 1 this would have been the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.900
 better and probably the others if 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.240
 were going up in level but grain that 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.460
 according to liang eimer here is very very sexy 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.350
 grab the turbo to grab all the 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.050
 speed needed because the time that 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.810
 it stays in the air is amazing and it's going to 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.970
 get to this part of the dome that is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.950
 as a kind of a bonus pipe 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.930
 I know well that it is but the truth is that it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.360
 he sees very very well in acrobatics 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.190
 it takes too long in the air that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.710
 it costs us hard, it costs us work 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.960
 decide if it's a person or is it a 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.090
 seagull or is superman or what is it 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.680
 It's flying but it's from William Gamer 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.930
 that Croatia sends us for the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.760
 number 2 very very good and now yes 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.760
 we have the best of this week 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.370
 and prepare yourself because we have the best and 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.080
 to the gold post that is of original mx and 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.709
 what they are going to see is amazing so 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.709
 enjoy 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.159
 or 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.849
 slow because they are those acrobatics that 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.920
 I say you will not see it again see 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.319
 what speed does start to do 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.459
 some pirouettes and they say it is not going to stop me 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.620
 one I go for the next one and pass it 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.100
 incredibly perfect crazy headquarters 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.590
 original mx is crazy it 's something very 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.900
 very difficult because if they realize what 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.500
 does with speed and does it by turning 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.080
 and do not touch at all touch and 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.850
 lightning in quoted my god please that 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.780
 hire this person as aviator 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.780
 professional 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.580
 so good very good acrobatics 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.050
 original mx for the best of the week 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.430
 as I told you something that very rarely 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.139
 they will see him again 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.090
