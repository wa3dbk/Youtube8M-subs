00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.840
 hello how 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.689
 here I will show you a stitch 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.479
 let's start with two very strong chains 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.610
 let's see this meeting which has different names 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.099
 he avoided being called a shell stitch 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.199
 I have also seen that they call it arc stitch 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.609
 Well, I call it a stitch pen because it figures as I knew it. 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.369
 we are going to weave a series of chains here 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 for you to learn is targeted 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.249
 as we can 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.070
 percent 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.520
 ride it 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.300
 about the chains 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.130
 learning how to mount the on the chains is easier 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.730
 to mount it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 about our stitch either capital 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.690
 ok of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.850
 high points or points goes of state half tips 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.520
 or any other point 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.900
 well look I'm going to start is pointed here I'm going to weave three chains 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900
 because I'm going to mount it 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.250
 about the closing 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.470
 a step 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.239
 of high pontos 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.700
 have to what is the beginning of the stitch and in the end 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.310
 this is so that you are not due 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 a height d next to the clumsy both in what is the shore 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.660
 feel each of the extremes 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.540
 then having yemen two high points I'm going here to take one thrown by 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.430
 what will I do another high point 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.670
 and I'm going to pass two chains and in the third string there I'm going to put 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.910
 a high point 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.479
 then I will grab another one the last one and in the next point 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.580
 of the chain 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.210
 there I will put another high point 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.390
 to have two high points 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.010
 it is targeted we can do it based on two high points 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.200
 Herb three or four or five 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 in it, depending on how you like it here, we will see it from 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.030
 to be 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 2 the chain 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.150
 also Guadalajara that these two high points 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.880
 so you can see how it is 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.500
 we have three chains 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.860
 we take the fairies 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.080
 and we will continue in the next chain we will knit 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.539
 a high point 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.539
 again another high point in the next chain 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.979
 because this is why I call it flight feathers stitch so that's how I 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.309
 taught because it is with a feather towards Cali to here 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.579
 well, now 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.829
 let's pass two chains and in the third we will vote 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.039
 another high point 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:35.739
 it's basically counted as you already saw it two high points continued 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.509
 three chains 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.579
 in the following chains 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.019
 let's fix 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.299
 another high point in the chain that follows 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.479
 another high point 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.289
 and so on this is basically the stitch 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:55.239
 two high points that are inclined to have two chains 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.359
 then three chains up and another one of the high points that continue 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.159
 cement it chain 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.089
 then we are going to leave another separation of two chains to start our 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.990
 cover basically this first half pole 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.399
 between the stitch 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.159
 and you the usual 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.450
 Algaba as you want depending on what you are going to knit 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.349
 and as you like it 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.349
 then here two high points three chains 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:28.340
 we continue weaving two high points the chains that we left 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.970
 at the bottom and the chains that we leave all the top 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:33.939
 are the ones that give us 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.959
 our shaping our percent jumps up so that they lean look 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.860
 that's the way we're staying and basically this is the stitch 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.650
 they remain here arquitos shock for that reason they call arch 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.239
 and point with chad because I believe because you stay 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.719
 percent or ice creams to one side and to the other 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.549
 then here in the third chain 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.270
 sometimes 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.860
 what could we do if we do it, for example, it is aimed instead of doing 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.669
 pointed out that we made double high point 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.539
 we can let go instead of two chains 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.789
 we let three chains pass 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:15.129
 and that way we're left was a little thinner because if this point that 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.489
 we do here we do it higher 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.169
 when you have to tilt so much 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.169
 yes we pass only two chains 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.680
 Look, that's how the stitch works 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.550
 in this way 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.870
 so they can appreciate it that's why 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.680
 ee 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.930
 well, they call it a feather because you want 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.419
 as feather 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.999
 well I see it that way 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.249
 well that's how we have left then lara tip 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.740
 and here it was not enough to knit another feather, so what I'm going to do is 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.240
 let two chains pass and in the third 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.550
 there is good insert a high point 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.370
 and in which another high point follows 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.160
 taking as finished the turn that is how we are left 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.999
 to get the second round we only rotate the fabric we fix three chains 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:08.969
 And in the next point remember this name in which you decide 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.309
 there we will ride 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:12.620
 a high point 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.529
 and here how do we continue flight now let's weave the high points 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.870
 inside of 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.080
 the chains that are flying 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.490
 here we are going to knit 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.470
 both 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.520
 high points 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.860
 Exxon those who go with our tip the three chains 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.740
 and two other high points inside 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.700
 of what is the arch of the chains without taking the chain e inside the meals 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.259
 kast is very easy 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.590
 here we again grab thrown to make another high point on the next 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:44.839
 today he insisted 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.939
 it is told is very easy 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.080
 since as we do not have to go grabbing the points just what 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.949
 we put 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.490
 inside the arch of the chains 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.490
 it's a very easy and very fast stitch 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:01.329
 Look, this is how our second round is going to be 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.139
 let's make another 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.449
 here 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.770
 two high points three chains 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.770
 i in the same building 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
 two high points 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.539
 so that in this way 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.610
 those who see 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.430
 a little bit belgrade 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.460
 what is the tissue 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.979
 and it was like a stitch b from chicago 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.110
 this is what you want 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.409
 although this will 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.729
 It is told is very used for the kun and gypsy 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.819
 to census veritas 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.439
 or to do even oeyen 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.830
 the edges of a napkin 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.979
 oo 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.639
 they even look for it as a ribbon 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.009
 as it has here the holes here pass the ribbon can also 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:00.589
 use in this way 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:02.919
 and we finished very well again 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.539
 with two high points 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:05.419
 what was 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.219
 we answer our return 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:10.849
 here we say is targeted end increases 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.300
 so that's why some people wanted to put the two high points on 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.339
 principle the high points at the end so that it is straight 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.339
 our network and postures 

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.800
 for our 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.129
 our kingfisher 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.880
 this is the stitch so this is how it is here they call 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.719
 Seeing a little the little pits 

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:33.520
 and I hope you like it 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.180
 I'm fine until the next
