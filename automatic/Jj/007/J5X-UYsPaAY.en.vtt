00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
even heard of this series in terms of

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.600 
even heard of this series in terms of
horror<00:04:13.060> we<00:04:13.330> have<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> quantity<00:04:14.170> versus<00:04:14.530> quality

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
horror we have a quantity versus quality

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.719 
horror we have a quantity versus quality
situation<00:04:15.610> Metro<00:04:16.510> 2033<00:04:16.660> had<00:04:17.590> far<00:04:18.100> more<00:04:18.130> horror

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729

segments<00:04:19.269> than<00:04:19.419> metro<00:04:19.600> last<00:04:19.870> light<00:04:20.079> but<00:04:20.500> I

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
segments than metro last light but I

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.590 
segments than metro last light but I
tend<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.250> think<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.549> last<00:04:21.880> night<00:04:22.150> had<00:04:22.330> much

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
tend to think that last night had much

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.040 
tend to think that last night had much
better<00:04:23.260> ones<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:25.000> tough<00:04:25.240> choice<00:04:25.270> but

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
better ones it's a tough choice but

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.930 
better ones it's a tough choice but
luckily<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:27.010> can't<00:04:27.280> go<00:04:27.460> wrong<00:04:27.639> with<00:04:27.910> either

you're planning it I think the main
reason<00:05:36.250> for<00:05:36.729> this<00:05:37.030> is<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.479> lack<00:05:37.720> of<00:05:37.750> music

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
reason for this is the lack of music
