00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.390
 what are the therapeutic properties 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:07.370
 then the aloe a different 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.280
 therapeutic properties 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.800
 the most important is to prevent 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.720
 the infections of the injured skin therefore 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.550
 particularly and very wounds 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.419
 we say important to use it when 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.460
 however the wounds are not very deep is 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.499
 it is inadvisable to use it when 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.390
 the wounds are deep because it takes 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.870
 much more time if you will use it 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.859
 to heal on a gastrointestinal level 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.219
 here is gastrointestinal and we say from us 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.750
 naturopaths is very recommended to him is 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.629
 because we really see frequently 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.620
 that there are many issues 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.519
 own issues 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.309
 bowel 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.320
 therefore it can also be considered a 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.030
 anti constipation loi then comes 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.219
 recommended however also for those who have 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.949
 digestive problems of constipation 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.420
 and it is also detoxifying then in 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:06.320
 scope we say draining and depurative e 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.820
 in silicon the year the gel is used 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.470
 so if one cuts right in two the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.440
 say the leaf of it is just the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.510
 therefore he sees that in a particular way 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 it is also used by 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.620
 put on wounds as we have seen 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.200
 before then as a soothing of the 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.020
 then wound the main substance 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.830
 gel the gel 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 then of course and the other coming 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.970
 used by us and that is drunk and comes 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 elaborate so it is not what a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.000
 draws there and then we say from the plant 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.160
 then comes naturally worked and the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.850
 it is also considered a plant 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.980
 miraculous as there are 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.590
 active substances contained in law e 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:57.140
 therefore vitamins aece b1 b2 b3 b6 b12 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.040
 and therefore to vitamin C however we know 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.430
 which is a strong activity 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.150
 antioxidant minerals calcium magnesium 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.710
 potassium manganese and copper zinc selenium 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.900
 phosphorus iron chrome sodium chlorine 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.570
 amino acids there are 18 of 22 required 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.950
 from our enzyme body then 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.660
 even these that help the right 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 digestion as we have seen before 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.230
 of proteins but important are i 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.120
 polysaccharides of these are precisely from 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.880
 year this protective effect on the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.760
 digestive tract mucosa then 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.400
 the more effective polysaccharides the loi is 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.330
 so when we choose an aloe 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.020
 in the label we have to see right 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.700
 the percentage of polysaccharides also 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.910
 we can add serves as a filter 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.260
 purifier destroys toxins 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.360
 restructure genre revitalizes mine 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.430
 oxide is this antioxidant 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.830
 however we had already seen and activated in 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.330
 specific way the immune system 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.220
 stimulates the production of endorphins and 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.980
 exerts an anti-pain action e 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.280
 more analgesic also tones e 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.410
 capillary therapeutic virtues of the bayern 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.500
 in the meantime, however, the papaya was 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.430
 then imported from Cristoforo Colombo 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.590
 with the discovery of America it is a fruit 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.720
 the tree we say of the papaya looks like 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.220
 much to the palm and this fruit we say 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.250
 it has also been called fruit of the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.500
 angels no or even the tree 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.160
 of the papaya golden tree of the eternal 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.800
 youth 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.640
 precisely because papaya is a fruit 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:36.340
 a lot we say particular and has some 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.680
 important beneficial properties and helps e 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.739
 therefore it is favorable for example for whom 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.170
 has food intolerance problems 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.820
 even digestive disorders per 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.150
 who has difficulty defining 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.360
 slag and therefore the risk of cancer 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.959
 antioxidant and some diseases that are 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.900
 considered chronic diseases one uses 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.170
 often the papaya fermented its own 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.989
 fermented is a preparation and of 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.260
 papalia fermented long at low 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.380
 temperatures with enriched yeast of 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.900
 new components including polyphenols and 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.450
 dall igo saccharides with a powerful 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.070
 assets that confer ownership 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.640
 unpublished immunostimulants 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.080
 and revitalizing so this is one here 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.930
 dad and just that he has a trial 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.280
 processing detail is also the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.290
 more used as the indications 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.960
 of the fermented papaya are really 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.170
 because it has digestive difficulties 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.760
 meteorism cellulite aging 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.140
 fatigue but stress conditions 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.400
 catarrhal inflammatory manifestations 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.400
 chronic diseases
