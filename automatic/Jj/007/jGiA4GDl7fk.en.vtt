00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.379
 BFM Business until 12:30 full 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.459
 place in the issue 100% plasmor 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.990
 the imso murray is now like every 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.549
 day we bring you ideas for 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.199
 invest your money why not 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.390
 invest in precious metals in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.189
 the gold see the silver metal we will talk about it 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.779
 with jean franÃ§ois faure hello jean 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 francois fabriol are the president of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.349
 coop points like before talking 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 money we will talk about during the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.640
 the stage gold one is still largely this 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.320
 morning under the $ 1300 for an ounce of gold 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 why the prices of the ounce of gold do not 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.490
 progresses more the piano then there we are 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.520
 actually in a logic in these 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.410
 g flat photos at the gold level 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.160
 specifically since the end of the year 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.200
 2013 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.930
 we are between two antagonistic forces 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.170
 which are on one side ukraine that grows 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.880
 rising gold and the recovery that one 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.950
 we are boasting who is trying to send the gold to 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.970
 the decline to sell us more 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.470
 more interesting things 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.790
 finally any case that's what we are 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.230
 makes believe and so today 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.090
 specifically and fairly 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.740
 basic we are really in this 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.480
 logical good and on the other hand there are some 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.270
 much bigger forces such as by 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.350
 example China who continues to buy 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.119
 massively who became the buyer the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.249
 most important in the world before India in 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.859
 2013 so there are still some fundamentals 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:18.990
 which are important I would say that in this 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.579
 moment it is to play down 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.569
 or the rise is clearly a moment 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.280
 interesting to position 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.939
 since we are in a period 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.409
 of wait 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.179
 we are in the middle of the ford exactly 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 middle of the ford we even have the averages 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.259
 mobiles over 20 weeks that are also 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.819
 extremely flat therefore means that the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.229
 gold price a priori 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.850
 naturally if we let them go 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.100
 like that naturally will remain stable 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 for a long time 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.009
 I would say that on this first 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.189
 semester we can actually still 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.509
 have this kind of effect except events 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.389
 major geopolitics that can 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.920
 obviously all day break in hand 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:51.740
 so it's really watching from very 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 close by a word also money 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.189
 silver metal 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.569
 we hear more and more talk is this 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.340
 it's worth it to invest in 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.990
 the silver metal then the silver metal is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.520
 extremely interesting it is not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.320
 very well known to help French people 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.659
 because 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.590
 very simply in France when we 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.210
 provides information to buy silver-metal 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.740
 those who want to ask you 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.540
 to apply you the VAT on it and this 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.440
 who is actually legal or buy 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.540
 an ingot we put you the VAT so there 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.890
 it's 20% away that's still 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.780
 a lot of people 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.400
 if we look a little bit at the rest of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.890
 europe where even the united states by the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.970
 Americans buy massively from 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 silver metal because they can the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.890
 put on their booklet of 2.2 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.110
 of savings 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.280
 which are offered to them there even the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.750
 Germans buy twice as much as 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.569
 we because the VAT is lower 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.430
 so that's the problem is actually if 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.500
 we get clear information that we analyze 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.600
 a little bit the products it turns out that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.880
 some silver metal products can 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.780
 to be purchased without vat for example the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.459
 legal tender documents 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.140
 I take the case of the philharmonic of 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.209
 come with a face value of 1 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.620
 euro 50 but it's a shame so in 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.400
 does you buy an ounce of money 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 metal when you buy this product 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.560
 monique stone philharmonic 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.830
 become here in itself that allows to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.239
 circumvent the VAT legally not to 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.870
 get it applied you also have 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.280
 the tokens the silver metal medals 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.600
 etc. that are interesting and globally 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.980
 all these products besides that comes in 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.350
 in this context there it is tokens 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.750
 or currencies having legal tender 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.950
 you also have an interest on a plane 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.690
 tax since you have an exemption 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.090
 up to 5000 euros per session 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.290
 every time you sell a small 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.200
 little else like on gold on the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.239
 same on the type of products chips and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.800
 piece having legal tender you have a 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.480
 exemption below 5000 euros 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.560
 so it's very interesting so it's okay 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.300
 we play the very long term and it's a 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 first trick to get around 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.610
 legally this vat on silver metal 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.890
 there are other tricks what I do you 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.170
 mention there in relation to taxation and 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.550
 after beyond the trick it's also 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.430
 why position yourself on money 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.080
 metal and here we are in a logic of 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.790
 very long term oat to send on gold 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.190
 today the cycles are relatively 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.129
 most common play gold over 5 10 years 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.650
 gold the money has rather the 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.360
 table on 20 30 years for 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.410
 very simply industrial reasons that's 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.209
 that in 20 or 30 years we do not have 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.489
 of silver metal to go out to extract from the 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.840
 earth yes because we can not them to 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.340
 value his land that today by 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.799
 example if you take the case of gold this 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.139
 which has been extracted from the earth in matter 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.739
 from the beginning 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.259
 of the night of human times and 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.610
 we arrive then valued that 170 thousand 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.930
 tons 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.360
 we specifically where is it 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.669
 we also know how to recycle their clothes 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.439
 tight used exactly on the money 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.580
 metal it's not the same the same 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.169
 problematic it's much more 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.430
 complex and in the case for example of 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.719
 industrial products it's not even 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.759
 possible doing this you take the chips 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.210
 rfid in which one finds money 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.620
 metal 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.539
 we do not know how to revalue them 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.280
 extract the money that is to say that there in 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.409
 out of the money that was hit 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.240
 in the form of coins or ingots and 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.789
 which still remains very much in 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.610
 below 2 of world consumption 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.889
 everything else disappears volatilises 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.960
 so we're necessarily in a 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.000
 logic there term of rarefaction 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.050
 exactly of rarefaction what should 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.759
 lead to an increase in 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.099
 the silver metal you say on horizon 20 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.750
 30 yrs so beautiful when we have 60 70 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.680
 today it's not necessarily worth the 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.900
 shot of the item bought money 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.949
 metal is the one reserved for the most 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.259
 younger generations do not have 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.879
 necessarily after us we do not see 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.710
 daily in a lot of people who 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.930
 are interested in this kind of savings even 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.000
 by being old in a logic of 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.689
 transmission 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.800
 today we are still sure of 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.340
 courses that are extremely low 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.960
 in 2011 we had 1 1 an ounce of money 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.509
 which was at 56 dollars 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.950
 today we are below 20 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.070
 dollars see so 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.290
 there is still on the spot the same 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.970
 problems that we have on gold with 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.170
 another hundred wait-and-see and that's at 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.760
 level of silver metal in a 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.140
 investment logic we have pretty much 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.130
 the same effects knowing that on 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.930
 money on the other hand and that's where he 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.090
 must be very hung not too much 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.110
 to have nerves 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.660
 you are sure of the effects 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.300
 multipliers certainly when the organ 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.010
 money wins 3 very volatile and 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.170
 it's extremely volatile so you have to 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.420
 to know how to be patient not to have too much 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.190
 nose on silver metal every day and 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.730
 say this is I bought for 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.730
 future generations 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.670
 and that's where I really win 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.990
 yes , it might not be 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.580
 badly in France you said in the United States 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.380
 to products on which we can 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.910
 place his money metal products 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.160
 of spared in France it does not exist that 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.590
 no clearly not in France 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.070
 would rather like to point you towards 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.600
 strictly paper products it's very 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.500
 it's very European it's not 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.460
 worse also because there the 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.200
 Government is making efforts to 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.370
 redirect the savings towards aid to 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.200
 companies the financing of 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.760
 companies these virtuous for a but that's 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.190
 it's totally virtuous but the example 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.300
 I take quite frequently 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.440
 do not oppose a car with 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.540
 the assurance that one learns from one's 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.820
 car I will not oppose the
