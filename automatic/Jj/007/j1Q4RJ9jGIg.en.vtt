but<00:00:25.140> they<00:00:25.260> were<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.500> house<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.099> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
but they were in my house so this is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.570 
but they were in my house so this is
what<00:00:26.369> we'll<00:00:26.550> use<00:00:28.039> first<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.189> getting<00:00:29.460> them

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
what we'll use first of all getting them

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.290 
what we'll use first of all getting them
out<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.060> box<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.510> somewhat<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> trick<00:00:32.300> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
out of the box is somewhat of a trick so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.590 
out of the box is somewhat of a trick so
I'll<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:35.059> anyway<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> throw

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I'll just do that anyway I like to throw

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
I'll just do that anyway I like to throw
things<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> first<00:00:38.040> method<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> shuffling

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
things so this first method of shuffling

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
things so this first method of shuffling
cards<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> will<00:00:40.020> call<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.590> mix<00:00:40.890> them

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
cards is what I will call the mix them

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.180 
cards is what I will call the mix them
up<00:00:41.210> method<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.360> shuffling<00:00:42.899> cards<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
up method of shuffling cards and that is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.610 
up method of shuffling cards and that is
where<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.640> put<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> middle

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
where you just put them in the middle

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.959 
where you just put them in the middle
and<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.800> mix<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:48.110> look<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
and you mix them up look at that

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.770 
and you mix them up look at that
shuffling<00:00:51.410> but<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> trick<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:54.390> trying

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
shuffling but then the trick is trying

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.139 
shuffling but then the trick is trying
to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.199> back<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.219> deck<00:00:56.899> not<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.140> easy

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
to get them back into a deck not so easy

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:09.500 
to get them back into a deck not so easy
yeah<00:01:03.619> here<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:07.100> shuffled<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.090> so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
yeah here we go shuffled there you go so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
yeah here we go shuffled there you go so
that's<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:09.900> method<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.710> mix<00:01:10.950> them<00:01:11.100> up

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that's the first method the mix them up

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.090 
that's the first method the mix them up
method<00:01:11.780> okay<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.930> next<00:01:13.080> method<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.770> one

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
method okay this next method is the one

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.410 
method okay this next method is the one
I<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> call<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.150> 52<00:01:15.780> pickup<00:01:16.430> method<00:01:17.430> go

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I like to call the 52 pickup method go

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
I like to call the 52 pickup method go
something<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:22.560> method<00:01:22.799> works

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
something like this this method works

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.420 
something like this this method works

i'll do is i kind of hold them against
my<00:02:01.710> chest<00:02:02.119> i'll<00:02:03.119> split<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.899> half<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.409> so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
my chest i'll split them in half or so

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.370 
my chest i'll split them in half or so
and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:06.210> I'll<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.420> kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> mash<00:02:07.200> them

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and then I'll just kind of mash them

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
and then I'll just kind of mash them
together<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.720> then<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
together there like that and then you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.230 
together there like that and then you
can<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:11.150> how<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.360> works<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.959> there

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
can kind of see how that works so there

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.410 
can kind of see how that works so there
they're<00:02:13.420> together<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:15.850> do<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.210> so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
