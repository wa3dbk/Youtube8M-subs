00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
once every other week but is could never

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.570 
once every other week but is could never
find<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.350> ump<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.709> go<00:03:38.800> back<00:03:38.980> because<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.400> just

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
find the ump to go back because I just

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.550 
find the ump to go back because I just
had<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:40.360> changes<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.810> were<00:03:40.989> made<00:03:41.020> were<00:03:41.260> not

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
had the changes that were made were not

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800 
had the changes that were made were not
significant<00:03:42.280> enough<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.820> me<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.150> play<00:03:43.390> much

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
significant enough for me to play much

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.910 
significant enough for me to play much
differently<00:03:44.260> than<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.470> had<00:03:44.590> been<00:03:44.680> playing

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
differently than I had been playing

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.890 
differently than I had been playing
before<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.910> allowed<00:03:46.150> me<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.420> kind<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.720> just

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
before and it allowed me to kind of just

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.810 
before and it allowed me to kind of just
dominate<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.680> game<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.220> itself<00:03:48.370> even

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
dominate the game in and of itself even

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.310 
dominate the game in and of itself even
on<00:03:48.910> harder<00:03:49.209> difficulty<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.720> was<00:03:49.840> doing<00:03:49.989> pretty

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
on harder difficulty I was doing pretty

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.320 
on harder difficulty I was doing pretty
ok<00:03:50.440> had<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.130> couple<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.489> dumb<00:03:51.670> deaths<00:03:51.940> because<00:03:52.209> I

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
ok had a couple of dumb deaths because I

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.390 
ok had a couple of dumb deaths because I
just<00:03:52.450> overestimated<00:03:52.810> my<00:03:53.320> ability<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:53.860> once<00:03:54.280> I

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
just overestimated my ability but once I

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.470 
just overestimated my ability but once I
got<00:03:54.489> into<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.730> swing<00:03:54.850> of<00:03:55.000> things<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.300> was<00:03:55.390> doing

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
got into the swing of things I was doing

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.260 
got into the swing of things I was doing
okay<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:57.280> anyway<00:03:57.520> that's<00:03:57.580> totally<00:03:58.030> beside

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
okay but anyway that's totally beside

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.720 
okay but anyway that's totally beside
the<00:03:58.450> point<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.770> new<00:03:59.920> exciting<00:04:00.310> thing<00:04:00.580> now

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
the point so the new exciting thing now

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.310 
the point so the new exciting thing now
that<00:04:00.760> means<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.239> build<00:04:01.480> 32<00:04:01.780> we're<00:04:02.110> gonna<00:04:02.200> be

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
that means is build 32 we're gonna be

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.780 
that means is build 32 we're gonna be
looking<00:04:02.440> forward<00:04:02.860> for<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.070> next<00:04:03.100> few<00:04:03.520> weeks

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
looking forward for the next few weeks

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.250 
looking forward for the next few weeks
hopefully<00:04:04.209> we'll<00:04:04.600> start<00:04:04.810> seeing<00:04:05.020> some

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
hopefully we'll start seeing some

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.320 
hopefully we'll start seeing some
trickling<00:04:05.590> information<00:04:06.070> on<00:04:06.160> build<00:04:06.370> 32<00:04:06.670> what's

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
trickling information on build 32 what's

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.180 
trickling information on build 32 what's
coming<00:04:07.660> in<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.840> build<00:04:08.020> 32<00:04:08.320> my<00:04:08.950> guess<00:04:09.160> is

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
coming in to build 32 my guess is

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.800 
coming in to build 32 my guess is
animation<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:09.940> stealth<00:04:10.209> system<00:04:10.600> will<00:04:10.720> be

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
animation and stealth system will be

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.930 
animation and stealth system will be
seeing<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.140> build<00:04:11.260> 32<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.950> what<00:04:12.640> they<00:04:12.760> say

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
seeing and build 32 and what they say

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.610 
seeing and build 32 and what they say
here<00:04:13.330> is<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.480> there's<00:04:13.780> some<00:04:13.989> major<00:04:14.290> progress

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
here is that there's some major progress

here is that there's some major progress
that<00:04:14.950> has<00:04:15.040> happened<00:04:15.400> on<00:04:15.519> NPCs<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:16.480> they<00:04:16.570> don't

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
that has happened on NPCs but they don't

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.420

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
got to run it through some tests first

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.120

that I got terribly excited about

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.159 
that I got terribly excited about
because<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.270> just<00:04:57.389> didn't<00:04:57.690> care<00:04:57.840> that<00:04:57.900> much

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169
