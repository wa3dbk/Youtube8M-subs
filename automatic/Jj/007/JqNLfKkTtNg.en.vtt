traveling<00:03:07.510> back<00:03:07.690> here<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.530> case<00:03:08.739> it's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
traveling back here in this case it's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.410 
traveling back here in this case it's
clamped<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.580> front<00:03:09.730> pocket<00:03:10.209> for<00:03:10.390> a

clamped on to the front pocket for a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.560 
clamped on to the front pocket for a
quick<00:03:10.630> diagram<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.790> magic<00:03:13.150> about<00:03:13.300> this

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
quick diagram and the magic about this

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.390 
quick diagram and the magic about this
is<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.930> does<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.530> without<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.040> having<00:03:15.250> to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
is it does this without you having to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.699 
is it does this without you having to
take<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.790> pocket<00:03:16.239> off<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:17.260> no<00:03:17.440> sewing

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
take the pocket off so no sewing

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.410 
take the pocket off so no sewing
involved<00:03:18.190> just<00:03:18.370> putting<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.670> move<00:03:18.820> on<00:03:18.970> clamp<00:03:19.300> it

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
involved just putting a move on clamp it

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.180

operating now let's also talk about the
key<00:05:49.580> thing<00:05:49.850> that<00:05:50.330> brought<00:05:50.570> us<00:05:50.720> to<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.080> video

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
key thing that brought us to this video

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.830 
key thing that brought us to this video
which<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.680> Happy's<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.580> most<00:05:52.840> important

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
which is Happy's the most important

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.390 
which is Happy's the most important
updates<00:05:54.229> of<00:05:54.350> the<00:05:54.410> machine<00:05:54.710> which<00:05:54.979> is<00:05:55.190> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
updates of the machine which is the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.490 
updates of the machine which is the
touchscreen<00:05:55.940> control<00:05:56.479> panel<00:05:56.840> the

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
touchscreen control panel the

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.710 
touchscreen control panel the
touchscreen<00:05:57.860> control<00:05:58.310> panel<00:05:58.669> allows<00:05:58.880> a<00:05:59.120> much

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
touchscreen control panel allows a much

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.750 
touchscreen control panel allows a much
greater<00:06:00.050> use<00:06:00.440> of<00:06:00.470> operation<00:06:01.280> in<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.460> machine

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
greater use of operation in the machine

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.840 
greater use of operation in the machine
simply<00:06:02.539> by<00:06:02.949> instead<00:06:03.949> of<00:06:04.130> having<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.669> lot<00:06:04.820> of

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
simply by instead of having a lot of

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.490 
simply by instead of having a lot of
buttons<00:06:05.240> at<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.449> bottom<00:06:05.810> we<00:06:06.199> can<00:06:06.320> basically

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
buttons at the bottom we can basically

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.740 
buttons at the bottom we can basically
touch<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.220> screen<00:06:07.550> wherever<00:06:07.970> we<00:06:08.539> see

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
touch the screen wherever we see

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.500 
touch the screen wherever we see

projects done also finally on the side
of<00:06:42.020> the<00:06:42.080> machine<00:06:42.410> here<00:06:42.440> is<00:06:43.280> a<00:06:43.310> bobbin<00:06:43.729> winder

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
of the machine here is a bobbin winder

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.450 
of the machine here is a bobbin winder
which<00:06:44.150> operates<00:06:44.599> independently<00:06:45.260> of<00:06:45.349> the<00:06:45.590> of

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
which operates independently of the of

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.250 
which operates independently of the of
the<00:06:46.760> main<00:06:46.970> motor<00:06:47.210> so<00:06:47.539> that<00:06:47.690> the<00:06:47.780> machine<00:06:48.080> can

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
the main motor so that the machine can

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.469 
the main motor so that the machine can
actually<00:06:48.680> be<00:06:49.220> sewing<00:06:49.610> on<00:06:49.729> a<00:06:49.760> project<00:06:50.300> while

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
actually be sewing on a project while

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.700 
actually be sewing on a project while
you're<00:06:50.630> setting<00:06:50.900> up<00:06:50.990> the<00:06:51.110> next<00:06:51.289> one<00:06:51.440> at<00:06:51.590> the
