now<00:00:00.179> we<00:00:00.240> don't<00:00:00.329> wanna<00:00:00.510> make<00:00:00.630> any<00:00:00.829> assumptions

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:01.850 
now we don't wanna make any assumptions

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.059 
now we don't wanna make any assumptions
so<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.000> saying<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.049> likely<00:00:04.500> but<00:00:04.680> you

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
so we're saying this is likely but you

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.320 
so we're saying this is likely but you
know<00:00:05.190> we'll<00:00:05.370> start<00:00:05.640> with<00:00:05.759> Google<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
know we'll start with Google in the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.660 
know we'll start with Google in the
Nexus<00:00:06.660> 6<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.020> 9<00:00:07.170> that's<00:00:07.560> right<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:07.950> Google's

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
Nexus 6 and 9 that's right so Google's

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.459 
Nexus 6 and 9 that's right so Google's
Nexus<00:00:08.790> live<00:00:09.450> extra<00:00:09.750> has<00:00:09.870> been<00:00:10.019> very<00:00:10.290> well

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
Nexus live extra has been very well

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.749 
Nexus live extra has been very well
received<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:11.040> actually<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> things

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
received it's actually one of the things

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.820 
received it's actually one of the things
that<00:00:11.849> Google<00:00:12.599> has<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.110> order<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> set<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> bar

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that Google has in order to set the bar

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
that Google has in order to set the bar
for<00:00:13.860> everybody<00:00:14.340> else<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> what<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.480> to

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
for everybody else and what you have to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.210 
for everybody else and what you have to
realize<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.170> across<00:00:16.710> all<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> these

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
realize is that across all of these

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.590 
realize is that across all of these
platforms<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:18.000> you're<00:00:18.150> seeing<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
platforms what you're seeing is that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.260 
platforms what you're seeing is that
software<00:00:19.289> has<00:00:19.529> become<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.460> operating<00:00:20.939> system

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
software has become the operating system

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.480 
software has become the operating system
through<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> cloud<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.800> imagine<00:00:22.980> 10

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
through the cloud so if you imagine 10

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
through the cloud so if you imagine 10
years<00:00:23.699> ago<00:00:23.850> we're<00:00:24.570> buying<00:00:24.810> hardware<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
years ago we're buying hardware at the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.769 
years ago we're buying hardware at the
prices<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.460> software<00:00:27.000> 10<00:00:27.180> years<00:00:27.359> ago<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
prices of software 10 years ago and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.230 
prices of software 10 years ago and
without<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.500> complete<00:00:29.160> set<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> offerings<00:00:29.849> no

without a complete set of offerings no

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
without a complete set of offerings no
platform<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.990> complete<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.099> like

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
platform is complete because it's like

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.709 
platform is complete because it's like
having<00:00:32.520> parts<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.210> your<00:00:33.300> software<00:00:33.660> an

having parts of your software an
operating<00:00:34.020> system<00:00:34.050> missing<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.860> I'd<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
operating system missing now I'd like to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.650 
operating system missing now I'd like to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it is it fair I mean are these guys not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
it is it fair I mean are these guys not
getting<00:00:44.160> enough<00:00:44.280> attention<00:00:44.340> yeah<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
getting enough attention yeah I think I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
getting enough attention yeah I think I
think<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.870> fair<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.590> they're<00:00:46.710> not

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
think it is fair I think they're not

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
think it is fair I think they're not
providing<00:00:47.190> enough<00:00:47.370> value<00:00:47.820> proposition<00:00:48.690> for

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
providing enough value proposition for

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
providing enough value proposition for
the<00:00:48.930> consumer<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.890> moto<00:00:50.129> x's<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.610> actually

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the consumer so so moto x's is actually

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.160 
the consumer so so moto x's is actually
a<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.180> good<00:00:51.270> phone<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a pretty good phone I've actually the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.420 
a pretty good phone I've actually the
first<00:00:52.320> generation<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.039> actually<00:00:53.280> really

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
first generation it's actually really

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
first generation it's actually really
nicely<00:00:53.670> done<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.420> pioneers<00:00:55.020> certain<00:00:55.379> things

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
nicely done it pioneers certain things

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
nicely done it pioneers certain things
like<00:00:56.070> always<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.699> voice<00:00:57.030> command<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
like always on voice command but that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.029 
like always on voice command but that
just<00:00:57.930> isn't<00:00:58.199> enough<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.680> actually<00:00:58.770> set

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
just isn't enough to actually set

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
just isn't enough to actually set
themselves<00:00:59.219> apart<00:00:59.460> same<00:01:00.390> thing<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> fire

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
themselves apart same thing with a fire

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.229 
themselves apart same thing with a fire
phone<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.590> great<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.850> snap<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
phone it's great that I can go snap a

phone it's great that I can go snap a
photo<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.600> something<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> maybe<00:01:04.170> amazon<00:01:04.860> can

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
photo of something and maybe amazon can

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
photo of something and maybe amazon can
ship<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.430> house<00:01:05.549> immediately<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.360> how

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
often do i do you really need to do that
amazon<00:01:08.460> also<00:01:08.610> came<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> chromecast<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
amazon also came out with a chromecast a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
amazon also came out with a chromecast a
google<00:01:10.500> chromecast<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.220> TV<00:01:11.760> stick<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
google chromecast like TV stick this is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.240 
google chromecast like TV stick this is
something<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> plug<00:01:13.380> into<00:01:13.680> your

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
something that you plug into your

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
something that you plug into your
television<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.270> you've<00:01:15.900> already

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
television that's right you've already

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
television that's right you've already
bought<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.159> haven't<00:01:17.400> gotten

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
bought that as well you haven't gotten

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270 
bought that as well you haven't gotten
it<00:01:17.850> yet<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:19.380> walking<00:01:19.860> down<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it yet but are they walking down the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
it yet but are they walking down the
same<00:01:20.460> path<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.119> potentially<00:01:21.630> IRA<00:01:21.780> could

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
same path here potentially IRA could

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.530 
same path here potentially IRA could
this<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.189> had<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> fire<00:01:24.000> phone<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.420> have

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
this be so you had a fire phone you have

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
this be so you had a fire phone you have
to<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.840> Amazon<00:01:25.380> Google<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> Apple

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to think about Amazon Google and Apple

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
to think about Amazon Google and Apple
as<00:01:26.340> three<00:01:26.580> companies<00:01:26.850> competing<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
as three companies competing for the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
as three companies competing for the
same<00:01:28.140> thing<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.250> operating<00:01:29.700> system

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
same thing which is the operating system

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
same thing which is the operating system
of<00:01:30.270> everyday<00:01:30.509> life<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:31.740> about

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
of everyday life and if you think about

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
of everyday life and if you think about
it<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.070> way<00:01:32.340> amazon<00:01:33.030> can't<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.229> this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it that way amazon can't not have this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
it that way amazon can't not have this
because<00:01:34.860> people<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> watch<00:01:35.579> content<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
because people want to watch content of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.460 
because people want to watch content of
their<00:01:36.180> television<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.079> amazon<00:01:37.439> prime

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
their television they have amazon prime

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.140 
their television they have amazon prime
which<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.009> our<00:01:38.130> on-demand<00:01:38.430> video<00:01:38.670> service

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
which is our on-demand video service

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
which is our on-demand video service
this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.659> complementary<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> them<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:41.009> isn't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this is complementary to them this isn't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
this is complementary to them this isn't
a<00:01:41.460> stand-alone<00:01:41.880> line<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.299> product<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
a stand-alone line of product and if you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.999 
a stand-alone line of product and if you
think<00:01:43.049> about<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.860> doesn't

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
think about it that way then it doesn't

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
think about it that way then it doesn't
make<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> lot<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.460> sense<00:01:44.520> okay<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.899> chromecast

do<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.409> who<00:02:58.409> knows<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.760> it

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
do that who knows can I will do it

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.580 
do that who knows can I will do it
better<00:03:00.090> well<00:03:00.599> apples<00:03:00.959> gonna<00:03:01.140> continue<00:03:01.530> to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
better well apples gonna continue to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.960 
better well apples gonna continue to
make<00:03:01.709> better<00:03:01.829> money<00:03:02.040> because<00:03:02.489> they<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.940> a

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
make better money because they have a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
make better money because they have a
very<00:03:03.239> different<00:03:03.480> philosophy<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.230> Google<00:03:04.530> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
very different philosophy so Google is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.890 
very different philosophy so Google is
saying<00:03:04.890> let's<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.549> hardware<00:03:06.180> commodity<00:03:06.720> and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
saying let's make hardware commodity and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.780 
saying let's make hardware commodity and
will<00:03:07.109> sell<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.379> software<00:03:07.859> as<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> service<00:03:08.400> what

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
will sell you software as a service what

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
will sell you software as a service what
Apple<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.090> saying<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.510> will<00:03:09.840> sell<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.079> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
Apple is saying is will sell you the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.839 
Apple is saying is will sell you the
software<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.769> free<00:03:10.799> everybody<00:03:11.579> gets<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
software for free everybody gets the

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.149 
software for free everybody gets the
same<00:03:11.879> upgrade<00:03:12.299> for<00:03:12.540> free<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.230> life<00:03:13.470> including

same upgrade for free for life including
all<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.370> their<00:03:14.519> productivity<00:03:15.359> software<00:03:15.659> but

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
all of their productivity software but

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.569 
all of their productivity software but
will<00:03:16.470> sell<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.889> hardware<00:03:17.250> because<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
will sell you the hardware because the

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.520 
will sell you the hardware because the
margins<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.000> aren't<00:03:18.269> hardware<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.810> Apple

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
margins that aren't hardware and Apple

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.020 
margins that aren't hardware and Apple
can<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.190> apples<00:03:20.639> figured<00:03:20.910> out

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
can do that because apples figured out

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.490 
can do that because apples figured out
how<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.389> make<00:03:21.599> better<00:03:21.750> margin<00:03:22.139> hardware

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
how to make better margin hardware

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.379 
how to make better margin hardware
where's<00:03:22.739> everybody<00:03:23.040> else<00:03:23.130> hasn't<00:03:23.459> now<00:03:24.180> let's

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
where's everybody else hasn't now let's

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.210 
where's everybody else hasn't now let's
talk<00:03:24.510> about<00:03:24.569> market<00:03:25.349> share<00:03:25.560> versus<00:03:25.950> mind

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
talk about market share versus mind

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.390 
talk about market share versus mind
share<00:03:26.549> because<00:03:27.230> Android<00:03:28.230> has<00:03:28.500> most<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
share because Android has most of the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.159 
share because Android has most of the
market<00:03:29.730> share<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.239> seems<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.569> Apple<00:03:31.139> has

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
market share but it seems that Apple has

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.159 
market share but it seems that Apple has
most<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.549> mind<00:03:32.849> share<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> fair

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
most of the mind share is that a fair

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.960 
most of the mind share is that a fair
assessment<00:03:34.379> why<00:03:34.980> why<00:03:35.400> would<00:03:35.669> that<00:03:35.790> be

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
assessment why why would that be

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.430 
assessment why why would that be
happening<00:03:36.419> if<00:03:36.510> there<00:03:36.690> are<00:03:36.840> all<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.109> these

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
happening if there are all of these

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080 
happening if there are all of these
people<00:03:37.650> out<00:03:38.099> there<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.400> are<00:03:38.459> using<00:03:38.790> Android
