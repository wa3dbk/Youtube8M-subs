hello and welcome to the TARDIS console
so<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> build<00:00:06.960> that's<00:00:07.109> been<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.980> on

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
so this is a build that's been going on

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.250 
so this is a build that's been going on
for<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> little<00:00:08.670> while<00:00:08.910> now<00:00:09.150> actually<00:00:09.900> about

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
for a little while now actually about

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.820 
for a little while now actually about
three<00:00:10.559> months<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.630> it's<00:00:12.630> been<00:00:12.750> updated<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.799> few

three months and it's been updated a few
times<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.490> TARDIS<00:00:15.000> builders<00:00:15.710> but<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.740> thought

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
times on TARDIS builders but I thought

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.939 
times on TARDIS builders but I thought
I'd<00:00:17.130> give<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.460> look<00:00:17.789> round<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> camera

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
I'd give you a look round on the camera

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.679

just<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.130> show<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.699> more<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.330> depth

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
just to show you a bit more in depth

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.160 
just to show you a bit more in depth
about<00:00:21.990> what's<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.760> how<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.630> made

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

so yeah so this is the console at the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.160 
so yeah so this is the console at the
moment<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.220> probably<00:00:30.179> about<00:00:30.240> I'd<00:00:30.510> say<00:00:30.539> 60%

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
moment it's probably about I'd say 60%

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.470 
moment it's probably about I'd say 60%
done<00:00:32.719> yes<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.170> got<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.590> newly<00:00:34.950> installed

friend Tom I've tried my best to keep
the<00:01:16.740> console<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.930> close<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.110> possible<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the console as close as possible as I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.670 
the console as close as possible as I
can<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.460> making<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.630> getting<00:01:21.900> parts<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.409> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
as you can see there are a few part bits

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.070 
as you can see there are a few part bits
and<00:01:26.880> pieces<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> you'll<00:01:27.689> recognise

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

and pieces on here that you'll recognise
so<00:01:28.380> these<00:01:29.240> pumps<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> vortex<00:01:31.079> loops

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
so these pumps here the vortex loops

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
so these pumps here the vortex loops
they're<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.920> those

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.990 
of a piece of perspex to give you the
effect<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.010> I've<00:02:29.190> got<00:02:29.340> something<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.760> score

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
effect so I've got something to score

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.110 
effect so I've got something to score
into<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:33.860> that's<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.310> one<00:02:35.519> panels<00:02:35.970> that's

into so that's this is one panels that's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.360 
into so that's this is one panels that's
ongoing<00:02:36.299> there's<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.900> CRT<00:02:37.440> yoke<00:02:37.890> made<00:02:38.129> from<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
ongoing there's a CRT yoke made from a

piece of MDF and fitting from some

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.620 
piece of MDF and fitting from some
garden<00:02:46.319> equipment<00:02:46.549> here<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.000> main<00:02:48.180> d-mat

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
garden equipment here is the main d-mat

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.670

getting fixed up there's a sextant which

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.160 
getting fixed up there's a sextant which
was<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> little<00:03:33.329> bit<00:03:33.450> smaller<00:03:33.720> work<00:03:33.989> than

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
was a little bit smaller work than

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.289 
was a little bit smaller work than
expected<00:03:34.650> when<00:03:34.829> I<00:03:34.859> bought<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.760> quite

then<00:04:52.810> some<00:04:53.500> I've<00:04:53.680> used<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:54.040> sharpie<00:04:54.520> to

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
then some I've used a sharpie to

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.080 
then some I've used a sharpie to
draw<00:04:55.540> on<00:04:55.660> top<00:04:55.960> of<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.260> there's<00:04:56.890> lots<00:04:57.100> of<00:04:57.340> motors

tardis flicky switches this is one of

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.860 
tardis flicky switches this is one of
the<00:05:17.440> original<00:05:17.770> parts<00:05:18.130> from<00:05:18.730> very<00:05:19.600> first

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
the original parts from very first

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.900 
the original parts from very first
console<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.500> probably<00:05:20.710> made<00:05:21.750> these<00:05:22.750> here

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
console I probably made these here

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.170 
console I probably made these here
crystals<00:05:25.380> as<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.590> can<00:05:26.680> see<00:05:27.180> they're

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
crystals as you can see they're

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.480

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
screwballs

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.250 
screwballs
so<00:05:30.490> which<00:05:30.730> I<00:05:30.850> thought<00:05:31.060> was<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.300> best<00:05:31.330> way<00:05:32.110> in

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
so which I thought was the best way in

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.870 
so which I thought was the best way in
which<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.710> be<00:05:33.340> able<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.640> make<00:05:34.230> thing<00:05:35.760> she<00:05:36.760> has

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
which to be able to make thing she has

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.940 
which to be able to make thing she has
lots<00:05:37.150> of<00:05:37.390> people<00:05:38.050> it's<00:05:38.170> and<00:05:38.380> pieces<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:38.770> are

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
lots of people it's and pieces that are

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.540 
lots of people it's and pieces that are
being<00:05:39.340> wired<00:05:39.940> up<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.510> done<00:05:41.470> has<00:05:41.860> lots<00:05:42.370> of

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
being wired up and done has lots of

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.300 
being wired up and done has lots of
piping<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.330> hangs<00:05:43.570> from<00:05:43.750> ceiling<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.680> have

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
piping the hangs from ceiling and I have

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.830 
piping the hangs from ceiling and I have
here<00:05:45.490> just<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.790> give<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.090> visual<00:05:46.570> effect

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
here just to give you the visual effect

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.150 
here just to give you the visual effect
of<00:05:47.110> hanging<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:48.490> console<00:05:48.910> screen<00:05:49.350> does<00:05:50.350> move

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
of hanging the console screen does move

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.310 
of hanging the console screen does move
around<00:05:51.370> although<00:05:51.910> at<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:52.900> moment<00:05:53.230> is

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
around although at the moment is

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.810 
around although at the moment is
slightly<00:05:53.620> weighted<00:05:54.130> which<00:05:54.280> is<00:05:54.430> pulling<00:05:54.730> the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
slightly weighted which is pulling the

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.630 
slightly weighted which is pulling the
rotor<00:05:55.360> itself<00:05:56.080> down<00:05:56.590> so<00:05:56.890> I've<00:05:57.010> got<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.400> put

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
rotor itself down so I've got to put

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.360 
rotor itself down so I've got to put
some<00:05:57.669> weights<00:05:58.000> on<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.270> back<00:05:58.419> of<00:05:58.600> that<00:05:59.370> down

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
some weights on the back of that down

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.300 
some weights on the back of that down
here<00:06:00.640> is<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:02.080> pyrene<00:06:02.500> fire<00:06:02.740> extinguisher

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
here is the pyrene fire extinguisher

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.700 
here is the pyrene fire extinguisher
which<00:06:03.520> I'm<00:06:03.850> still<00:06:04.120> planning<00:06:04.419> to<00:06:04.570> get<00:06:04.900> mounted

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
which I'm still planning to get mounted

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.650 
which I'm still planning to get mounted
on<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.980> bottom<00:06:06.130> of<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.430> these<00:06:07.090> buttresses

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
on the bottom of the these buttresses

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.230 
on the bottom of the these buttresses
these<00:06:08.020> two<00:06:08.290> still<00:06:08.620> need<00:06:09.310> finishing<00:06:09.850> off<00:06:09.970> as

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
these two still need finishing off as

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.940 
these two still need finishing off as
you<00:06:10.450> can<00:06:10.570> see<00:06:10.690> these<00:06:10.810> are<00:06:10.960> chicken<00:06:11.110> wire<00:06:11.410> these

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
you can see these are chicken wire these

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.409 
you can see these are chicken wire these
are<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.220> two<00:06:12.370> experimental<00:06:12.940> ones<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.360> I

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
are the two experimental ones that I

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.210 
are the two experimental ones that I
done<00:06:13.600> at<00:06:13.690> the<00:06:13.780> start<00:06:14.020> until<00:06:14.410> I<00:06:14.530> decided<00:06:14.980> to

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
done at the start until I decided to

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.159 
done at the start until I decided to
finish<00:06:15.490> him<00:06:15.610> off<00:06:15.700> with<00:06:15.880> cardboard<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:16.630> the

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
finish him off with cardboard and the

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.900 
finish him off with cardboard and the
cardboard<00:06:17.760> actually<00:06:18.760> gives<00:06:19.110> quite<00:06:20.110> a<00:06:20.169> good

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
cardboard actually gives quite a good

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.470 
cardboard actually gives quite a good
strength<00:06:21.910> with<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:23.440> mod<00:06:23.620> rock<00:06:23.830> on<00:06:23.980> top

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
strength with the mod rock on top

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.640 
strength with the mod rock on top
there's<00:06:25.480> some<00:06:25.600> pipe<00:06:25.810> insulation<00:06:26.230> which<00:06:26.500> is

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
there's some pipe insulation which is

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.530 
there's some pipe insulation which is
going<00:06:26.800> to<00:06:26.890> be<00:06:27.040> sitting<00:06:27.190> under<00:06:27.400> here<00:06:27.700> and<00:06:27.910> leave

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
going to be sitting under here and leave

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.220 
going to be sitting under here and leave
the<00:06:28.660> main<00:06:28.840> panel<00:06:29.230> and<00:06:30.540> there's<00:06:31.540> some<00:06:31.720> perspex

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
the main panel and there's some perspex

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.420 
the main panel and there's some perspex
there<00:06:32.500> which<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.800> going<00:06:33.040> to<00:06:33.100> be<00:06:33.190> able<00:06:33.310> to

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
there which is going to be able to

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.350 
there which is going to be able to
finish<00:06:33.640> off<00:06:33.880> what's<00:06:34.390> needed<00:06:36.000> so<00:06:37.000> yeah<00:06:37.120> there's

as the bench seat here which will be

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.750 
as the bench seat here which will be
finished<00:06:43.350> off<00:06:43.530> it's<00:06:44.100> got<00:06:44.250> to<00:06:44.310> get<00:06:44.370> some<00:06:44.580> fabric

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
finished off it's got to get some fabric

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.840 
finished off it's got to get some fabric
for<00:06:45.150> that<00:06:45.680> that's<00:06:46.680> just<00:06:46.890> made<00:06:47.070> from<00:06:47.280> three<00:06:47.730> old
