 previous 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.779
 something that was followed to the letter 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.300
 the focus of the combat and the use of the character's points 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.789
 controlled by control articles 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:20.089

 aiming at several times 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.209
 investigations were also given greater 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.340
 and it seems more complex than investigating and cataloging evidence 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.810
 you will have several questions to ask and that will be decisive in the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.699
 case 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.940
 if everything is done correctly 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.889
 good year will be made available to be exchanged for improvements 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.919
 as a larger energy bars for example 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:16.119
 even though the script that the final hours is in charge of decreasing the climate of 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.420
 fervor and solitude 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.389
 generally 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.729
 with a lieutenant an artist brunch is presented in an exceptional manner 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.749
 even in very dark scenarios there is a great detailing of objects and 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:27.659
 textures 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.319
 with an art direction that seems to follow a style of films like seven or 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.480
 fight Club 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.610
 with a lot of rain 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.100
 this blood coagulated the dubbing and the sound effects are also very well 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.150
 architects and contributes to many scares especially if you know of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.430
 Someone on is good and I hope we lose. 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:54.099
 even with the skidded in the plot with a good variety in low light you still 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.660
 will be able to take some good scares 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.050
 I saw everything run without major technical problems other than occasional falls 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.680
 in the frame rates or for some show of them in inopportune moments 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:10.709
 as a follow-up to the main campaign to sleep river mode to fight 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.529

 possible during constant attack 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.549
 and which civilians where a group of players would quickly investigate the 

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:39.890
 whereabouts of a box 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.979
 answered by the opposing team 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.029
 who can be moved during matches 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:50.199
 with dismissed artist works tries to fix defects of the original game that extend the 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.719
 characteristics that have made him a considerable success 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.520
 almost three years ago 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.840
 who gets virtually all of this with a fighter-oriented combat system 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.280
 a well-developed melee and a more 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.120
 deep the gloomy and scary climate still continues 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.250
 who much is due throughout the plot 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.030
 and start to grow too big to try to close the circle by disappointing a little 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.080
 in the end 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.839
 it is still a consistent title 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.529
 do not lose more because you do not have really proposed options to extend your 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.529
 life after the end of the main campaign 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.439
