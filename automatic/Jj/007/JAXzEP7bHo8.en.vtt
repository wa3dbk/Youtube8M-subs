00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
though we can be frustrating at times

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.430 
though we can be frustrating at times
it's<00:02:31.510> best<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.140> always<00:02:34.019> take<00:02:35.019> your<00:02:35.230> time

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.330 

of<00:02:46.050> course<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.590> only<00:02:46.620> want<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.130> hair<00:02:47.310> to

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.840 

and<00:03:16.170> then<00:03:16.350> that's<00:03:16.470> basically<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.370> do

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.670 

you<00:03:23.420> want<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.690> braid<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.260> tip<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.950> that

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
you want to braid it to the tip so that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:41.210 
you want to braid it to the tip so that
it<00:03:27.680> won't<00:03:27.860> come<00:03:28.160> loose

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.940 

like<00:03:41.820> that

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.680 

then<00:03:48.520> you're<00:03:48.640> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.819> add<00:03:48.879> this<00:03:49.209> part<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
then you're going to add this part and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.410 
then you're going to add this part and
you're<00:03:49.750> going<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.959> cross<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.410> over<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:52.239> this

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
you're going to cross it over to this

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:23.530 
you're going to cross it over to this
side<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:56.050> you're<00:03:56.260> going<00:03:56.349> to<00:03:56.440> use<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> bobby<00:03:56.890> pin

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.480 

you<00:04:24.170> can<00:04:24.290> do<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.560> same<00:04:24.590> thing<00:04:25.100> for<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.400> other

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
you can do the same thing for the other

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.970 
you can do the same thing for the other
side<00:04:26.230> so<00:04:27.230> you're<00:04:27.350> going<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.500> take<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.680> room

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
then off of this one the represents that

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.010 
then off of this one the represents that
