00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
is the full arrest technology now this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
is the full arrest technology now this
is<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.940> decelerator<00:02:31.940> pack<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:33.020> is

going to reduce the force of a fall by

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.070 
going to reduce the force of a fall by
fifty<00:02:37.160> percent<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.330> fall<00:02:38.750> out<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.050> tree

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
fifty percent so you fall out of a tree

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.120 
fifty percent so you fall out of a tree
you're<00:02:39.710> going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.600> experience<00:02:41.600> an<00:02:42.050> impact<00:02:42.860> of
