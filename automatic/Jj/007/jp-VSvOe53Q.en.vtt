00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello desktop lovers 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:14.150
 Tennis with you Zhdanov Vasily and we will 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:19.100
 disassemble the combination edge gem against 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:22.529
 I am all about food for whom this is a team meeting 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.180
 Japan vs Greece in the championship 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.180
 peace in tokyo 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.070
 we will disassemble the combination to the ring 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:49.670
 against the Japanese so here if anyone 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 scoring is presented at our top 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:06.500
 Essenes of food whom conditionally submitted to the bottom 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:06.500
 and so kringle 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:21.890
 serves both left and left 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.890
 short feed to the center under the net 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.259
 everything 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:40.040
 with a little appeal to the court throughout 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:43.460
 throws the ball at a sharp angle with a sharp 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.460
 under the net 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:02:00.159
 Kolny braid and ball when it falls at the table 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:01.799
 Klingon produces topspin here 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.219
 actually such a combination 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:11.430
 quite simple but often korean ga 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:16.110
 on it won the snag player experienced 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.230
 player stable great game experience 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:37.120
 let's see this combination on 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:38.910
 records as we saw kringle feeds under 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.810
 mesh 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.329
 This is shorter than the ball under the net 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.079
 and when the ball and 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:53.950
 falls off the table rank does 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:56.590
 diagonal top is such a combination 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.130
 let 's look in the game when it is not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.130
 used look 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:19.849
 as we see the same short 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:24.730
 closer right zone japanese japanese 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.950
 speaks diagonally and to the ring attacks 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.469
 Only by the skin we look diagonally 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.469
 this combination of another token 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.970
 diagonal suspension toy 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.120
 come back again short serve 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:58.620
 your diagonal is central and 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:03.660
 either closer to the right side under the grid 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:14.310
 short feed why short not to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:15.660
 was attack click left click click this 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.840
 topspin twist 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.240
 from the table if coriander sold here 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.720
 this zone of lab danger of attack 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.820
 twisted off the table 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.430
 so how twist happy island deal 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.550
 harder so karinka gives closer to 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:40.040
 the right side is quieter someone knocks on 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.040
 diagonally since the ring is far away 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.810
 far to make him stretch one 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.290
 less time and when the ball 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.990
 falls 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:58.140
 starts yelling diagonally here 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:07.160
 actually such a combination was a bow 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:07.160
 the ring, he snatched this batch with a score of 3 0 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.740
 thank you for coming to you was the most 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.890
 Basil, wait for the next analysis 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.000

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.960
 table tennis 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.960
