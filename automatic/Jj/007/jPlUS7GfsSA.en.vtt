00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
though is some guys did want timing

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.610 
though is some guys did want timing

able<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.539> control<00:01:04.780> their<00:01:04.930> ignition<00:01:05.320> timing

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
able to control their ignition timing

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.529 
able to control their ignition timing
and<00:01:05.800> that's<00:01:06.340> where<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.550> came<00:01:06.729> out<00:01:06.910> with<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.119> p3

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
and that's where we came out with the p3

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.139 
and that's where we came out with the p3
plus<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.440> basically<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.070> POW<00:01:09.340> ejection<00:01:09.850> 3

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
plus it's basically a POW ejection 3

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.080 
plus it's basically a POW ejection 3
with<00:01:10.960> additional<00:01:11.649> spark<00:01:11.950> control<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:12.820> this<00:01:12.970> is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
with additional spark control so this is

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
with additional spark control so this is
all<00:01:13.300> one<00:01:13.600> unit<00:01:13.960> all<00:01:14.140> one<00:01:14.619> unit<00:01:15.009> we've<00:01:15.340> got<00:01:15.550> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
all one unit all one unit we've got a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.749 
all one unit all one unit we've got a
ignition<00:01:17.259> system<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.679> go<00:01:17.770> along<00:01:18.009> with<00:01:18.039> it<00:01:18.250> it's

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
ignition system to go along with it it's

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.460 
ignition system to go along with it it's
a<00:01:18.940> two<00:01:19.300> wire<00:01:19.479> distributor<00:01:20.080> but<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.289> could<00:01:20.410> be

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
a two wire distributor but it could be

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.820 
a two wire distributor but it could be
used<00:01:20.619> with<00:01:20.770> any<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.700> standard<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:23.649> wire

what<00:01:25.990> kind<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.229> power<00:01:26.410> increases<00:01:27.069> can<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.340> see

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
what kind of power increases can we see

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.490 
what kind of power increases can we see
out<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.910> unit<00:01:28.179> like<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:28.360> what<00:01:29.200> I'd<00:01:29.319> like<00:01:29.440> to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
out of a unit like this what I'd like to

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.520 
out of a unit like this what I'd like to
say<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.979> um<00:01:30.190> timing<00:01:30.819> is<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.030> great<00:01:31.390> tool<00:01:31.810> for<00:01:32.140> gas

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
say is um timing is a great tool for gas

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.130 
say is um timing is a great tool for gas
mileage<00:01:33.039> a<00:01:33.250> guy<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.880> increase<00:01:34.390> his<00:01:34.539> timing

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
mileage a guy can increase his timing

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.839 
mileage a guy can increase his timing
while<00:01:35.590> he's<00:01:35.739> driving<00:01:35.830> down<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.280> road<00:01:36.310> you

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
while he's driving down the road you

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.279 
while he's driving down the road you
know<00:01:36.880> not<00:01:37.060> necessarily<00:01:37.239> under<00:01:37.840> wide<00:01:37.989> open

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
know not necessarily under wide open

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.779 
know not necessarily under wide open
throttle<00:01:38.440> but<00:01:38.739> while<00:01:39.220> he's<00:01:39.340> driving<00:01:39.429> on<00:01:39.729> the

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
throttle but while he's driving on the

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.460 
throttle but while he's driving on the
freeway<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.179> definitely<00:01:40.840> pick<00:01:41.080> up<00:01:41.200> some<00:01:41.319> more

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
freeway and definitely pick up some more

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.889 
freeway and definitely pick up some more
efficiency<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.520> obviously<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.209> reliability

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
efficiency and obviously the reliability

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.990 
efficiency and obviously the reliability
factor<00:01:44.080> comes<00:01:44.410> into<00:01:44.709> play<00:01:44.890> as<00:01:45.039> well<00:01:45.220> well<00:01:45.849> with

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
factor comes into play as well well with

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.820 
factor comes into play as well well with
the<00:01:46.119> FI<00:01:46.360> always<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.020> reliability<00:01:47.500> and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
the FI always have that reliability and
