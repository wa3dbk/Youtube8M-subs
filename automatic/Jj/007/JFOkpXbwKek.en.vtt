00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
number one is I slash which is 99 cents

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.890 
number one is I slash which is 99 cents
it<00:06:42.290> used<00:06:42.470> to<00:06:42.590> be<00:06:42.710> in<00:06:42.860> top<00:06:43.190> 25<00:06:43.639> but<00:06:43.940> now<00:06:44.120> I<00:06:44.419> just

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900

want to eliminate the amount that the

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:22.090 
want to eliminate the amount that the
green<00:07:17.000> bar<00:07:17.210> says<00:07:19.330> say<00:07:20.330> so<00:07:20.840> you<00:07:20.930> you<00:07:21.740> go<00:07:21.889> like

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
green bar says say so you you go like

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.790 
green bar says say so you you go like
this<00:07:22.310> but<00:07:22.610> if<00:07:22.729> you<00:07:22.880> cut<00:07:23.419> one<00:07:23.720> of<00:07:23.900> the<00:07:24.080> stars

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.640 
this but if you cut one of the stars
that<00:07:25.010> restarts<00:07:25.760> from<00:07:25.910> the<00:07:26.060> beginning<00:07:26.510> so<00:07:27.500> they

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
that restarts from the beginning so they

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.490 
that restarts from the beginning so they
all<00:07:27.800> have<00:07:27.950> to<00:07:28.039> be<00:07:28.070> on<00:07:28.310> one<00:07:28.520> side

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
all have to be on one side

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.970 
all have to be on one side
so<00:07:31.540> go<00:07:32.540> right<00:07:32.720> there<00:07:32.990> right<00:07:33.320> there<00:07:33.620> right

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:33.980 
so go right there right there right
