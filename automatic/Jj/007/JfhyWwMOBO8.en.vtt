00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.009
 have beautify the new ones on beautify 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.109
 night runs for 2015 for the spring and the 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.840
 posted summer and there was also one 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.150
 picture of a girl with beautiful 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.709
 black triangles on her nails mattia 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.330
 the geometric 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.400
 negative space forms such as it 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.320
 officially picked up by mrs coming 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.600
 all the way in and then actually got it 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.130
 quite a lot of questions how do you make that 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.680
 and then i thought you know what we make there 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.810
 just the same video from martin 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.880
 flap the most beautiful hands of our signs 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.320
 whoever he wants 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.850
 no you start with a number 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.040
 basic necessities I opted for 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.560
 a black nail polish and transparent 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.239
 nail polish and tape I would not have the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.530
 transparent because that comes in full 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.920
 tired off your nails so a bit of the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.079
 dull variant and scissors 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.210
 previously I have a thin layer 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.250
 transparent nail polish gained just 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.840
 to fix it all that shine then give 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.980
 it also gets better 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.510
 well then you actually cut ten small ones 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.670
 scraps of tape that you can fine 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.200
 table and paste because then you can do well 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.160
 at 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.170
 and then you actually go a kind 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.449
 stick diagonally on your nails 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.219
 you stick one from right to left 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.119
 up and one from bottom left to 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:09.219
 top right 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.170
 you actually do that with all nails and 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.490
 that is just a bit of british work but after some 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.079
 exercise you are always lucky 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.179
 more convenient 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.590
 well make sure it is well pressed push 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.719
 also check it with your fingers so that you 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.329
 don't get half triangles with too much 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.649
 wipe and then again and just too 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.259
 bit of black nail polish work 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.359
 colors the space in the meantime very nicely 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.979
 adhesive tapes and you actually do all of that 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.810
 nails and then you need it 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.119
 let it dry neatly because differently if you 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.859
 adds adhesive tapes subtracts then flows 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.409
 the nail it still expressed what i it 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.240
 becomes a very clean line 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.319
 yes and after you have done that and afterwards 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.849
 well dry 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.939
 you really have to wait until it is black 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.590
 is completely dry because you are different with 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.509
 transparent varnish it also smears 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.889
 and another completely dry when separated 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.039
 time with a transparent layer 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:56.770
 and then you come with these nice nails 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.739
 patrick and can hear them so i love 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.929
 you something else but I really had 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.729

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.989
 request of also own a tutorial of 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.140
 then I thought try then it was too 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.450
 read an article 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.319
 I also thought or not how it is now 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.480
 I know 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.069
 yes wheels but once you get it under 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.920
 have mastered all of it is really fat yeah 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.569
