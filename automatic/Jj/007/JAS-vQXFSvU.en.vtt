now I want the tips to be as even as

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.160 
now I want the tips to be as even as
possible<00:01:25.609> instead<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.509> putting<00:01:26.840> these<00:01:26.960> in<00:01:27.109> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
possible instead of putting these in a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.429 
possible instead of putting these in a
hair<00:01:27.350> stacker<00:01:27.649> I<00:01:27.799> just<00:01:28.130> manually<00:01:28.880> use<00:01:29.210> my<00:01:29.439> my

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
hair stacker I just manually use my my

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.969 
hair stacker I just manually use my my
fingers<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:34.189> I'm<00:01:34.399> gonna<00:01:34.549> tie<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:34.819> in<00:01:35.979> so

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
fingers and I'm gonna tie this in so

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.980 
fingers and I'm gonna tie this in so
that<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:38.530> fibers<00:01:39.759> face<00:01:40.840> backwards

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
that the fibers face backwards

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.770 
that the fibers face backwards
I<00:01:42.140> want<00:01:43.069> these<00:01:43.219> fibers<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:44.030> be<00:01:46.509> even<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:47.600> up

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
I want these fibers to be even this up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.809 
I want these fibers to be even this up
here<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.170> want<00:01:48.439> these<00:01:48.560> fibers<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.310> be<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
here I want these fibers to be the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.510 
here I want these fibers to be the
length<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.329> hook<00:01:50.740> plus<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:52.009> want<00:01:52.219> them<00:01:52.369> to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
length of the hook plus I want them to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.129 
length of the hook plus I want them to
hang<00:01:52.670> off<00:01:52.850> at<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.179> front<00:01:53.389> so<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.630> want<00:01:53.869> them<00:01:53.990> to

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
hang off at the front so I want them to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:59.649 
hang off at the front so I want them to
be<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.439> length<00:01:54.679> of<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.889> hook<00:01:55.899> plus<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:58.939> length

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
be the length of the hook plus a length

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.160 
be the length of the hook plus a length
to<00:02:00.049> hang<00:02:00.590> off<00:02:00.799> of<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.700> back<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.389> how<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.719> do<00:02:02.899> that

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
to hang off of the back so how I do that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.190 
to hang off of the back so how I do that
is<00:02:03.319> I<00:02:03.409> measure<00:02:03.679> it<00:02:03.770> by<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.009> tail<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.179> I<00:02:05.209> go<00:02:05.479> one

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
is I measure it by the tail so I go one

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.529 
is I measure it by the tail so I go one
length<00:02:06.439> because<00:02:06.859> that<00:02:07.009> tail<00:02:07.249> was<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:08.300> length

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
length because that tail was the length

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.620 
length because that tail was the length
of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> body<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.740> double<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.630> so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
of the body and then I double it so

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.050 
of the body and then I double it so
that's<00:02:11.810> gonna<00:02:11.959> be<00:02:12.050> where<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> tie<00:02:12.740> that<00:02:13.060> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
that's gonna be where I tie that that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.270 
that's gonna be where I tie that that
deer<00:02:14.360> hair<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:15.819> I'm<00:02:16.819> just<00:02:17.000> gonna<00:02:17.180> tie<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.450> in

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
deer hair in I'm just gonna tie it in

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.530 
deer hair in I'm just gonna tie it in
right<00:02:19.280> up<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.550> front<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:20.030> gonna<00:02:20.209> take<00:02:20.420> it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
right up at the front I'm gonna take it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.580 
right up at the front I'm gonna take it
backwards<00:02:20.750> all<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.040> way<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.790> tail<00:02:23.590> then

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
backwards all the way to the tail then

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.800 
backwards all the way to the tail then
I'm<00:02:24.650> gonna<00:02:24.799> cover<00:02:25.280> up<00:02:25.430> all<00:02:25.730> those<00:02:25.879> wraps

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
I'm gonna cover up all those wraps

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.210 
I'm gonna cover up all those wraps
I<00:02:27.220> can<00:02:28.220> trim<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.610> all<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.910> butt-ends<00:02:29.270> here

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
I can trim out all the butt-ends here

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.790 
I can trim out all the butt-ends here
I'm<00:02:31.220> gonna<00:02:31.340> cover<00:02:31.640> up<00:02:31.790> all<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:32.270> wraps<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.739> I

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
I'm gonna cover up all these wraps so I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.699 
I'm gonna cover up all these wraps so I
get<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> nice<00:02:34.190> clean<00:02:34.670> smooth<00:02:35.150> body<00:02:35.450> then<00:02:36.440> right
