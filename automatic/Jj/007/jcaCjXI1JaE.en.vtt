00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.390
 show how the hammer of rigor 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.650
 fireworks bridera wollongong so we go 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.650
 soon to 26 years 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.250
 m 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.000
 first went to 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.480
 in the west is fayez mans benchtop at the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 watch butter 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.360
 then we 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.360
 like your iphone 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.130
 no 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.470
 radio 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.680
 logically you too a fight against 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.680
 a dragon 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.690
 I'm fine 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.870
 now it's all soft there 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.710
 learns to smile 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.710
 What are we going to do 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.620
 maybe a little bit abused there I say well 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.620
 little 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.500
 it 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.880
 it's not with that 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.790
 is too far unfortunately 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.370
 so 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.240
 it annoys me what is the break 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.840
 it's his agreement 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.680
 so you go here then you have to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.670
 speak huh 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.640
 if I'm not mistaken by him to his will 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.850
 to be rather a tube 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.850
 here we are 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.420
 greece troll just 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.640
 to make the greece of tapping enough you have 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.640
 too much you will find everywhere 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.580
 and 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.580
 one day a framing you do not cheat 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.510
 if you have not done it already I hope 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.409
 for you we did not do the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.409
 walkers 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.430
 you have to cry sharif 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.470
 I have not seen the emotion of the whip m 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.340
 a heat to burst 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.340
 it's unbreathable 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.239
 always well sweat to fuck anything 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.450
 you have a better Basque 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.450
 the seats of the companions 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.650
 arriving to fight or let 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.920
 go down flap enter the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.920
 housing 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.930
 if you go to the very bottom you also have to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.970
 have a good experience like that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.180
 what you are going to have to find also at 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:42.280
 heart of die sheets bah what's there take the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:43.800
 heart then follows go you have a troll 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.570
 and return to see her 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.810
 I copy the video and we end up 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.000
 just after that one time you have 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.000
 composing your share of have you 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.749
 I will skip this to avoid spoiler 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:10.069
 was right after 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:14.319
 here's where we'll ask you 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.319
 to go to your cave 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.490
 that is to say we will fall 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.020
 your two measures 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.849
 fortunately 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.620
 apart from me you need the south so 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.650
 followed wanted 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.639
 finally all this is not very moral is 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.740
 good 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.510
 and we end up after this mission 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.950
 everything that tells you 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.470
 in his position see the hammer 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.720
 so yes so much for me to vary more 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.820
 quickly those who want to go faster 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.060

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.130

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.870
