00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
inches from that so you go one and one

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.700 
inches from that so you go one and one
and<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.690> half<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.140> then<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.350> draw<00:03:44.530> another

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
made so now you have the line and then

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000 
made so now you have the line and then
the<00:03:50.710> one<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.250> half<00:03:51.430> little<00:03:51.760> mark<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.600> is<00:03:52.810> a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
the one and a half little mark this is a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.430 
the one and a half little mark this is a
four<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.160> half<00:03:54.660> inches<00:03:55.660> up<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.110> then<00:03:56.260> this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
four and a half inches up and then this

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.400 
four and a half inches up and then this
is<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> one<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.550> a<00:03:57.670> half<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.810> from<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.200> last

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
is a one and a half so from the last

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.960 
is a one and a half so from the last
mark<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.580> made

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
you're gonna measure 6 inches so you go

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.060 
you're gonna measure 6 inches so you go
up<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.720> six<00:04:04.990> and<00:04:05.350> then<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.530> make<00:04:05.740> your<00:04:05.890> mark

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
gonna go again another one and a half

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.659 
gonna go again another one and a half
and<00:04:43.430> then<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.729> go<00:04:44.440> again<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.919> then<00:04:46.430> from<00:04:46.580> the

last mark go again
now<00:04:50.770> six<00:04:51.280> inches<00:04:51.670> not<00:04:51.850> seven

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.170

so now all you have to do is you take
your<00:05:03.240> ruler<00:05:03.629> and<00:05:03.659> you<00:05:04.139> roughly<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.979> put<00:05:05.400> it

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
your ruler and you roughly like put it

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.309 
your ruler and you roughly like put it
over<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:05.999> two<00:05:06.180> marks<00:05:06.449> and<00:05:06.599> finally<00:05:06.990> connect

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
over the two marks and finally connect

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.989 
over the two marks and finally connect
the<00:05:07.349> dots<00:05:08.839> so<00:05:09.839> just<00:05:10.379> put<00:05:10.559> it<00:05:10.650> over<00:05:10.800> at<00:05:11.189> the<00:05:11.430> four

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:11.999

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:18.080 
the dots so just put it over at the four
marks<00:05:12.499> and<00:05:13.499> then<00:05:14.210> straight<00:05:15.210> out

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.790 

the<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.540> half<00:05:19.720> words<00:05:19.960> are<00:05:20.410> knowing<00:05:20.680> these

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
the the half words are knowing these

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.760 
the the half words are knowing these
perfectly<00:05:21.370> on<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:22.060> line<00:05:22.240> but<00:05:23.170> if<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.590> just

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770
