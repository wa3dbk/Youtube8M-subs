video today on standing still at the
mounting<00:00:13.379> block<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.249> thought<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.789> would

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
mounting block so I thought this would

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.810 
mounting block so I thought this would
be<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.089> great<00:00:15.389> follow<00:00:15.719> up<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.470> our<00:00:17.010> video<00:00:17.400> last

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820

Friday on calming down hot horses
because<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> video<00:00:21.929> I<00:00:22.019> mentioned<00:00:22.260> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
because in the video I mentioned that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
because in the video I mentioned that
one<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.220> first<00:00:23.429> steps<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> want<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
one of the first steps if you want to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
one of the first steps if you want to
have<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.109> good<00:00:25.560> ride<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.429> make<00:00:26.550> sure<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
have a good ride is to make sure that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.669 
have a good ride is to make sure that
your<00:00:26.939> horse<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.359> quiet<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.170> standing<00:00:28.589> still

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
your horse is quiet and standing still

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.189 
your horse is quiet and standing still
at<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> mounting<00:00:29.189> block<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:31.019> some

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
at the mounting block and I got some

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.980 
at the mounting block and I got some
questions<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.919> you<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:33.000> exactly<00:00:33.180> how<00:00:33.810> do<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
questions on you know exactly how do we

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.760 
questions on you know exactly how do we
do<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.220> thought<00:00:35.490> today<00:00:35.789> it<00:00:35.910> would<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
do that so I thought today it would be a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.799 
do that so I thought today it would be a
great<00:00:37.770> place<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.460> through<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
great place to kind of go through that

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.340

they stand here as I kind of mess and
fidget<00:02:03.479> around<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.899> saddle<00:02:04.319> a<00:02:04.350> little

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
fidget around with my saddle a little

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.900

bit<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> hoping<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.759> he

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
bit and I was kind of hoping that he

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.630 
bit and I was kind of hoping that he
might<00:02:09.119> give<00:02:10.110> us<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.440> few<00:02:10.769> little<00:02:11.099> problems<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
might give us a few little problems to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.800 
might give us a few little problems to
work<00:02:11.760> through<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.239> looks<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.629> he's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
work through but it looks like he's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.080 
work through but it looks like he's
being<00:02:12.989> really<00:02:13.319> good<00:02:13.560> um<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.519> what<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> would<00:02:14.940> do

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
being really good um but what I would do

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.509
