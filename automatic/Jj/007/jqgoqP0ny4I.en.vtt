00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is a free tweak and it's actually called

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
is a free tweak and it's actually called
I<00:01:21.090> measure<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
I measure as you can see right there and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
I measure as you can see right there and
what<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> allows<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.650> can

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
what it allows you to do is you can

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
what it allows you to do is you can
measure<00:01:26.159> any<00:01:26.580> object<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.960> device<00:01:28.259> as

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
measure any object on your device as

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
measure any object on your device as
long<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> fits<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.759> screen<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
long as it fits on the screen and you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.780 
long as it fits on the screen and you
could<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.799> guess<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.220> had<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.549> big

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
could I guess you had a really big

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
could I guess you had a really big
object<00:01:33.270> object<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> measure<00:01:34.320> half<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
object object you can measure half of it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
object object you can measure half of it
or<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> part<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
or a part of it and then you know do the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.249 
or a part of it and then you know do the
math<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:39.390> how<00:01:39.840> big<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
math to see how actually how big it is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.550 
math to see how actually how big it is
but<00:01:40.970> here<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> measure<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.079> separate

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
but here is I measure it's a separate

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.249 
but here is I measure it's a separate
application<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.420> no<00:01:45.659> preferences

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
application and there are no preferences

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
application and there are no preferences
for<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> basically

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
for it and this is what it basically

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420 
for it and this is what it basically
allows<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.799> change<00:01:50.070> the

measure<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:59.280> basically<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
measure but basically what you do to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.120 
measure but basically what you do to
measure<00:02:01.079> something<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.710> choose<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
measure something is you choose the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
measure something is you choose the
basic<00:02:02.490> shape<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.270> put<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> object

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
basic shape and then you put the object

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
basic shape and then you put the object
you<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> measure<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.700> device's

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you want to measure on your device's

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.900 
you want to measure on your device's
screen<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:07.619> kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> reshape<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.670> shape

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
screen and you kind of reshape the shape

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.350 
screen and you kind of reshape the shape
until<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:10.020> fits<00:02:10.400> what<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.520> device<00:02:11.760> once<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
until it fits what your device once and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400 
until it fits what your device once and
you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> got<00:02:12.989> all<00:02:13.110> these<00:02:13.200> different

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you can you got all these different

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.910 
you can you got all these different
settings

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
convenient tweak I measure and so I'm

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.839 
convenient tweak I measure and so I'm
just<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.680> testing<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.610> and

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
just going to be testing it out here and

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.270 
just going to be testing it out here and
I'm<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:32.060> measure<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.480> circle<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.680> what<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
I'm going to measure a circle so what it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.949 
I'm going to measure a circle so what it
got<00:02:35.670> not<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> circle<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.569> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.750> measure<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
got not a circle I'm going to measure a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.229 
got not a circle I'm going to measure a
quarter<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.670> gives<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
quarter and what it gives you is it

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
quarter and what it gives you is it
gives<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> radius<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.530> diameter<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
gives you the radius the diameter and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.150 
gives you the radius the diameter and
the<00:02:41.430> length<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.860> basic

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the length so here I have just a basic

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.850 
the length so here I have just a basic
quarter<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.940> I'm<00:02:45.360> going<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> put<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.560> my

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
quarter and I'm going to put it on my

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.370 
quarter and I'm going to put it on my
high<00:02:47.010> device<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.610> make<00:02:47.760> sure<00:02:47.900> if<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.019> guys<00:02:49.170> do

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
high device and make sure if you guys do

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.199 
high device and make sure if you guys do
get<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.709> tweak<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.430> measure<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> do

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
get this tweak I measure that you do

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.690 
get this tweak I measure that you do
have<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> screen<00:02:51.630> protector<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.110> because<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.709> if

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
have a screen protector on because I if

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.979 
have a screen protector on because I if
you<00:02:53.850> don't<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.510> don't<00:02:54.660> want<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> put

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
you don't then you don't want to put

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.210 
you don't then you don't want to put
something<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.410> could<00:02:55.560> possibly<00:02:55.890> scratch

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
something that could possibly scratch

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.610 
something that could possibly scratch
your<00:02:56.489> screen<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.660> as<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:57.989> see<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.170> put

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
your screen but as you can see just put

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620 
your screen but as you can see just put
the<00:02:58.920> object<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.760> your<00:02:59.910> screen<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.390> try

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the object on your screen and you try

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.979 
the object on your screen and you try
your<00:03:00.780> best<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.319> resize<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:03.060> circle<00:03:03.780> or

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
your best just to resize the circle or

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.420 
your best just to resize the circle or
the<00:03:04.440> square<00:03:04.739> whatever<00:03:05.130> you're<00:03:05.220> trying<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the square whatever you're trying to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.660 
the square whatever you're trying to
measure<00:03:05.600> resize<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.500> actual<00:03:07.860> objects

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
measure resize it to the actual objects

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.860 
measure resize it to the actual objects
shape<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:11.660> dimensions<00:03:12.660> will

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
shape and then the dimensions will

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440 
shape and then the dimensions will
actually<00:03:13.200> change<00:03:13.530> while<00:03:13.860> you're<00:03:14.450> changing

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
actually change while you're changing

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.170 
actually change while you're changing
the<00:03:15.660> shape<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.440> as<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.489> see<00:03:17.730> there<00:03:17.970> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the shape so as you can see there I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.170 
the shape so as you can see there I
adjusted<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> circle<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:19.980> about<00:03:20.310> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
adjusted it so the circle is about the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
adjusted it so the circle is about the
same<00:03:21.359> as<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.630> quarter<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.170> gives<00:03:22.320> me<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
same as the quarter and it gives me the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.830 
same as the quarter and it gives me the
radius<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.250> diameter<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.090> length<00:03:24.570> of

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
radius the diameter and the length of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.030 
radius the diameter and the length of
the<00:03:24.959> quarter<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.769> for

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the quarter and you can do this for

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.099 
the quarter and you can do this for
anything<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:27.000> even<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.420> have<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> triangle

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
anything if even if you have a triangle

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.660 
anything if even if you have a triangle
it'll<00:03:28.260> also<00:03:28.410> give<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.799> angles<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.579> you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
it'll also give you the angles so you
