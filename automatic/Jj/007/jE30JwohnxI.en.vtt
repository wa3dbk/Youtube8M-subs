00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the way that opponents had to look into

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140 
the way that opponents had to look into
his<00:00:12.960> face<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.380> he<00:00:13.469> defended<00:00:13.920> rod<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:14.940> very

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
his face when he defended rod was very

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
his face when he defended rod was very
good<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.509> us<00:00:15.630> at<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> point<00:00:16.109> guard<00:00:16.199> position

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
good with us at the point guard position

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.529 
good with us at the point guard position
and<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.039> did<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> drill<00:00:17.520> almost<00:00:17.880> every<00:00:18.180> day

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and we did a drill almost every day

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
and we did a drill almost every day
one-on-one<00:00:19.250> between<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> free-throw<00:00:20.760> line

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
one-on-one between the free-throw line

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.160 
one-on-one between the free-throw line
Kingston<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> free-throw<00:00:22.109> line

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
Kingston and not the free-throw line

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
Kingston and not the free-throw line
extended<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> free<00:00:23.189> throw<00:00:23.369> lanes

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
extended but the free throw lanes

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
extended but the free throw lanes
extended<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.779> we'll<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.140> offensive

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
extended so we'll have an offensive

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.730 
extended so we'll have an offensive
player<00:00:25.710> right<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:25.980> Francis<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.500> Ryan<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
player right here Francis and Ryan you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.259 
player right here Francis and Ryan you
pick<00:00:29.099> him<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.609> Brett<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.150> here

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
pick him up or Brett you're out here

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.250 
pick him up or Brett you're out here
already<00:00:30.539> pick<00:00:30.750> him<00:00:30.869> up

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
already pick him up

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
already pick him up
so<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> rule<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.170> Francis

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
so the rule in this is that Francis

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.680 
so the rule in this is that Francis
cannot<00:00:34.469> turn<00:00:34.680> his<00:00:34.829> back<00:00:35.010> he<00:00:35.910> cannot<00:00:36.300> reverse

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
cannot turn his back he cannot reverse

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
cannot turn his back he cannot reverse
dribble<00:00:36.899> by<00:00:37.140> turning<00:00:37.500> his<00:00:37.620> back<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
dribble by turning his back because this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490 
dribble by turning his back because this
drill<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> done<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.690> reasons<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.230> want<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
drill is done for two reasons we want to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
drill is done for two reasons we want to
be<00:00:40.559> able<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> penetrate<00:00:40.920> against<00:00:41.489> Brett<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
be able to penetrate against Brett but

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.790 
be able to penetrate against Brett but
we<00:00:42.510> also<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.110> able<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.590> sure

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we also want to be able to make sure

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.260 
we also want to be able to make sure
that<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> got<00:00:44.190> our<00:00:44.309> eyes<00:00:44.430> open<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that we got our eyes open and see all of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.900 
that we got our eyes open and see all of
our<00:00:45.480> entry<00:00:46.079> passes<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:47.160> four<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.550> offense

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
our entry passes in our four up offense

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
our entry passes in our four up offense
so<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.780> turn<00:00:48.960> our<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.350> we've<00:00:49.739> lost

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so if we turn our back we've lost

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.180 
so if we turn our back we've lost
momentum<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:51.390> our<00:00:51.570> teammates<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.920> drill

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
is to stay within this free-throw Lane
