00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
completely covered it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.870 
completely covered it
this<00:00:27.230> is<00:00:27.380> actually<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.859> old<00:00:27.980> body<00:00:28.220> style<00:00:28.400> of

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
this is actually the old body style of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.630 
this is actually the old body style of
the<00:00:29.029> car<00:00:29.570> I<00:00:29.599> just<00:00:29.990> retrofitted<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.009> front<00:00:31.340> end

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
the car I just retrofitted the front end

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.549 
the car I just retrofitted the front end
to<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:32.029> newer<00:00:32.239> body<00:00:32.570> style<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.170> that's<00:00:33.320> why<00:00:33.500> it

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
to the newer body style so that's why it

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.020 
to the newer body style so that's why it
seems<00:00:33.890> more<00:00:34.280> boxy<00:00:34.970> so<00:00:36.340> this<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.519> completely

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
seems more boxy so this is completely

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.259 
seems more boxy so this is completely
painted<00:00:38.629> in<00:00:38.780> bedliner<00:00:39.260> though<00:00:39.649> I<00:00:40.059> got<00:00:41.059> some

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.450 
painted in bedliner though I got some
17-inch<00:00:42.199> tuner<00:00:42.680> wheels<00:00:42.980> on<00:00:43.159> there<00:00:43.339> I'm

17-inch tuner wheels on there I'm

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.189 
17-inch tuner wheels on there I'm
looking<00:00:43.730> at<00:00:43.850> change<00:00:44.480> them<00:00:44.629> out<00:00:44.720> because<00:00:45.050> the

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
looking at change them out because the

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.389 
looking at change them out because the
backs<00:00:45.470> look<00:00:45.980> pretty<00:00:46.280> thin<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:48.829> be<00:00:48.949> happy<00:00:49.250> with

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
backs look pretty thin to be happy with

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.950 
backs look pretty thin to be happy with
all<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.579> bedliner<00:00:49.879> looks<00:00:50.300> there's<00:00:50.570> kind<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:50.870> a

all the bedliner looks there's kind of a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.979 
all the bedliner looks there's kind of a
gap<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.470> right<00:00:51.829> here<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.010> got<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.309> fix<00:00:52.550> this<00:00:52.989> but
