since the big drop after the fraud case
ever<00:04:20.100> since<00:04:20.340> then<00:04:20.549> it's<00:04:20.700> kind<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:20.880> just

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
ever since then it's kind of just

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.670 
ever since then it's kind of just
hovering<00:04:21.330> now<00:04:21.539> in<00:04:21.810> fact<00:04:22.080> you're<00:04:22.169> making<00:04:22.470> some

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
hovering now in fact you're making some

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.650 
hovering now in fact you're making some
sort<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.950> little<00:04:23.100> triangular<00:04:23.669> pattern<00:04:24.030> here

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
sort of little triangular pattern here

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.210 
sort of little triangular pattern here
take<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> look<00:04:25.020> at<00:04:25.200> this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
take a look at this

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.890 
take a look at this
notice<00:04:26.670> from<00:04:26.760> this<00:04:26.940> pivot<00:04:27.270> hi<00:04:27.390> right<00:04:27.630> here

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
notice from this pivot hi right here

notice from this pivot hi right here
connected<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.680> high<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:29.640> high

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
connected to this high and to this high

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.920 
connected to this high and to this high
you<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.150> little<00:04:30.330> bit<00:04:30.450> of<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.570> triangular

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
you have a little bit of a triangular

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.600 
you have a little bit of a triangular
pattern<00:04:31.260> there<00:04:31.620> then<00:04:31.890> if<00:04:32.010> you<00:04:32.100> take<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.400> lows

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
pattern there then if you take the lows

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.670 
pattern there then if you take the lows
here<00:04:33.030> let's<00:04:33.330> take<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.720> low<00:04:33.990> pivot<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.470> just

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
here let's take this low pivot and just

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.140 
here let's take this low pivot and just
connect<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:35.040> right<00:04:35.220> through<00:04:35.400> look<00:04:35.910> at<00:04:35.970> that

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
connect it right through look at that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.850 
connect it right through look at that
hovering<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.020> right<00:04:37.350> now<00:04:37.530> you're<00:04:37.740> hovering

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
hovering and right now you're hovering

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.650 
hovering and right now you're hovering
on<00:04:38.100> support<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.670> which<00:04:39.030> way<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.450> going<00:04:39.600> to
