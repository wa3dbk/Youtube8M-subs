these two exercises are often confused

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.090 
these two exercises are often confused
as<00:00:27.560> being<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:27.980> same<00:00:28.220> thing<00:00:28.360> but<00:00:29.360> they're<00:00:29.599> not

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
as being the same thing but they're not
