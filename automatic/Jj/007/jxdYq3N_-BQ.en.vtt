00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.869
 television consumption that young people in Medellin 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.770

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.750
 what are the habits motivations 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.730

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.490
 in the young audience 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.300
 we meet then they want there to be a very big expert 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.850

 nocturnal skies predominate and on the weekends the schedules contrary to the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 study 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.630
 This also determined that consumption will be much more than 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.440
 contents are fiction 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.490
 e talking about telenovelas movies and in the low percentages but also 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 important in terms of what documentaries have to do with the musical 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.850
 he explained everything that has to do with sports 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.700
 In any case, the contents that affect a lot that what the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.510
 boys 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.870
 percent determined by the next act and that representation is 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.140
 the one that the characters of the uncertain television calvente 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.550
 in what they do 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.870
 in this way what is most superficial the most external is everything 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.530
 that include within their social nucleus young people is known that there is a great 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.690
 identification on television and especially young people looking for 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 certification in those images and the messages they are looking for 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420
 is determinant then 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.620
 cobo that part of the identification influences all the work and in the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 growth and personality development of young people 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.519
 that's where we find then 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.959
 that in our local regional and national channels 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.999
 percent public determination 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.529
 there is no 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.710
 a true sense of belonging on the part of young people 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.860
 the television that young people consume publicly is not very small and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.580
 any 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.490
 and it is not represented in it then there is a framework in which you must put 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.840
 a lot of tension and that television content is creating for the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.960
 young for what serious stick and identification by the way of all 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.240
 forms is very important then what television and our television 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.110
 local this regional television 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.279
 our national public television 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.949
 let's suspend this audience 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.889
 to pay more attention to the sense of belonging the boys 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.099
 of our research research we identify what they want 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.139
 that they know them they want to see who is 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 who excelled in his activities 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.289
