00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.899
 in life we ​​make many comparisons we say that life looks like a movie 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:16.909
 life is like a train 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.289
 life is like a wheel with descents ascents 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.240
 but what I'm sure ladies gentlemen that this one agrees in 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.239
 that life is also a path with ups and downs 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.419
 smooth and stony that make us stumble and often fall the blows 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.240
 of life must mold us 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.050
 but many cases like that sometimes we get hooked with the past and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.750
 we suffer a lot in the present has happened to him that he stumbles or what is with the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.600
 same stone 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.649
 and I do not mean only sentimental relationships and not that anger 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.710
 recurrent 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 this jealousy that you promised not to feel again and ista another 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.160
 once waxing set 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.580
 we will all find stones in our walk, the important thing is to learn from 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.780
 each of the setbacks of each of the falls and that is the process 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.710
 to advance 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.200
 the fact of recognizing that the same mistakes are always made 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.990
 They recognize that they advance a lot because after those who never recognize them, they continue 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.760
 falling again and again in the same problem 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.300
 that's why I'm going to give you some tips 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.560
 very simple are three recommendations so that it does not propitiate with the same stone 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 first 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.649
 It is good to learn to know ourselves better 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.960
 spend more time with ourselves 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 meditate on what we could improve in our own lives 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.770
 this in order not to make the same mistakes 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.840
 the second 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 I also recommend that you read read a lot 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.240
 reading the great thinkers and the great philosophers 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.460
 will you have a deeper insight into the universe from which all 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 we are parties and the third to set short-term goals if you want to change 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.900
 it's very difficult overnight 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.990
 what happens a frog is encouraged to a tub with water 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.560
 boiling 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.060
 the Frog jumps 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 but the little frog is blown and the water is tempering and shooting is going up the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.299
 temperature the frog or account is given when it dies so should be the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.760
 changes calmly 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.460
 d enda terms 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.959
 short and above all going and evaluating them I assure you that changing is worth it and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 more so as not to trip over the same stone 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:16.529
 until next time
