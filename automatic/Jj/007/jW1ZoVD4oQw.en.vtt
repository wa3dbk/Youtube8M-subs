so<00:00:31.500> I've<00:00:31.679> time<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.279> five<00:00:32.640> times<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.050> can

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
so I've time this five times so you can

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040 
so I've time this five times so you can
see<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.770> all<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.010> screen<00:00:35.280> now<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.050> we're

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
see them all on screen now and we're

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
see them all on screen now and we're
just<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.829> long<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> takes<00:00:38.809> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
just going to see how long it takes and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
just going to see how long it takes and
I'm<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> fill<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.559> boredom<00:00:41.100> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I'm going to fill in this boredom with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.600 
I'm going to fill in this boredom with
how<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> hard<00:00:42.270> drive<00:00:42.510> works<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.520> we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
how a hard drive works so what do we

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
how a hard drive works so what do we
have<00:00:44.730> inside<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.239> hard<00:00:45.450> drive<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.320> remember

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
have inside a hard drive you remember

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.690 
have inside a hard drive you remember
from<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.860> other<00:00:46.950> videos<00:00:47.280> where<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> take

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
from my other videos where I take

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.190 
from my other videos where I take
magnets<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> hard<00:00:48.719> drive<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> get

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
magnets out of the hard drive you get

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
magnets out of the hard drive you get
some<00:00:49.350> nice<00:00:49.469> neodymium<00:00:50.070> super-strong<00:00:50.820> magnets

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
some nice neodymium super-strong magnets

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
some nice neodymium super-strong magnets
out<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.600> them<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.350> other<00:00:52.590> than<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> magnets

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
out of them but other than the magnets

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.979 
out of them but other than the magnets
in<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.640> there's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> lot<00:00:54.210> more<00:00:54.239> stuff<00:00:54.629> going

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
in there there's a lot more stuff going

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.350 
in there there's a lot more stuff going
on<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.710> each<00:00:55.920> individual<00:00:56.760> platter<00:00:57.000> now

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
on you have each individual platter now

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.060 
on you have each individual platter now
desktop<00:00:57.840> hard<00:00:57.960> drives<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.710> three

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
desktop hard drives you can have three

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.090 
desktop hard drives you can have three
maybe<00:00:59.640> even<00:00:59.730> four<00:00:59.969> platters<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
maybe even four platters in one and you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.770 
maybe even four platters in one and you
have<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.489> spindle<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.120> spins<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> round

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have the spindle which spins it round

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.170 
have the spindle which spins it round
you<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.369> reader<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.939> head

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you then have the reader right head

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
you then have the reader right head
which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.630> able<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.020> modify<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:07.830> read<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
which is able to modify or read the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.980 
which is able to modify or read the
magnetization<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> material

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
magnetization of the material

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
magnetization of the material
immediately<00:01:10.260> under<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
immediately under it now that's the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
immediately under it now that's the
platter<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.689> platter<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.350> made<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
platter so the platter can be made of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.719 
platter so the platter can be made of
aluminium<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:15.060> glass<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> ceramics<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> data

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
aluminium or glass and ceramics and data

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.210 
aluminium or glass and ceramics and data
can<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.000> stored<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.540> either<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> them<00:01:19.590> but

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
can be stored on either side of them but

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
can be stored on either side of them but
why<00:01:20.460> does<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> take<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.210> long<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> data

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
why does it take so long to get the data

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.660 
why does it take so long to get the data
off<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> talk

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
off them that is what I'm here to talk

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
off them that is what I'm here to talk
about<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.689> mostly<00:01:25.049> comes<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> seek

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
about it mostly comes down to the seek

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
about it mostly comes down to the seek
time<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.850> long<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> takes<00:01:27.390> from<00:01:27.540> CPU<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
time it's how long it takes from CPU to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
time it's how long it takes from CPU to
request<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> file<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.400> hard<00:01:29.579> drive<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
request to file and the hard drive to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420 
request to file and the hard drive to
send<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> file<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.049> CPU<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.310> this

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
send the file to the CPU now this

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190 
send the file to the CPU now this
usually<00:01:32.790> takes<00:01:33.030> between<00:01:33.150> 10<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.840> 20

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
usually takes between 10 and 20

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.600 
usually takes between 10 and 20
milliseconds<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.070> times<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.579> vary

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
milliseconds but times can vary

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.130 
milliseconds but times can vary
depending<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> age<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.659> hard<00:01:36.900> drive

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
depending on the age of your hard drive

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.100 
depending on the age of your hard drive
now<00:01:38.070> why<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.549> takes<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> long<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
now why is this takes so long well the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.810 
now why is this takes so long well the
hard<00:01:40.290> drive<00:01:40.530> has<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> find<00:01:41.250> where<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> file

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
hard drive has to find where that file

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
hard drive has to find where that file
is<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.299> your<00:01:42.479> hard<00:01:42.630> drive<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.409> stored

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is on your hard drive it is stored

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
is on your hard drive it is stored
physically<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> memory<00:01:45.840> stick

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
physically it is not like a memory stick

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
physically it is not like a memory stick
and<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.619> file<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.070> inside<00:01:47.490> some<00:01:47.880> sort<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> chip

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and the file is inside some sort of chip

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.679 
and the file is inside some sort of chip
somewhere<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> physically<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
somewhere but it is physically on that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.499 
somewhere but it is physically on that
hard<00:01:51.840> drive<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.189> actuator<00:01:53.579> arm<00:01:53.820> moves<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
hard drive so the actuator arm moves the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
hard drive so the actuator arm moves the
read<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.899> write<00:01:54.960> head<00:01:55.320> over<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> platter

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
read and write head over on the platter

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
read and write head over on the platter
to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.119> individual<00:01:57.990> file<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.469> only<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.100> is

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
to the individual file and only then is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480 
to the individual file and only then is
able<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.850> send<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> file<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.899> CPU<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:02.189> as

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.070 
which is about twice as fast as SATA 2
but<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.300> we're<00:02:21.630> about<00:02:21.780> two

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
but as you can see we're about two

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.809 
but as you can see we're about two
minutes<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.130> laptop<00:02:23.250> still

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the laptop is booted I have minecraft so

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.979 
the laptop is booted I have minecraft so

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
here's my solid state drive I'm going to

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.259 
here's my solid state drive I'm going to
open<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.620> up<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.280> using<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.610> little<00:03:08.880> knife<00:03:09.060> we

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
open it up so using this little knife we

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.960 
open it up so using this little knife we
get<00:03:09.450> inside<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.680> samsung<00:03:11.280> 830

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
get inside it this is the samsung 830

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
is this is the 256 gigabytes dispersion

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.870 
is this is the 256 gigabytes dispersion
and<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.260> very<00:03:22.560> light<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.519> what<00:03:23.640> else<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:23.850> we

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and it is very light so what else do we

it's just not good enough anymore but
for<00:04:58.980> now<00:04:59.100> we'll<00:04:59.340> have<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.580> make<00:04:59.700> do<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.390> we're

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
for now we'll have to make do so we're

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.880

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.200 
same apart from the solid state software
I<00:05:21.990> had<00:05:22.200> to<00:05:22.350> install<00:05:22.680> on<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.100> laptop<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:24.180> is

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
I had to install on the laptop that is

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.270 
I had to install on the laptop that is
the<00:05:24.450> only<00:05:24.570> difference<00:05:24.810> but<00:05:25.590> look<00:05:25.889> how<00:05:26.100> much

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
the only difference but look how much

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.760 
the only difference but look how much
faster<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.820> is<00:05:27.030> now<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.780> only<00:05:28.139> problems<00:05:28.590> with

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
faster it is now the only problems with

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.080 
faster it is now the only problems with
the<00:05:28.830> solid<00:05:28.979> state<00:05:29.250> drive<00:05:29.520> have<00:05:29.790> been<00:05:29.940> the

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
the solid state drive have been the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.120 
the solid state drive have been the
capacity<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.840> price<00:05:31.139> but<00:05:31.560> recently<00:05:31.919> the

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
capacity and the price but recently the

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.010 
capacity and the price but recently the
price<00:05:32.340> has<00:05:32.520> hit<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.820> floor<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.600> get<00:05:33.840> less

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
price has hit the floor you get less

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.300 
price has hit the floor you get less
than<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.260> pound<00:05:34.440> gigabyte<00:05:34.860> now<00:05:35.040> and<00:05:35.250> the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
than the pound gigabyte now and the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.310 
than the pound gigabyte now and the
capacity<00:05:35.460> is<00:05:35.820> ever<00:05:35.970> increasing<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.810> look<00:05:37.229> at

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
capacity is ever increasing and look at

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.050 
capacity is ever increasing and look at
the<00:05:37.410> time<00:05:37.620> so<00:05:37.890> is<00:05:38.010> such<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.280> difference<00:05:38.820> there

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
the time so is such a difference there

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.909 
the time so is such a difference there
now<00:05:39.930> I'm<00:05:40.020> not<00:05:40.169> sure<00:05:40.320> if<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.500> was<00:05:40.650> just<00:05:40.830> a

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
now I'm not sure if this was just a

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.500 
now I'm not sure if this was just a
problem<00:05:41.190> with<00:05:41.280> my<00:05:41.370> laptop<00:05:41.580> but<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.180> couldn't
