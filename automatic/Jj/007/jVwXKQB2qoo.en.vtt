00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
linear and it also has a lot of cool

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.459 
linear and it also has a lot of cool
verticality<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> each<00:00:45.870> side<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
verticality to it each side is going to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.549 
verticality to it each side is going to
have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:47.600> platform<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.200> couple<00:00:49.379> of
