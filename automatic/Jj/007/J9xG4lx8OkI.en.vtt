00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
blood spattering we use something called

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.740 
blood spattering we use something called
a<00:00:21.480> chip<00:00:21.750> brush<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.029> saturate<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
a chip brush and you just saturate it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.279 
a chip brush and you just saturate it
with<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:25.619> real<00:00:25.830> thinned<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.310> blood<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
with some real thinned out blood and

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.839 
with some real thinned out blood and
then<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> literally<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:29.099> take<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
then you literally just take it and you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.260 
then you literally just take it and you
do<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.590> that's<00:00:35.430> how<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:36.120> those

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
do this and that's how you get all those

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.639 
do this and that's how you get all those
crazy<00:00:36.829> like<00:00:37.829> splatter<00:00:38.340> marks<00:00:38.660> everywhere

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.770 

let's<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.829> him<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.750> very

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
let's see him up in there and it's very

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.889 
let's see him up in there and it's very
messy<00:00:46.200> works<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.520> though

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.299 

and<00:00:54.899> that's<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> spattered

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and that's how you get that spattered

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
and that's how you get that spattered
look<00:00:56.550> depending<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.329> how<00:00:57.539> much<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> how<00:00:58.079> big

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
look depending on how much and how big

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840 
look depending on how much and how big
your<00:00:58.350> brush<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.699> little

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
your brush is this is for really little

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
your brush is this is for really little
spattering<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
spattering so you can see what that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.869 
spattering so you can see what that
looks<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
looks like

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.230 
looks like
that's<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.750> boar<00:01:03.989> bristle<00:01:04.439> brush<00:01:04.939> but<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> do

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that's a boar bristle brush but you do

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
that's a boar bristle brush but you do
have<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> thin<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> blood<00:01:07.320> enough<00:01:07.770> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
have to thin out the blood enough so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
have to thin out the blood enough so
that<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.280> spatter<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.600> otherwise

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that it will spatter that way otherwise

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
that it will spatter that way otherwise
the<00:01:09.930> thick<00:01:10.320> blood<00:01:10.530> doesn't<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.010> work<00:01:11.220> very

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the thick blood doesn't really work very

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.039 
the thick blood doesn't really work very
well

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
well

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.859 
well
effect<00:01:13.049> doesn't<00:01:13.350> work<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.689> how

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
effect doesn't work at all so that's how

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.980 
effect doesn't work at all so that's how
you<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.939> now<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> move<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.780> to

let's say you're doing the hands you

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.589 
let's say you're doing the hands you
could<00:02:23.010> start<00:02:23.310> by<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.700> spraying<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.330> hand

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
could start by just spraying the hand

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.000 
could start by just spraying the hand
and<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.110> course<00:02:25.290> that's<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> look

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and of course that's just going to look

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
and of course that's just going to look
like<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.780> want<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.170> really

it like underneath the fingernails and
into<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.610> take<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.630> get

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it right up underneath the fingernails

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.199 
it right up underneath the fingernails
like<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.569> grind<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
like that really grind it in to the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.160 
like that really grind it in to the
cuticle<00:02:45.569> area<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:48.090> will<00:02:48.209> need<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.450> brush<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
cuticle area you will need a brush to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.039 
cuticle area you will need a brush to
get<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.440> off<00:02:49.650> eventually<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.840> that's<00:02:51.840> how

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
get this off eventually but that's how

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.630 
get this off eventually but that's how
you<00:02:52.110> start<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.769> hands<00:02:53.040> getting<00:02:53.430> it

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you start with the hands getting it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.089 
you start with the hands getting it
right<00:02:53.819> up<00:02:54.030> into<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.569> fingers<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.920> will

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
right up into the fingers but this will

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.490 
right up into the fingers but this will
really<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.730> right<00:03:00.030> into<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.540> creases<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
really get it right into the creases and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.569 
really get it right into the creases and
crevices<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:04.040> make<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.070> look<00:03:05.250> like

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
crevices and really make it look like

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.160 
crevices and really make it look like
they're<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:05.970> dirty<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:07.019> not

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
they're really dirty and that's just not

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:16.699 
they're really dirty and that's just not
sitting<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.709> top<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.220> skin

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.670 

and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.700> always<00:03:17.939> add<00:03:18.230> some<00:03:19.230> powders

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and then you can always add some powders

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.740 
and then you can always add some powders
to<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.340> really<00:03:20.519> make<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:21.030> show<00:03:21.299> up<00:03:21.329> really

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
to that to really make it show up really

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.850 
to that to really make it show up really
well<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:25.860> can<00:03:26.040> use<00:03:26.189> straight<00:03:26.489> pigments<00:03:30.860> and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
well you can use straight pigments and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.559 
well you can use straight pigments and
powders<00:03:32.549> will<00:03:32.730> always<00:03:33.060> appear<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.420> lot

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
powders will always appear a lot

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.809 
powders will always appear a lot
stronger<00:03:33.930> because<00:03:34.140> they<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.069> basically<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
stronger because they are basically the

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.059 
stronger because they are basically the
pure<00:03:36.239> pigment<00:03:36.689> that<00:03:36.840> year<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.560> I'm<00:03:37.680> talking

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
pure pigment that year and I'm talking

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.309 
pure pigment that year and I'm talking
about<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:39.420> here's<00:03:39.659> some<00:03:39.900> actual<00:03:40.680> real<00:03:42.319> dark

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
about so here's some actual real dark

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.530 
about so here's some actual real dark
pigments<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.189> can<00:03:44.370> add<00:03:44.909> to<00:03:44.939> it<00:03:45.299> to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
pigments that you can add to it to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.860 
pigments that you can add to it to
really<00:03:46.280> get<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.430> good<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.790> grimy<00:03:48.000> looking<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
really get it good and grimy looking and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.899 
really get it good and grimy looking and
don't<00:03:55.049> forget<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.470> insides<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.220> hands<00:03:56.760> as

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
don't forget the insides of the hands as

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:03.319 
don't forget the insides of the hands as
well<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.359> want<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.629> really<00:04:01.909> grind<00:04:02.909> that<00:04:03.120> in

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
well you want to really grind that in

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:16.699 
well you want to really grind that in
really<00:04:03.659> well<00:04:06.560> no<00:04:07.560> let's<00:04:07.889> keep<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:15.709> mixing

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
really well no let's keep this mixing

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.310 
really well no let's keep this mixing
together<00:04:16.889> get<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:17.820> palms<00:04:18.120> really<00:04:18.539> good<00:04:18.750> but

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
together get the palms really good but

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.140 
together get the palms really good but
basically<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.979> technique<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.639> get<00:04:20.970> that

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
basically the technique is to get that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.710 
basically the technique is to get that
just<00:04:21.570> really<00:04:22.550> grimed<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:23.940> there<00:04:24.180> really<00:04:24.419> well

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
just really grimed in there really well

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.830 
just really grimed in there really well
you<00:04:25.260> want<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.500> get<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.770> into<00:04:25.949> all<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.840> surfaces

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
you want to get it into all the surfaces

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.110 
you want to get it into all the surfaces
the<00:04:28.020> cracks<00:04:28.320> all<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.800> dry<00:04:29.039> skin<00:04:29.099> places<00:04:29.940> and

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
the cracks all the dry skin places and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.879 
the cracks all the dry skin places and
just<00:04:30.150> get<00:04:30.449> really<00:04:30.720> get<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.139> in<00:04:31.320> there<00:04:31.560> worked

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
just get really get it in there worked

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.339 
just get really get it in there worked
in<00:04:32.099> well<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.669> skin<00:04:32.970> at<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.930> point<00:04:34.229> you

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
in well to the skin at this point you

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.020 
in well to the skin at this point you
can<00:04:34.500> go<00:04:34.650> back<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.070> do<00:04:35.190> some<00:04:35.370> cool<00:04:35.610> stuff<00:04:35.909> like

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
can go back and do some cool stuff like

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.060 
can go back and do some cool stuff like
do<00:04:36.270> little<00:04:36.510> scratches<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.349> methyls

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.760 

sometimes<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.220> like<00:04:41.430> using<00:04:42.199> this<00:04:43.199> brush<00:04:43.530> which

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
sometimes I like using this brush which

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.310 
sometimes I like using this brush which
I<00:04:43.889> actually<00:04:44.099> used<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.970> put<00:04:45.479> glue<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:45.780> beards

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
I actually used to put glue on beards

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.990 
I actually used to put glue on beards
with<00:04:46.500> but<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.770> like<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.130> make<00:04:47.310> use<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.729> to<00:04:47.849> make

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
with but I like to make use it to make

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.370 
with but I like to make use it to make
scrapes<00:04:48.360> I'll<00:04:49.110> show<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.620> how<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.800> do<00:04:49.949> that<00:04:50.270> and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
scrapes I'll show you how to do that and

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.360 
scrapes I'll show you how to do that and
you<00:04:52.380> can<00:04:52.500> go<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:52.889> give<00:04:53.039> them<00:04:53.159> a<00:04:53.190> little

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
you can go in and give them a little

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.950 
you can go in and give them a little
fused<00:04:54.000> little<00:04:54.240> scratches<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.169> there<00:04:56.960> so

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
fused little scratches here and there so

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.719 
fused little scratches here and there so
it<00:04:58.080> works<00:04:58.260> really<00:04:58.500> well<00:04:58.620> just<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.190> create<00:04:59.430> some

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
it works really well just to create some

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.480 
it works really well just to create some
like<00:04:59.880> real<00:05:00.120> broad<00:05:00.830> scrape<00:05:01.830> marks<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.340> can

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
like real broad scrape marks you can

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.770 
like real broad scrape marks you can
just<00:05:02.669> do<00:05:02.789> it<00:05:02.909> like<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.419> will<00:05:03.570> create

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
just do it like that and it will create

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.149
