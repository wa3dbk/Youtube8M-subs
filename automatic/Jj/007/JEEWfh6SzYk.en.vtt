 hi guys i was for johnny 01 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.010
 today i will play minecraft will not do 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.980
 tutorial I'll do in a kind of gameplay 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.279
 now I have created a new world and I have 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.050
 found this little house that now like 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.960
 I am modified by myself because I was the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.779
 return from a long one from a long one 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.689
 mission that is to find the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.969
 coal and I found these houses I have 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 said oh well I do this house 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.059
 there was almost nothing there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 then I turn and find that of the other 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 home so I consider myself very lucky 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:52.680
 now two houses just now a little 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.570
 change and I have to put a bed in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.570
 we have to put that other house 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 what is it called in practice for 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:17.700
 you but kilns kill you 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 I don't know how he puts this anyway 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.850
 may be fine but we miss it 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.920
 the wool does not give it from the house 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.460
 anyway I'm very happy because I was 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.300
 desperate, really desperate and not 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.760
 I could just find the house 15 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:53.180
 I was almost two hours an hour in an hour 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.180
 but there is
