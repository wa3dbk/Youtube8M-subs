whatever<00:02:34.930> they're<00:02:35.930> good<00:02:36.139> I<00:02:36.549> thought<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
whatever they're good I thought the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.220 
whatever they're good I thought the
designs<00:02:38.090> would<00:02:38.299> be<00:02:38.389> a<00:02:38.420> little<00:02:38.630> bit<00:02:38.750> better<00:02:38.930> but

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
designs would be a little bit better but

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.809 
designs would be a little bit better but
they're<00:02:39.500> really<00:02:39.620> not<00:02:40.269> not<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.420> impressed

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
they're really not not that impressed

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.020 
they're really not not that impressed
but<00:02:43.819> I<00:02:44.980> was<00:02:45.980> surprised<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:46.519> individually

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
but I was surprised it was individually

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.069 
but I was surprised it was individually
wrapped<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.359> didn't<00:02:47.510> think<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.720> would<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.959> like

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
wrapped I didn't think it would be like

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.319 
wrapped I didn't think it would be like
that<00:02:50.139> so<00:02:51.139> there<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.410> have<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:52.329> good

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
that so there you have it it's a good

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.840 
that so there you have it it's a good
treat<00:02:53.709> soldered<00:02:54.709> four<00:02:54.920> out<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.069> five<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.609> fun
