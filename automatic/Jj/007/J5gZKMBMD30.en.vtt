00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
generally a pretty shy turtle as you can

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.450 
generally a pretty shy turtle as you can
see<00:00:44.940> he<00:00:45.000> already<00:00:45.149> sucked<00:00:45.510> back<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> his<00:00:45.870> shell

see he already sucked back in his shell
they're<00:00:47.460> mostly<00:00:47.760> omnivores<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.899> find

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
they're mostly omnivores but I do find

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.540 
they're mostly omnivores but I do find
that<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.469> tend<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> scavenge<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> lot<00:00:50.430> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that they tend to scavenge a lot on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.610 
that they tend to scavenge a lot on
carrion<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:51.870> much<00:00:51.989> picking<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.440> whatever

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
carrion pretty much picking up whatever

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
carrion pretty much picking up whatever
they<00:00:52.920> come<00:00:53.100> across<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.079> felt<00:00:55.199> like

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
they come across so I just felt like

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
they come across so I just felt like
sharing<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.770> got<00:00:55.980> idea<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.460> like

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sharing this little got idea I do like

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.869 
sharing this little got idea I do like
them<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.329> neat<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:58.289> guys<00:00:58.730> go<00:00:59.730> ahead

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
them they are neat little guys go ahead

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:10.390 
them they are neat little guys go ahead
let<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.149> go

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.920 

southern<00:01:11.400> ringneck<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.689> close

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
southern ringneck here is pretty close

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
southern ringneck here is pretty close
to<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.890> range<00:01:14.100> extent<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to the actually range extent of the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.039 
to the actually range extent of the
northern<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.270> some<00:01:15.479> people<00:01:15.750> might<00:01:15.900> actually

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
northern so some people might actually

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.560 
northern so some people might actually
call<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> integrate<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:18.060> these<00:01:18.390> are

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
call this and integrate but these are

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
call this and integrate but these are
definitely<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.560> different<00:01:20.009> than<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
definitely a little different than the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.810 
definitely a little different than the
ones<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.479> north<00:01:21.930> where<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:22.680> from<00:01:22.950> we

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
ones we have up north where I'm from we

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
ones we have up north where I'm from we
got<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> belly<00:01:24.509> dots<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.080> these<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.560> don't

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
got a lot of belly dots on these I don't

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.899 
got a lot of belly dots on these I don't
know<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> could<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.790> not

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
know if you could see that well or not

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
know if you could see that well or not
but<00:01:27.150> sometimes<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> play

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
but sometimes you can get them to play

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
but sometimes you can get them to play
dead<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.860> I've<00:01:29.130> got<00:01:29.340> another<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
dead and I've got another one that I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.359 
dead and I've got another one that I
just<00:01:30.450> found<00:01:30.600> over<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:30.960> playing<00:01:31.350> dead<00:01:31.680> okay

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just found over here playing dead okay

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you can see this is one that was just on

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.210 
you can see this is one that was just on
the<00:01:34.020> ground<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:34.950> actually

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the ground you can see it's not actually

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
the ground you can see it's not actually
dead<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.210> playing<00:01:36.479> dead<00:01:36.780> that's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
dead it was just playing dead that's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
dead it was just playing dead that's
kind<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.829> neat<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:39.150> northern

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

kind of a neat little thing the northern
version<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> snake<00:01:40.860> does<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.310> behave

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
version of this snake does not behave

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
version of this snake does not behave
that<00:01:41.939> way<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> thought<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.619> kind<00:01:43.860> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that way but I thought that was kind of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.139 
that way but I thought that was kind of
interesting<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.549> interesting

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
interesting a little interesting

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.149 
interesting a little interesting
behavior<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.500> came<00:01:46.680> across<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
behavior there just came across this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.179 
behavior there just came across this
racer<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:47.880> gonna<00:01:47.970> try<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.270> catch<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.189> I'm

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

racer and I'm gonna try and catch it I'm
in<00:01:50.369> charge<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> camera<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.570> he

the<00:05:04.160> sides<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.840> need<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.050> little<00:05:06.170> guy<00:05:06.320> flip

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590

him<00:05:06.710> under<00:05:06.920> a<00:05:06.950> rock<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:07.430> still<00:05:07.910> raining<00:05:08.090> and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
starting to rain a little harder so we

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.540 
starting to rain a little harder so we
might<00:05:09.590> have<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.800> throw<00:05:09.920> in<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.130> towel<00:05:10.310> pretty
