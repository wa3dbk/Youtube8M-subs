00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
hi I'm Ken Powell and I'm just making

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.430 
hi I'm Ken Powell and I'm just making
this<00:00:36.879> short<00:00:37.120> video<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.540> show<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:37.930> how<00:00:38.230> my

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
this short video to show you how my

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.490 
this short video to show you how my
small<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.129> dragon<00:00:39.460> automata<00:00:40.000> works<00:00:40.500> I've

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
small the dragon automata works I've

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.229 
small the dragon automata works I've
removed<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.980> wings<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.519> can<00:00:42.730> see<00:00:42.910> it<00:00:43.030> more

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
removed the wings so you can see it more

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.160 
removed the wings so you can see it more
clearly<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.530> neck<00:00:44.739> was<00:00:45.070> made<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.430> two<00:00:45.640> parts

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
clearly the neck was made in two parts

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.209 
clearly the neck was made in two parts
leaving<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.260> channel<00:00:47.649> running<00:00:47.920> through<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
leaving a channel running through the

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.850 
leaving a channel running through the
middle<00:00:48.339> and<00:00:49.059> through<00:00:49.360> that<00:00:49.570> runs<00:00:49.839> a<00:00:50.110> piece<00:00:50.649> of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
middle and through that runs a piece of

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.619 
middle and through that runs a piece of
piano<00:00:51.100> wire<00:00:51.190> which<00:00:51.640> goes<00:00:51.850> from<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.149> tail<00:00:52.360> to

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
piano wire which goes from the tail to

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.310 
piano wire which goes from the tail to
the<00:00:53.110> jawbone<00:00:53.620> this<00:00:54.489> operates<00:00:54.909> on<00:00:55.059> account<00:00:55.420> and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
the jawbone this operates on account and

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.139 
the jawbone this operates on account and
allows<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:56.949> pick<00:00:57.220> up<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.640> release<00:00:57.909> the

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
allows it to pick up and release the

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.530 
allows it to pick up and release the
marble<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:03.430> for<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.699> marble<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.149> run<00:01:04.330> from

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
marble now for the marble to run from

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.520 
marble now for the marble to run from
one<00:01:04.690> side<00:01:04.899> to<00:01:04.929> the<00:01:05.170> other

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
one side to the other

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.630 
one side to the other
obviously<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.039> side<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.399> going<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.580> be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
obviously this side is going to be

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.639 
obviously this side is going to be
higher<00:01:06.820> than<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.210> side<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.470> head

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
higher than that side and so the head

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.340 
higher than that side and so the head
has<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:08.950> move<00:01:09.250> up<00:01:09.460> as<00:01:10.149> it<00:01:10.360> moves<00:01:10.390> around<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.960> as

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
has to move up as it moves around it as

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.580 
has to move up as it moves around it as
we<00:01:11.500> get<00:01:11.649> higher<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:13.240> achieve<00:01:13.479> this<00:01:13.690> with<00:01:14.410> this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
we get higher we achieve this with this

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.070 
we get higher we achieve this with this
shelf<00:01:15.190> here<00:01:15.280> which<00:01:15.610> runs<00:01:15.850> across<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.690> top<00:01:17.050> of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
shelf here which runs across the top of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.130 
shelf here which runs across the top of
the<00:01:17.500> belly<00:01:17.710> on<00:01:18.220> their<00:01:18.880> neck<00:01:19.149> just<00:01:19.479> rests<00:01:19.869> on<00:01:19.990> it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
the belly on their neck just rests on it

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.940 
the belly on their neck just rests on it
so<00:01:20.890> as<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.220> neck<00:01:21.640> moves<00:01:21.940> around<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.740> gets

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
so as the neck moves around it gets

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.029 
so as the neck moves around it gets
lower<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.490> way<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:26.440> then<00:01:26.560> when<00:01:26.740> it's<00:01:26.890> picked

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
lower that way and then when it's picked

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:36.130 
lower that way and then when it's picked
up<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.280> ball<00:01:28.530> gets<00:01:29.530> higher<00:01:29.770> again

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.899 

to<00:01:37.140> hold<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.710> release<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> marble<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> jaw

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
to hold on to release the marble the jaw

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.539 
to hold on to release the marble the jaw
is<00:01:39.119> operated<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> backside<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:41.189> lifts

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
is operated by the backside which lifts

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.620 
is operated by the backside which lifts
up<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> down<00:01:43.400> making<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.580> jaw<00:01:44.790> open<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
up and down making the jaw open and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.140 
up and down making the jaw open and
closed<00:01:46.100> that's<00:01:47.100> operated<00:01:47.700> by<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> can

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
closed that's operated by a can

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.980 
closed that's operated by a can
underneath<00:01:49.790> I'll<00:01:50.790> remove<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.330> i-beam<00:01:51.750> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
underneath I'll remove this i-beam so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.620 
underneath I'll remove this i-beam so
you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.380> inside<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.159> clearly

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
you can see inside a bit more clearly

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.249 
you can see inside a bit more clearly
hopefully<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.140> middle

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
hopefully you can see in the middle

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
hopefully you can see in the middle
there<00:01:55.380> there's<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> cam<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.580> as<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.850> turn<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
there there's the cam and as I turn the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.139 
there there's the cam and as I turn the
handle<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:58.680> cam<00:01:58.920> moves<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.399> pin<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.000> down

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
handle the cam moves the pin up and down

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.850 
handle the cam moves the pin up and down
which<00:02:00.299> operates<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> backside<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
which operates the backside of the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.029 
which operates the backside of the
Dragon<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> ultimately<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.360> jaw<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.890> get

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
Dragon and ultimately the jaw as you get

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.190 
Dragon and ultimately the jaw as you get
to<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.220> point<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.600> dragon<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
to this point now the dragon is just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.100 
to this point now the dragon is just
about<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.619> grab<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> hold<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.220> marble

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.770 

the<00:02:17.100> two<00:02:17.280> pins<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.730> see<00:02:18.060> moving<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the two pins you can see moving to the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.990 
the two pins you can see moving to the
left<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> cam<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.460> guide<00:02:20.700> pins

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
left of the cam are just the guide pins

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.160 
left of the cam are just the guide pins
for<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.240> backside<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:24.270> cogs<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.750> operate

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
for the backside the cogs which operate

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.110 
for the backside the cogs which operate
the<00:02:25.350> mechanism<00:02:25.470> are<00:02:25.920> very<00:02:26.100> simple<00:02:26.490> as<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.090> can

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the mechanism are very simple as you can

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.610 
the mechanism are very simple as you can
see<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> handle<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.870> turning<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.290> small

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
see the handle is turning that small

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.070 
see the handle is turning that small
star-shaped<00:02:29.010> cog<00:02:29.550> which<00:02:30.270> drives<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.870> pin

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
star-shaped cog which drives the pin

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.620 
star-shaped cog which drives the pin
wheel<00:02:31.260> behind<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:33.090> drives<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
wheel behind it and that drives the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.410 
wheel behind it and that drives the
other<00:02:33.750> pin<00:02:33.930> wheel<00:02:34.080> at<00:02:34.230> 90<00:02:34.530> degrees<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.070> it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
other pin wheel at 90 degrees to it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.790 
other pin wheel at 90 degrees to it
the<00:02:36.420> only<00:02:36.540> other<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.110> show<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:37.590> is

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
the only other bit to show you really is

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.440 
the only other bit to show you really is
this<00:02:37.950> beam<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> button<00:02:38.820> which<00:02:39.000> gives<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
this beam on the button which gives the
