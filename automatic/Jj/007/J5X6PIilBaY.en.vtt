00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.510
 this day the red card is for the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.150
 laziness we have to be clear with the 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.060
 laziness we are not going to get very far 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.850
 we will be disqualified in the first 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.000
 round and as far as I know our 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.640
 technical director summoned us not only 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.359
 to adapt saying I went to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.699
 world of life he did not invite us to 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.670
 be part of the select only to 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.969
 start but to finish and to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.940
 finish well he does not guarantee that at 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.629
 final we will be the team with the cup 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.520
 gold of eternity but for that 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.379
 we need to work to go to the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.680
 workouts do all the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.750
 exercises sweating the shirt walking with 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.899
 firmness but when we are indicated 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.679
 also run without stopping I hope that 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.050
 you as well as I want to get to the end and 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.770
 do not disappoint who can choose 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.270
 another chose you and chose me 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.880
 maybe sometimes your instructions 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.969
 look a bit intense 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.270
 to feel tired without strength and not 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.000
 more power the only thing I can tell you is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 that if he asks you to surrender in the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.509
 playground is because well you 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.950
 You can find two questions in the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.679
 proverb chapter 6 verse 9 lazy 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.079
 even when you have to sleep when you 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.020
 you will rise from your sleep 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:42.250
 some synonyms of laziness are 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.580
 lazy negligence lazy swore 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.450
 laziness and I added one more 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.450
 sin if laziness is a sin but not 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.899
 like others who complete the chain of 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.439
 others not this one generates many others 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.319
 sins more and that's why we need 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.590
 get it out without any mercy rejects 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:10.009
 of your life laziness and runs to the court 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.920
 take care of the defense brand legitimately as 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.160
 well pass them and in due time go to the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.510
 forward perhaps to goals a goal then 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.239
 in our team 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.519
 there is a bench to be seated all 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.700
 in one way or another we should be 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.810
 diligently workers but never 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.120
 Sleeping Lazy Sleeping 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 we have a championship to win 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.459
 today he took you red card if it is with you 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.260
 the thing 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.980
 sloth 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.980
 outside
