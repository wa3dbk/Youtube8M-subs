00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.649
 Today I make delicious caramel 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.649
 Target groups 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.770
 For that I give in a top 150 grams 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.410
 sugar and spread it evenly 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.850
 the floor 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.400
 I now give four tablespoons 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.550
 water and heat everything at medium 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.550
 temperature 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.979
 now everything will be me and then 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.479
 dry crumbly then the sugar begins 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.220
 to caramelize 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 and it means stirring well 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.840
 Be careful that the sugar is not too 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.980
 dark brown but a beautiful 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.980
 light brown golde question gets 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.390
 when you get the color you want 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.119
 has reached 150 milliliters 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.119
 add water and immediately put the lid on it 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.690
 after that is good again and the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:01.570
 temperature is switched down a bit 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:01.570
 So that the syrup can stock up 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.960
 if you have the desired consistency 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.110
 has reached the caramel 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.570
 syrup into small bottles to be careful 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.430
 it is very hot 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.940
 it is important that immediately on the ceiling 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.940
 coming 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 As always you will find the recipe 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.870
 Thank you very much 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.870
