00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.900
 What is the good news of the Bible? 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.539
 on the basis of four short points 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.379
 I explain to you what the bible is about 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:19.630
 god the people of jesus christ as well 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.630
 repentance and faith says 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:29.400
 god the good creator created in the beginning 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.760
 god heaven and earth 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.510
 first mose 1 verse 1 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.359
 Everything started here, the one true one 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.180
 God created the whole universe and 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.660
 everything in it is to its own 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.390
 honor 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.910
 God also created us humans so as 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.220
 a familiar relationship with him 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.180
 and find our greatest happiness in it 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.320
 God to serve him and serve us 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.950
 to please him 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.720
 God is perfectly holy and just 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.250
 Well 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.640
 He loves good and charity 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.040
 mercy and truth and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.729
 abhorred both evil and falsehood 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.400
 blasphemy theft adultery violence 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.400
 night quarrels and much more 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.350
 the human being 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.140
 a sinner 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.979
 If we say we have no sin 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 then we cheat ourselves first 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.210
 John 1 verse 8 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.259
 instead of loving and honoring God 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.749
 respect 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.350
 man returns his creator 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:48.790
 back up and do what god hates by 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 he breaks God's law 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.190
 this is called sinning the bible 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.760
 because God has created us, he will too 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.340
 one day about our lives 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.490
 God sees everything we think 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.140
 or do and sin will not go unpunished 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 to let 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.550
 in the eyes of god everyone is human 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.370
 guilty sinner and his 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.970
 Court judgment is eternal banishment 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.970
 in a terrible place full of torments 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.510
 God's love and the frame not to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.510
 are found 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.140
 Christ the Savior 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.380
 Jesus Christ came to sinners 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.190
 run 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.370
 first timothy 11 15 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.600
 Here comes the good news 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 God is not just the gospel 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.590
 just judge but also fuller 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.620
 love and grace 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.800
 god but his only son jesus 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.680
 christ as human in this world around 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.470
 to save sinners 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.830
 although Jesus lives a completely meaningless life 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.260
 led and no punishment earned 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.330
 he died from love a painful death 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.569
 at the cross 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.599
 so he took on behalf of the just 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.110
 God's punishment is actually upon Him 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.260
 sinners earn Jesus paid with 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.000
 his life for all who are up 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.000
 leave him and your sins from your heart 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 soothe 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:42.910
 repentance and faith turns around and believes 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.490
 the gospel 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.490
 markus chapter 1 vers 15 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.740
 what does all this have to do with them? 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.670
 Jesus did not die the death he is 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.310
 risen and lives alone he has the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.130
 blame forgiveness and eternal 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.630
 to give life 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.870
 God also commands them 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.970
 repent of your sins and 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.510
 Rue, you turn to jesus and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.330
 believe in him 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.940
 that is , they are putting their whole 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.490
 trust that the son of god 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.590
 also paid for their sins 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.920
 pray to jesus today and today 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.560
 confess your guilt 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.380
 ask him for his sins 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.650
 forgives them eternal life and gives 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.540
 giving them strength to live like 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.540
