00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.980
 this video is about my three 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.669
 personal favorite weapons in lightning 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 brigade 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.500
 but before I want to start the video 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.250
 I would like to thank you for this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.509

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.579
 Request the you sent me that you 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.290

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.550
 I would like to have it, too 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 really very blatant I have 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
 somehow this is the first video where 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 i do not all comment on a youtube 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 could answer why so many were 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 and also very complex comments 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.059
 you could not answer so despite 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.409
 thanks to all the people who 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.629
 man account provided 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.980
 I know this help too 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.859
 really appreciate and my account 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.219
 was now eating I play now 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:03.780
 the account of this from a receipt 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.190
 So you can do without, but maybe 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 In any case could pronounce wrong 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.710
 account really really sick 11 kg us 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.510
 2,000,000 concisely and all 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 weapons even brutal winter on cruiser 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 also deny play 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.940
 Many thanks to you for missing me 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.820
 It can really play on the account 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.720
 very very correct from someone and now 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.980
 we sometimes even with my 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 favorite weapon of course is this 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.340
 video as a snapshot so my 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.660
 I'm very much in the mood for the moment 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.560
 expensive and I like the most at the moment 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.270
 games 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.040
 that changes again with time 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.860
 and this video also no weapons 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.540
 review so i will not get the guns 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.100
 data on the weapons data from the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.440
 I will go into the respective weapons 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 Neither are the objective disadvantages 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 from the weapons you present but 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.810
 just my personal opinion 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.740
 and my feelings with these of these 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 share weapons with you 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.280
 and why they mean exactly now 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.710
 are favorite watch and start 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.030
 I want to do with the camp 77 a right 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.080
 really cool beginning at a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.330
 sniper and yes it is one of the few 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.140
 places where you really need skill 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.690
 or 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.160
 with the cbm in my opinion 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 actually the only one where you still 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.110
 really right skill is needed with it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.080
 straight 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.750
 otherwise, almost all were from 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.190
 op then they are also the normal ones 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 make his means score op 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.430
 I have not always been part of it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.409
 another weapon where you just have to 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.300
 skateboard what the special feature of this 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.970
 Weapon celebration is the manual shot 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.240
 system so he goes into the goal shoots 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.970
 out of Innsbruck 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.080
 a new cartridge in the economy reinach 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.530
 bring and then you can again 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
 shooting is definitely very 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.610
 but also getting used to that 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.770
 the mafia makes the skill weapon and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 besides, the weapon is also very nice 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.610
 and to distribute information because it 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.710
 just three times as hard with that 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.090
 an automatic sniper but happy 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.680
 really about a kill yet and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.450
 that's the system thing as well 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.010
 I am actually still happy 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.650
 such weapons on cheese now 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.500
 if i just have no idea 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.480
 rompel in 30 0 travel then jerks with the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.390
 shoulders'm like okay 30.0 itch 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.630
 not a good gameplay was on 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.250
 ass over and in the 12 he makes me 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.360
 in kiel and am happy okay I have 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.160
 won one against one 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.870
 i may be hard to explain though 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 one is happy from the inside out 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.370
 no idea I've killed one now 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.080
 because he has less skills than me and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.540
 it's just so loud 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.580
 I slaughtered 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.350
 the interested in the moment I have a 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.850
 have no emotion at all anymore 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.340
 I is somehow a child so the 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.450
 actually so far so funny what 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.240
 In any case, I still wish 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.080
 it will be about the juice that that 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.220
 generally bit faster will that 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.650
 The weapons you can get faster 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.300
 really full of new energy and join in 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.040
 do not actually weapon because 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.030
 the scope is so damn lame chic 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.040
 and if not a bit faster 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.480
 would have a lot with this weapon 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.410
 tear the gameplay what you stand now 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.170
 is of course struggling with the moment 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.360
 but before that, where I'm at the beginning, but 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.100
 of course, there is also the lok 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.600
 played because it is easy with the track 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.640
 gameplays is easier with this game 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.990
 the camp because almost sometimes from 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.250
 find tune and if you can not 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.320
 then you just found 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.520
 I also have one shaved 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.220
 Little fear that this weapon 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.920
 somehow patched will be changed 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.920
 he does not like normal 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.160
 to patch up weapons as well as such a 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.780
 little op-method yes meter 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.220
 flogged and when it became now 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.750
 also patched lots of weapons 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.050
 the game is still patched 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.500
 So if I do not play there 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.420
 so horny 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.110
 that's why it's my second one 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.139
 I would like that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.009
 Maybe a gun is a gun 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.259
 a bit optimistic but I was 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.060
 anyway and you really need it too 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.530
 technology to really do it 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.770
 master and only then is 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.300
 really okay so what else do i do in the fire 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.729
 Of course, the drive system is him 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.639
 has three shots and that one too 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.319
 abused to deal with him 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.599
 Besides, he was one of my first 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.379
 Weapons you played 0% without them 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.729
 to have borrowed 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.710
 this is of course a syringe effect 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.240
 I also have a lot of games 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.770
 instead of the Kroll spent with the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.020
 met and I know 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.879
 possible in and out of my mind 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.439
 I've got so much with that 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.900
 talk people and so many kills 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.370
 entrained 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.139
 and he just destroys mine 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.449
 hostess if you somehow rule 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.400
 Just any kind of opponent you can 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.169
 just destroy all with this weapon 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.000
 from the castor it is calm 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.409
 with meltdown destroyed with eight 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.259
 just about anything with herbs this weapon 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.680
 just a most brutal dominance 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.210
 A gas caroline is despite this time 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.529
 where I played with him is me 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.699
 somehow not boring so 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.069
 I have left my time in peace 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.300
 now I pulled him wanted me 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.800
 still not boring in the box 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.199
 just extremely tears very clear 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.289
 buy recommendation from me to you my 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.819
 third and last favorite weapon is the 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.650
 Doers in the act so has a mp and 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.900
 no idea if this weapon so celebrate 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.669
 I mean she is not that special 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.710
 better like fanning sng so actually 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.389
 even worse or like the band scene 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.219
 but you probably know it yourself 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.620
 if you play through all the weapons 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.839
 and then everyone has one too 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.370
 has careful and then actually 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.069
 even a relatively good kdh then 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.689
 you hardly think you 're in the mood 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.400
 which op to play and then grab 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.650
 and just go back to this normal one 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.180
 horny in the beginning weapons and the still bock 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.370
 came the skill needs just start 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.389
 meter to normal to gamble and that is 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.819
 just like the trick 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.110
 the boxer extreme is not whether he 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.300
 for and she is not too bad 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.330
 that you could not break anything it is 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.370
 just play perfectly balanced 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.990
 that boxer extremely i think the design 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.120
 I was cool for the reload 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.310
 think that rather shot sounds extremely 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.719
 usual so I'm also totally lay with 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.089
 the waffles and what are still very cool 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.500
 find that scorpion on the magazine 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:40.080
 on what also close to it 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.150
 that the weapon just copied into it 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.250
 was from the original scorpion so 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.960
 as a scorpion on it so this one 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.400
 normal npd is also available in reallife 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.530
 and I would be very nice 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.880
 In any case, what this video me 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.790
 Hope you liked it, you write 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.080

 of course, always difficult three now 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.920
 personally pick 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.690
 I personally vereins loose also 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.790
 still so it is now at the beginning 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.980
 with the gameplay is just one 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.810
 really horny weapon and there is 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.400
 many more the frigate cool find 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.080
 In any case , you write your three am 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.240
 The best three weapons in the com is the 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.350

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.350
 video how three people
