00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.050
 good morning to all and welcome back to mine 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.700
 channel today I would like to talk about one of the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.829
 last palette eyes released by 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.230
 makeup revolution that bears the name of 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.470
 lioni course united is a palette that 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.599
 contains 18 eye shadows and 12 monkeys 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.720
 you are completely mag 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.580
 as always you can find products that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.100
 Colussi goats not on the historian who 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.230
 even now online sending 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.660
 free starting from 30 euros 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.970
 expense as well as on the Spanish site but who in 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.600
 lager this palette comes with this 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.879
 beautiful outer box in then 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.610
 card my graphic work then goes 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.409
 to recall the magic of unicorns and 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.900
 puts it almost immediately gives on 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.809
 back we can find the colors of the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.239
 palettes that the colors are then 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.549
 contained in the palette 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.500
 the real palette is like le 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.439
 other market in russia in this 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 black package in glossy plastic e 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.520
 very solid and compact so thin 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.010
 practice for moving all the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.170
 information is that in rose gold and 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.410
 opening the wall we find the big one 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.540
 mirror on top then i was 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.070
 forgetting the leaflet produces the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 region 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 eye shadows with names all Jews 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.850
 Content windows is double 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.370
 Sponge applicator is therefore ideal 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.100
 to apply the eye shadow limestone to 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.110
 blurring them, however, to see some usefulness 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 surely this was this 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.900
 applicator the pods are practically 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.369
 arranged on two out of three rows we have 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.770
 then the first two rows with i 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 eye shadows and shimmers the first and when 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.860
 the second is clearer with 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.200
 eyeshadows with more intense colors 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.140
 while in the last row with those tones 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.289
 then with the surface in grids 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 obviously the colors mar 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.050
 let's hope we showed them well and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.960
 then this seems there was a cost of 7 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.060
 euros and 99 so people from the first case 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.190
 we are talking about 44 cents 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.010
 eyeshadow and objects as always 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.260
 writers are pigmented foam bili 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.250
 certainly of quality and good cones 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.080
 with beautiful colors 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.269
 I why I wanted to buy it 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.090
 every now and then felt like desire 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.430
 get a little out of the news palettes 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.670
 I certainly liked the combination 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.420
 between colors, however the colors and sim 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.780
 max 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 plus it lets you create make-ups 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.940
 up different from day and evening 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.840
 plus together with tonality 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.570
 particular access such as blue 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.730
 metallic and many of pink ears that 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.070
 then the main reason for the purchase 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.220
 there are also colors and motion is more 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.380
 soft and more classic as numerous of 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.380
 applaud the beloved for example and silver 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.110
 shimmer I have already used two 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.750
 days I used in yesterday's cards 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.850
 and also Saracen so I'm sorry that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.470
 just a really bad day 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.210
 even today how the winter is back 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.350
 presented this make up all on the tones 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.180
 of lilac and purple is really me 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.250
 really liked and that the quality of the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.530
 eye shadows also let's say the yield 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.380
 color on the eyes 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.080
 anyway more than many words I would like 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.030
 just let you see leave room for 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.650
 colors so I go to do slots and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.510
 I return 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.520
 and here I am with these walls of colors 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.270
 contained in the unicost palette the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.540
 nike as usual I want number 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.400
 written the colors and contents because then 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.770
 obviously you see again but then I don't 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.000
 I see more and therefore practically leaving 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:50.170
 from the first row and the palette you can 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.480
 I hope to see a pinkish beige so yes 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.260
 part from the shimmer colors so we have 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.209
 a beautiful rosÃ© in light pink then there is the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.670
 color which is called mary and I go that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.280
 this fantastic golden bronze 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.470
 really very bright then there is the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.010
 unicorn color which is practically one 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.350
 pink lilac than what I used 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.470
 even jumps to in the mccarthy on 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.769
 soft eyelid on the eyelid 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.040
 Mamma Mia 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:23.890
 then there is a dark purple and then a silver 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.870
 with very intense blue undertones that 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.230
 instead the color used in make up 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 of yesterday 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.910
 then with cobalt blue yes 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.639
 the second row starts so we have 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.940
 this metallic cobalt blue 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.790
 then a dark purple blue follows 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.410
 after which we find two shades of green 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.820
 dark really one more beautiful than the other 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.500
 as you can see is that one is 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.090
 practically already but satin and the other is 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.229
 more metallic as an ok shade 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.680
 I would say that I hope you have seen all of them 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.139
 ok colors on this side instead 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.930
 we find the last two at the top 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.639
 practically monkeys and colors are 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.010
 practically spiritual that is 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.010
 practically a very particular violet 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.620
 because as you can see I hope for a subtone 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.750
 gray however it is beautiful place 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.870
 color really the last color instead 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.729
 after the red of purple color is 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.220
 practically a dark brown gray 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.140
 dark that actually is the worst heart 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.780
 the palette because it is poorly attended 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.620
 a little dusty and with glitter then 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.290
 we have 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.750
 I certainly appreciate less 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.669
 now let's say later you see 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.790
 I can do the last six colors 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:49.229
 they are mar colors so below 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.419
 we have a white or pink powder a 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.150
 beautiful color called you nike 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.720
 that we say a twisted stone but ours 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.850
 twisted tortola rosato with a pinch of 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.930
 mom but you know hold the wizard one 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.139
 problem that I see everywhere 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.510
 still beautiful and special but 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.630
 really special then there is a gray 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.400
 dark dove after which we have perhaps 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.470
 one of the most beautiful colors on the palette 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.810
 which is practically called special 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.669
 really especially special ed 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.300
 it's pretty much a fantastic purple 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.110
 orchid 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:26.039
 but really beautiful and then finally 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.930
 we find a black mat 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:33.539
 so now these are practically 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.789
 all the colors that fatigue that I like 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.680
 this palette I have to tell the truth has me 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.260
 really hit the range 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.760
 I really like color 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.560
 how to say a palette that makes come 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.840
 really want to experiment that is 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.270
 is really inspired by this palette 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.400
 stimulates the imagination can be created 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.760
 according to me beautiful make-up 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.250
 yards but they are still buttery 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.099
 soft texture is really in my opinion 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.630
 there are some particular shades 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.460
 when every time I am in 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.310
 the doors to the rim pallets bloom 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.020
 capers 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.510
 I regret a little buying often 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.250
 of the eye shadows symbols and maybe 10 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.810
 euros even more when goats 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.930
 Colussi does not offer us the possibility 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:18.650
 really with 8 euros to buy all 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.750
 together this little of eye shadows and nothing 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.540
 then applied and obviously a big one 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.280
 under and I assure you that lasted all 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.100
 day that does not go in the folds 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.840
 however before closing on the lips 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:36.890
 or the buffalo hue in marx freud in the 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.400
 color 0 72 fans yes fuchsia with this is 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.710
 all 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.180

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.890
