for I thinking again for less now other

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.899 
for I thinking again for less now other
thing<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.270> much<00:01:27.979> but<00:01:28.979> 86<00:01:29.579> defending

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
thing as well that much but 86 defending

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
thing as well that much but 86 defending
84<00:01:30.240> heading<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> 86<00:01:31.500> rated<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.220> he's<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
84 heading is it 86 rated I think he's a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
84 heading is it 86 rated I think he's a
bit<00:01:32.520> overrated<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.840> terms<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.350> kind

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
bit overrated and in terms of like kind

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.980 
bit overrated and in terms of like kind
of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.100> number<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.850> overall<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of the number of for overall I think you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
of the number of for overall I think you
should<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.380> 84<00:01:37.860> since<00:01:38.159> he's<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.460> form

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
should be about an 84 since he's in form

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
should be about an 84 since he's in form
but<00:01:39.240> obviously<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.720> gamestats<00:01:40.170> health<00:01:40.439> might

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
but obviously in gamestats health might

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.840 
but obviously in gamestats health might
as<00:01:40.799> well<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> he's<00:01:41.220> still<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> pace

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
as well and he's still a bit of pace

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.760 
as well and he's still a bit of pace
Panama<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.360> our<00:01:42.479> 75<00:01:42.899> paise<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.200> defenders

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
Panama so our 75 paise for defenders

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.490 
Panama so our 75 paise for defenders
still<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.280> good<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.540> moving<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> left

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
still really good so moving on the left

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.730 
still really good so moving on the left
back<00:01:46.680> again<00:01:47.070> absolute<00:01:47.640> pace<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
back again absolute pace is if see you a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
back again absolute pace is if see you a
thing<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.159> pronounced<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.579> can't<00:01:50.820> say<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
thing as pronounced I can't say at all I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.210 
thing as pronounced I can't say at all I
was<00:01:51.840> pretty<00:01:52.020> completely<00:01:52.710> pronounce<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> wrong

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
was pretty completely pronounce it wrong

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.819 
was pretty completely pronounce it wrong
but<00:01:53.430> 28.5<00:01:54.270> k<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.560> less<00:01:55.710> than

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
but 28.5 k I think it's a bit less than

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
but 28.5 k I think it's a bit less than
that<00:01:55.890> again<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.549> put<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:56.969> quite<00:01:57.210> early

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that again as well put them quite early

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.620 
that again as well put them quite early
and<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.799> 93<00:01:59.280> pace<00:01:59.670> he's<00:02:00.030> only<00:02:00.210> 78

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and but it's with 93 pace he's only 78

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.969 
and but it's with 93 pace he's only 78
rated<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.170> actually<00:02:01.500> brings<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
rated which actually brings the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.520 
rated which actually brings the
defending<00:02:02.399> rating<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.020> 84

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
defending rating down to I think it's 84

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
defending rating down to I think it's 84
it<00:02:04.680> brings<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> down<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.090> quite

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it brings it down to so it's quite

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.670 
it brings it down to so it's quite
respectable<00:02:06.719> defense<00:02:07.079> kind<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.380> thing<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
respectable defense kind of thing if you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.469 
respectable defense kind of thing if you
come<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.039> against<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> game<00:02:09.209> it's
