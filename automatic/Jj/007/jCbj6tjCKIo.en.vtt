hi<00:00:00.210> I'm<00:00:00.510> Russ<00:00:00.750> and<00:00:01.020> today<00:00:01.260> I'm<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.740> show

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hi I'm Russ and today I'm going to show

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.740 
hi I'm Russ and today I'm going to show
you<00:00:01.949> how<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> set<00:00:02.760> fire<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.419> some<00:00:03.929> metal<00:00:04.350> we

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
you how to set fire to some metal we

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.240 
you how to set fire to some metal we
don't<00:00:06.750> normally<00:00:06.870> think<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.350> metal<00:00:07.740> as<00:00:07.980> being

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
don't normally think of metal as being

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.040 
don't normally think of metal as being
flammable<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> if<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.330> try<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.570> set<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> light

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
flammable and if I try and set a light

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.560 
flammable and if I try and set a light
to<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.290> piece<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.650> steel<00:00:10.969> we<00:00:11.969> don't<00:00:12.179> get<00:00:12.360> very

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
to this piece of steel we don't get very

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.390 
to this piece of steel we don't get very
far<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.590> reason<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.340> because

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
far and the reason for this is because

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.970 
far and the reason for this is because
you<00:00:14.790> need<00:00:14.910> three<00:00:15.269> things<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> flame<00:00:16.139> heat

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
you need three things for a flame heat

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.519 
you need three things for a flame heat
fuel<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.789> oxygen<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> known<00:00:19.289> as<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
fuel and oxygen this is known as the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.160 
fuel and oxygen this is known as the
fire<00:00:19.710> triangle<00:00:20.160> our<00:00:20.820> fuel<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.720> iron<00:00:21.900> in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
fire triangle our fuel is the iron in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.929 
fire triangle our fuel is the iron in
our<00:00:22.260> piece<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.619> steel<00:00:22.830> you'll<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.460> seen<00:00:23.670> iron

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
our piece of steel you'll have seen iron

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
our piece of steel you'll have seen iron
burn<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.359> yourself<00:00:24.779> when<00:00:25.199> handling<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
burn for yourself when handling a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
burn for yourself when handling a
sparkler<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.640> got<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> heat<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> match

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
sparkler we got the heat from the match

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.630 
sparkler we got the heat from the match
but<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> iron<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.830> our<00:00:28.920> lump<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.340> steel

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
but the iron in our lump of steel

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120 
but the iron in our lump of steel
doesn't<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.420> enough<00:00:30.779> oxygen<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.710> set<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
doesn't have enough oxygen to set it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.860 
doesn't have enough oxygen to set it
alight<00:00:32.399> adding<00:00:32.969> oxygen<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.360> something<00:00:33.780> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
alight adding oxygen to something is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.660 
alight adding oxygen to something is
also<00:00:34.170> known<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.440> oxidation<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
also known as oxidation but this is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.310 
also known as oxidation but this is
normally<00:00:36.030> something<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.420> try<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> avoid<00:00:37.020> if

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
normally something we try to avoid if

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
normally something we try to avoid if
pure<00:00:37.950> iron<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> left<00:00:38.550> exposed<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
pure iron is left exposed to water and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.190 
pure iron is left exposed to water and
oxygen

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
oxygen

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.590 
oxygen
it<00:00:40.260> forms<00:00:40.710> iron<00:00:41.010> oxide<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.760> known<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.210> rust

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it forms iron oxide also known as rust

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
it forms iron oxide also known as rust
so<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.379> why<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.649> tend<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> paint<00:00:44.160> over

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so this is why we tend to paint over

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
so this is why we tend to paint over
iron<00:00:44.730> bridges<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> iron<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:46.649> lump<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
iron bridges so the iron in our lump of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.040 
iron bridges so the iron in our lump of
steel<00:00:47.340> needs<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.059> exposed<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.629> more<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
steel needs to be exposed to more of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200 
steel needs to be exposed to more of
that<00:00:49.200> oxygen<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.039> instead<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.610> we're

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that oxygen so instead of this we're

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.510 
that oxygen so instead of this we're
going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:52.199> steel<00:00:52.530> warm<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.370> will

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
going to use some steel warm which will

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
going to use some steel warm which will
accelerate<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> burning<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.780> oxidation<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
accelerate the burning and oxidation I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
accelerate the burning and oxidation I
also<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> experiment<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.210> different

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
also want to experiment with a different

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
also want to experiment with a different
form<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> ignition<00:00:58.199> instead<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.190> match

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
form of ignition instead of a match

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
form of ignition instead of a match
we're<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.149> using<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> 9-volt<00:01:00.930> battery

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
we're going to be using a 9-volt battery

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
we're going to be using a 9-volt battery
now<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> reason<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.370> works<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.730> well<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
now the reason this works so well is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719 
now the reason this works so well is
because<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.140> generate<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.769> short<00:01:05.159> circuit

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
because it can generate a short circuit

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
because it can generate a short circuit
when<00:01:05.880> connected<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> steel<00:01:06.900> wall<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> huge

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
when connected to the steel wall a huge

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.980 
when connected to the steel wall a huge
current<00:01:08.369> flows<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> wire<00:01:09.210> meaning

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
current flows through the wire meaning

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
current flows through the wire meaning
it<00:01:10.049> gets<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.549> hot<00:01:11.729> about<00:01:12.360> 700

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it gets really really hot about 700

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
it gets really really hot about 700
degrees<00:01:13.110> Celsius<00:01:14.010> hot<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.790> much<00:01:15.060> hotter

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
degrees Celsius hot which is much hotter

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820 
degrees Celsius hot which is much hotter
than<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.479> match<00:01:15.630> before<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.500> start<00:01:16.710> our

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
than a match before we start our

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
than a match before we start our
experiment<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.490> should<00:01:17.759> stress<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
experiment I should stress that if you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
experiment I should stress that if you
are<00:01:18.630> gonna<00:01:18.810> try<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.350> home<00:01:19.530> please<00:01:19.979> take

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
are gonna try this at home please take

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
are gonna try this at home please take
care<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.580> use<00:01:20.820> common<00:01:21.150> sense<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.900> steel<00:01:22.170> wool

gets very hot and NIMH and spark a
little<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.500> using<00:01:25.619> some<00:01:25.740> eye

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
little so we're gonna be using some eye

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
we'll take our battery and gently rush

00:01:44.820 --> 00:02:13.260 
we'll take our battery and gently rush
it<00:01:45.560> against<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.549> wall
