in<00:00:00.060> my<00:00:00.989> first<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.650> explained<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.250> bit

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
in my first video I explained a bit

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.849 
in my first video I explained a bit
about<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.820> art<00:00:03.060> behaves<00:00:03.419> basically<00:00:04.290> arts

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
about how art behaves basically arts

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.650 
about how art behaves basically arts
hard<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.160> define<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:05.730> there<00:00:05.879> are<00:00:05.970> many<00:00:06.180> varying

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
hard to define so there are many varying

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.870 
hard to define so there are many varying
definitions<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.440> what<00:00:07.620> art<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.700> more

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
definitions of what art is and it's more

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.459 
definitions of what art is and it's more
useful<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.300> look<00:00:09.389> at<00:00:09.540> art<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> context<00:00:10.380> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
useful to look at art in the context of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.770 
useful to look at art in the context of
a<00:00:10.559> discussion<00:00:10.950> called<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.730> discourse<00:00:12.179> then<00:00:12.660> to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
a discussion called a discourse then to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.140 
a discussion called a discourse then to
view<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.049> as<00:00:13.139> good<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.410> bad<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.759> video

view it as good or bad in this video
I'll<00:00:15.389> explain<00:00:15.450> some<00:00:16.020> ideas<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.500> reasons<00:00:16.830> why

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I'll explain some ideas and reasons why

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.630 
I'll explain some ideas and reasons why
confusing<00:00:17.460> things<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.880> this

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
confusing things like this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.970 
confusing things like this
and<00:00:19.960> this<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:22.300> this<00:00:23.300> are<00:00:24.020> consider<00:00:24.439> art<00:00:24.710> and

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
and this and this are consider art and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.950 
and this and this are consider art and
also<00:00:25.640> taking<00:00:25.970> a<00:00:26.060> look<00:00:26.090> at<00:00:26.359> things<00:00:26.509> like<00:00:26.660> this

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
also taking a look at things like this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.749 
also taking a look at things like this
and<00:00:27.759> this<00:00:28.759> and<00:00:29.410> this<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:30.739> why<00:00:31.189> they're<00:00:31.399> not<00:00:31.579> so

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
and this and this and why they're not so

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.869 
and this and this and why they're not so
often<00:00:31.970> found<00:00:32.329> in<00:00:32.509> museums<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:34.190> far<00:00:34.460> I've<00:00:34.610> said

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
often found in museums so far I've said

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.220 
often found in museums so far I've said
that<00:00:35.000> art<00:00:35.149> is<00:00:35.270> this<00:00:35.449> thing<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:35.690> people<00:00:35.839> do

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
that art is this thing that people do

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.979 
that art is this thing that people do
and<00:00:36.739> it<00:00:36.890> is<00:00:37.040> art<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:38.150> not<00:00:38.330> just<00:00:38.390> painting<00:00:38.870> or

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
and it is art is not just painting or

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.069 
and it is art is not just painting or
drawings<00:00:39.379> it<00:00:39.559> can<00:00:39.980> literally<00:00:40.250> be<00:00:40.460> anything

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
drawings it can literally be anything

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.149 
drawings it can literally be anything
usually<00:00:42.079> when<00:00:42.320> looking<00:00:42.620> at<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:42.800> piece<00:00:43.010> of

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
usually when looking at a piece of

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.009 
usually when looking at a piece of
artwork<00:00:43.400> I<00:00:43.699> find<00:00:44.089> that<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.300> most<00:00:44.449> common<00:00:44.900> way

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
artwork I find that the most common way

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.750 
artwork I find that the most common way
people<00:00:45.050> approach<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.739> is<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.159> one<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.430> two<00:00:46.460> ways

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
people approach it is of one of two ways

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.810 
people approach it is of one of two ways
the<00:00:47.510> first<00:00:47.690> being<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.290> it<00:00:48.860> cool<00:00:49.100> does<00:00:49.670> it

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
the first being is it cool does it

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.180 
the first being is it cool does it
appeal<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.239> me<00:00:50.329> this<00:00:50.989> is<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:51.230> hugely<00:00:51.680> important

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
appeal to me this is a hugely important

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.400 
appeal to me this is a hugely important
part<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.640> way<00:00:52.760> art<00:00:52.969> behaves<00:00:53.329> people<00:00:54.230> look

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
part of the way art behaves people look

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.990 
part of the way art behaves people look
at<00:00:54.559> art<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:54.920> will<00:00:55.100> enjoy<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:55.520> for<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.730> way

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
at art and will enjoy it for the way

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.970 
at art and will enjoy it for the way
that<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.329> looks<00:00:56.539> this<00:00:57.050> is<00:00:57.289> called<00:00:57.500> aesthetics

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
that it looks this is called aesthetics

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.920 
that it looks this is called aesthetics
do<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.640> appreciate<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.359> aesthetic<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.840> the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
do you appreciate the aesthetic of the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.619 
do you appreciate the aesthetic of the
work<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:01.309> second<00:01:01.699> reaction<00:01:01.969> is<00:01:02.210> based<00:01:02.480> on

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
work the second reaction is based on

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.270 
work the second reaction is based on
technical<00:01:03.109> skill<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.590> piece<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.039> it

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
technical skill of the piece and it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.669 
technical skill of the piece and it
usually<00:01:04.580> sounds<00:01:04.759> like<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:05.179> wow<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.530> looks

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
usually sounds like this wow that looks

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.340 
usually sounds like this wow that looks
like<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.860> photograph<00:01:07.100> or<00:01:07.700> what's<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.840> could

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
like a photograph or what's this I could

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.219 
like a photograph or what's this I could
do<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:10.149> this<00:01:11.149> reaction<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> bit<00:01:11.929> more

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
do that this reaction is a bit more

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.260 
do that this reaction is a bit more
complex<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.979> incorporates<00:01:13.520> much<00:01:13.850> more<00:01:14.119> than

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
complex and incorporates much more than

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.940 
complex and incorporates much more than
just<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.600> art<00:01:14.780> that's<00:01:14.990> being<00:01:15.170> viewed<00:01:15.470> but

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
just the art that's being viewed but

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.290 
just the art that's being viewed but
let's<00:01:16.130> leave<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.340> example<00:01:16.729> alone<00:01:17.060> for<00:01:17.270> a

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
let's leave that example alone for a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.810 
let's leave that example alone for a
second<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.110> far<00:01:18.410> we<00:01:18.800> know<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.250> art<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.670> this

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
second so far we know that art is this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.490 
second so far we know that art is this
thing<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.060> people<00:01:20.390> do<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:21.320> not

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
thing that people do it's not

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.649 
thing that people do it's not
necessarily<00:01:22.250> visual<00:01:22.640> let<00:01:23.240> me<00:01:23.330> say<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.630> again

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
necessarily visual let me say that again

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.109 
necessarily visual let me say that again
for<00:01:24.020> emphasis<00:01:24.380> art<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.280> not<00:01:25.549> necessarily

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
for emphasis art is not necessarily

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.109 
for emphasis art is not necessarily
visual<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.500> really<00:01:27.979> weird<00:01:28.159> idea<00:01:28.549> how

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
visual this is a really weird idea how

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.600 
visual this is a really weird idea how
is<00:01:29.329> art<00:01:29.570> not<00:01:29.810> visual<00:01:30.229> oh<00:01:30.409> yeah<00:01:30.950> there's<00:01:31.280> dance

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
is art not visual oh yeah there's dance

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.179 
is art not visual oh yeah there's dance
in<00:01:31.939> music<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.570> theater<00:01:33.140> no<00:01:33.680> that's<00:01:33.890> not<00:01:34.070> what

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
in music and theater no that's not what

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:34.569 
in music and theater no that's not what
I<00:01:34.220> mean

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
I mean

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.120 
I mean
I<00:01:34.610> mean<00:01:35.030> visual<00:01:35.360> art<00:01:35.540> painting<00:01:36.350> drawings<00:01:36.979> and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
I mean visual art painting drawings and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.770 
I mean visual art painting drawings and
sculpture<00:01:37.549> are<00:01:37.729> not<00:01:38.000> always<00:01:38.210> concerned<00:01:38.659> with

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
sculpture are not always concerned with

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.840 
sculpture are not always concerned with
visuals<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:39.590> visual<00:01:39.979> art<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.369> not<00:01:40.640> always

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
visuals so visual art is not always

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.450 
visuals so visual art is not always
visual<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.380> most<00:01:42.649> part<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> history

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
visual for the most part of the history

the second most common example of

reactions to art where people say
I<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:34.110> do<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.620> look<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.340> bit

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
I can do that and look at that a bit

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.369 
I can do that and look at that a bit
further<00:02:35.549> since<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.540> know<00:02:36.659> that<00:02:36.689> art<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.110> harder
