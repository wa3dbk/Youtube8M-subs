00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.790
 Hello everyone, I hope you are fine 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.010
 because we have finally arrived 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.470
 the long-awaited warmth which is always 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.269
 inspires me to something new and in 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.850
 this time I decided to transform a little 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.860
 my desktop because I absolutely 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.129
 I can't stand it when I get you a mess 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.340
 going I'd better at least things that would 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.470
 clean but it never goes because 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.600
 that dog nikita pencils erasers 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.399
 some scraps of paper or aps-c 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.409
 we will draw constantly that business is all 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.690
 stored stored in the end yes 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.270
 nowhere to put and I decided to do 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.280
 a couple of handy storage 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.500
 things which will be possible 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.539
 folding my pencils my pens and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.580
 hang jewelry that he, too 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.070
 lying around idle and again all this on 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.899
 I hope you can use this table too. 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.830
 video these ideas may be why 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.830
 let's begin 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.940
 I 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.980
 and so to make this sweet jar 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.770
 i need some jar 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.050
 natural acrylic paint and syringe 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.590
 first of all we mix the desired color 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.590
 paints 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.840
 fence 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.600
 I collect paint syringe and pouring inside 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 cans on the neck so that it is evenly 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 spread out 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.610
 it's so difficult to cover everything up 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.680
 I take a brush and gloss over inside also 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.050
 her but so that divorce did not remain 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.290
 so take a bigger brush 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.010
 paints when everything is completely painted over 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.870
 leave the jar dry with glue pva i 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.510
 I draw a heart on the bank and well 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.510
 I fill up the tin with sequins again for drying 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.820
 Russian 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.730
 when the glue is dry, remove the extra sparkles 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.239
 I usually tie my neck in lace 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.239
 ribbon to make it more beautiful 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.230
 well that's all ready 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.160
 you don't need a batman holder 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.410
 almost nothing I take a very tight piece 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.840
 cardboard draw batman sign 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.840
 you can just circle the printed 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.849
 I cut it 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:55.669
 now just cover with black acrylic 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:57.889
 paint give dry 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.469
 it remains only to attach the sign to the wall 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.580
 and power buttons to help us and fasteners and 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.580
 hooks in one person 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.760
 we make this vase known to all 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:23.040
 from school way we wind air 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.040
 ball of glue 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.150
 the Greeks knew 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.310
 took common 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.380
 he 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.680
 let the threads dry and harden 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.890
 burst the ball and rescue it from these 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.890
 species 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:07.550
 we cut our shape exactly I decided the edges 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.790
 to tie another thread to nothing 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.790
 stuck out 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.980
 Now I take the printed ones with my own 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.960
 handles butterflies cut and glue on the edge 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.170
 vazochki so that she is quite naked not 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.170
 It was 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.879
 then 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.730
 factory 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:10.009
