going to be a little brawl going on and

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.950 
going to be a little brawl going on and
that's<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.340> be<00:00:14.429> Sableye<00:00:14.969> into<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
that's going to be Sableye into the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.310 
that's going to be Sableye into the
event<00:00:16.619> vivillon<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.580> pokeball<00:00:18.090> such<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> cool

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
event vivillon that pokeball such a cool

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
event vivillon that pokeball such a cool
pattern<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.160> leading<00:00:20.699> off<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.060> Toxic

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
pattern so leading off with the Toxic

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.060 
pattern so leading off with the Toxic
that's<00:00:21.750> probably<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.740> best

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's probably going to be your best

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
that's probably going to be your best
bet<00:00:23.250> against<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> vivillon<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.930> it's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
bet against the vivillon because it's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.650 
bet against the vivillon because it's
going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> quiver<00:00:26.250> dance<00:00:26.369> there's<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:27.300> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
going to quiver dance there's like it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.790 
going to quiver dance there's like it's
either<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> try<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> sleep

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
either going to try and put you to sleep

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
either going to try and put you to sleep
or<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.340> try<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> quiver<00:00:29.699> dance<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
or it's going to try to quiver dance and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060 
or it's going to try to quiver dance and
either<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.929> got<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> focus<00:00:31.439> sash<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.949> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
either way it's got a focus sash so it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.380 
either way it's got a focus sash so it's
going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.309> go<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.700> kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> setup<00:00:33.120> and

going to go for some kind of setup and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.290 
going to go for some kind of setup and
that's<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.500> V<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.760> there's<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that's the V on right there so there's a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.709 
that's the V on right there so there's a
setup

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.549 
with that not very effective hit doing
about<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> third<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.690> clean<00:01:03.960> blank<00:01:04.170> cell<00:01:04.350> and

about a third of clean blank cell and

about a third of clean blank cell and
that's<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> switch<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
into Garchomp
now<00:01:09.990> Garchomp<00:01:10.500> comes<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
now Garchomp comes in and going for that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.310 
now Garchomp comes in and going for that
shift<00:01:12.659> gear<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> Klang<00:01:14.100> Klang<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> also

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
shift gear on the Klang Klang so also

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.899 
shift gear on the Klang Klang so also
having<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:16.950> interesting<00:01:17.220> animation

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
having a really interesting animation

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
having a really interesting animation
shift<00:01:18.689> gear<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> very<00:01:19.590> unique<00:01:20.430> very

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
shift gear is a very unique very

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
shift gear is a very unique very
powerful<00:01:21.240> move<00:01:21.390> doubles<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.140> speed<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.740> at

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
powerful move doubles your speed well at

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.960 
powerful move doubles your speed well at
least<00:01:22.890> gives<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.159> plus<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> speed

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
least gives you plus two on the speed

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.789 
least gives you plus two on the speed
and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.600> gives<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.020> plus<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and then gives you plus one to the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.260 
and then gives you plus one to the
attack<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.369> makes<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> very<00:01:26.759> powerful

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
attack so it makes you very powerful

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
attack so it makes you very powerful
afterwards<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> still<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.860> very

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
afterwards and you can still be very

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
afterwards and you can still be very
tanky<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:30.119> gonna<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.450> gear<00:01:30.689> grind<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
tanky that's gonna be gear grind on to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.569 
tanky that's gonna be gear grind on to
the<00:01:31.530> guard<00:01:31.710> shop<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> signature<00:01:32.549> move

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579

there<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> Garchomp<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
there and Garchomp not have to take it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.580 
there and Garchomp not have to take it
out<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.470> Garchomp<00:01:38.100> goes<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> crunch<00:01:39.590> now

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
out but Garchomp goes for the crunch now

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.569 
out but Garchomp goes for the crunch now
there<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> couple<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.280> reasons<00:01:41.369> why

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
there are a couple of reasons why

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
there are a couple of reasons why
Garchomp<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.210> crunch<00:01:42.509> maybe<00:01:42.810> try<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.049> make

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
Garchomp go crunch maybe try to make

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.219 
Garchomp go crunch maybe try to make
like<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> predictive<00:01:43.950> play<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.540> no<00:01:46.079> one

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
like a predictive play because in no one

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
like a predictive play because in no one
in<00:01:46.350> their<00:01:46.500> right<00:01:46.530> mind<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.250> want<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> keep

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
in their right mind would want to keep

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.179 
in their right mind would want to keep
in<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> steel<00:01:48.899> type<00:01:49.079> Pokemon<00:01:49.560> against<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
in a steel type Pokemon against a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
in a steel type Pokemon against a
Garchomp<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.420> overall<00:01:51.689> these<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.380> ended<00:01:52.740> up

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
Garchomp but overall these it ended up

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
Garchomp but overall these it ended up
ended<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.189> paying<00:01:53.399> off<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:54.060> wondering<00:01:54.360> if

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
ended up paying off and I'm wondering if

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.660 
ended up paying off and I'm wondering if
there<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.439> actually<00:01:55.799> enough<00:01:55.950> thick<00:01:56.100> damage

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there was actually enough thick damage

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
there was actually enough thick damage
there<00:01:56.880> from<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> earthquake<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.869> could

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
there from the earthquake this could

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
there from the earthquake this could
have<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.770> defensive<00:01:59.189> investment<00:01:59.729> could

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
have some defensive investment could

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.580 
have some defensive investment could
have<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.750> very<00:02:01.020> strong<00:02:01.229> hit<00:02:01.439> play

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
have like very strong hit play

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.380 
have like very strong hit play
investment<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> there's<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> small<00:02:03.060> chance

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
investment and there's a small chance

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.850 
investment and there's a small chance
that<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.600> could<00:02:03.780> survive<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.380> maybe<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that it could survive that was maybe a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
that it could survive that was maybe a
scarf<00:02:05.670> Garchomp<00:02:06.180> or<00:02:06.329> something

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
scarf Garchomp or something

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
scarf Garchomp or something
so<00:02:07.140> we're<00:02:07.229> gonna<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.560> another<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.580> your

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so we're gonna see another get your

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.460 
so we're gonna see another get your
grind<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.509> time<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> be<00:02:10.200> on

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
grind and this time it's going to be on

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.860 
grind and this time it's going to be on
to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> hair<00:02:10.950> cross<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> as

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to the hair cross and as

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.979 
to the hair cross and as
enough<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.379> get<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.620> ko<00:02:13.360> straight<00:02:14.360> up<00:02:14.629> can't

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
enough to get the ko straight up can't

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.899 
enough to get the ko straight up can't
Oh<00:02:15.170> onto<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.739> heracross<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.819> why

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
Oh onto the heracross and this is why

Oh onto the heracross and this is why
I'm<00:02:16.970> talking<00:02:17.150> about<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.629> you<00:02:18.230> forced<00:02:18.590> out

then you just go for the punish and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.890 
then you just go for the punish and
there's<00:02:22.220> stupid<00:02:23.030> amounts<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.420> damage<00:02:23.569> there

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
there's stupid amounts of damage there

there's stupid amounts of damage there
that<00:02:24.349> are<00:02:24.470> really<00:02:24.560> showing<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.099> this<00:02:25.250> this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
that are really showing that this this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
turn into a legit legit legit sweep

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.860 
turn into a legit legit legit sweep
right<00:02:29.329> here<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.799> oh<00:02:31.099> now<00:02:31.940> we<00:02:32.000> see<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.269> substitute

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
right here so oh now we see a substitute

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.809 
right here so oh now we see a substitute
as<00:02:33.049> well<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:34.250> that's<00:02:34.459> gonna<00:02:34.640> be<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
as well so that's gonna be the

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.430 
as well so that's gonna be the
substitute<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:35.989> gonna<00:02:36.140> be<00:02:36.200> since

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
substitute and that's gonna be since

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.559 
substitute and that's gonna be since
we're<00:02:36.590> going<00:02:36.829> for<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> swords<00:02:37.310> dance<00:02:37.569> good

we're going for the swords dance good
call<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.049> substitute<00:02:39.560> now<00:02:39.890> Scizor<00:02:40.760> has

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
call on that substitute now Scizor has

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.940 
call on that substitute now Scizor has
to<00:02:41.360> break<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.750> then<00:02:42.049> do<00:02:42.170> enough<00:02:42.379> damage<00:02:42.409> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
to break it then do enough damage and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.050 
to break it then do enough damage and
it's<00:02:43.099> played<00:02:43.340> not<00:02:43.459> gonna<00:02:43.610> knock<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.849> out

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
it's played not gonna knock it out

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.619 
it's played not gonna knock it out
anyway<00:02:44.799> cuz<00:02:45.799> steel<00:02:46.160> resists<00:02:46.700> pretty<00:02:47.269> well<00:02:47.450> for

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
anyway cuz steel resists pretty well for

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.210 
anyway cuz steel resists pretty well for
what<00:02:47.780> season's<00:02:48.200> gonna<00:02:48.349> be<00:02:48.470> throwing<00:02:48.829> so

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
what season's gonna be throwing so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.410 
what season's gonna be throwing so
that's<00:02:49.340> gonna<00:02:49.489> be<00:02:49.579> a<00:02:49.609> gear<00:02:49.849> grind<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.269> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that's gonna be a gear grind on the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.000 
that's gonna be a gear grind on the
scizor<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.290> looks<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:51.709> just<00:02:51.769> gear

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
scizor it looks like it's just gear

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.050 
scizor it looks like it's just gear
grind<00:02:52.280> return<00:02:52.640> some<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.359> then<00:02:53.569> return<00:02:54.200> and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
grind return some and then return and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.599 
grind return some and then return and
shift<00:02:56.060> gear<00:02:56.269> too<00:02:56.780> many<00:02:56.959> gears<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.859> that's

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
shift gear too many gears so that's

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.369 
shift gear too many gears so that's
gonna<00:02:58.819> be<00:02:58.940> some<00:02:59.120> decent<00:02:59.420> damage<00:02:59.840> right<00:03:00.170> there

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
gonna be some decent damage right there

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.809 
gonna be some decent damage right there
not<00:03:00.620> enough<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.099> go<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.400> knock<00:03:01.519> out<00:03:01.640> who

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
the life orb that's going to put scizor

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.250 
the life orb that's going to put scizor
any<00:03:11.810> lethal<00:03:12.319> range<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.870> scissors<00:03:14.870> gonna<00:03:15.109> get

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
right there so that's another gear grind

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.009 
right there so that's another gear grind
and<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.340> substitute<00:03:19.880> really<00:03:20.599> paying<00:03:20.870> off

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
and the substitute really paying off

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.629 
and the substitute really paying off
against<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.440> setup<00:03:21.709> Pokemon<00:03:22.099> right<00:03:22.250> there<00:03:22.459> I

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
against the setup Pokemon right there I

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.089 
against the setup Pokemon right there I
do<00:03:22.880> really<00:03:23.569> enjoy<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:24.079> tech<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:24.799> enough

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
do really enjoy the tech and it's enough

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.330 
do really enjoy the tech and it's enough
to<00:03:25.370> pick<00:03:25.639> up<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:26.000> scizor<00:03:26.889> we<00:03:27.889> all<00:03:28.010> know<00:03:28.190> where

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
to pick up the scizor we all know where

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.369 
to pick up the scizor we all know where
this<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:28.519> going<00:03:28.790> guys<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:29.810> needed<00:03:30.139> that

Alakazam<00:03:40.639> and<00:03:40.910> maybe<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:42.199> seems

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
Alakazam and maybe just seems

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.159 
Alakazam and maybe just seems
shenanigans<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:43.639> gear<00:03:43.940> grind<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.690> that's

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
shenanigans so gear grind that's that's

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.390 
shenanigans so gear grind that's that's
also<00:03:45.440> going<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.650> be<00:03:45.739> very<00:03:45.769> strong<00:03:46.220> because

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
also going to be very strong because

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.580 
also going to be very strong because
gear<00:03:47.090> grinds<00:03:47.449> since<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:47.660> hit<00:03:47.750> spice<00:03:48.139> is<00:03:48.349> going

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
gear grinds since I hit spice is going

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.490 
gear grinds since I hit spice is going
to<00:03:48.680> break<00:03:48.859> any<00:03:49.099> focus<00:03:49.549> ash<00:03:49.699> potential<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:50.780> just

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
to break any focus ash potential so just

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.839 
to break any focus ash potential so just
all<00:03:51.739> sorts<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.040> craziness<00:03:52.310> right<00:03:52.519> there<00:03:52.699> now

times it's you sub and it just comes
back<00:04:04.459> even<00:04:04.879> stronger<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:05.329> that's<00:04:05.449> gonna<00:04:05.569> be

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
back even stronger so that's gonna be

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.339 
back even stronger so that's gonna be
another<00:04:05.989> gear<00:04:06.290> grind<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.949> to<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> vivillon

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
another gear grind on to the vivillon

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.809 
another gear grind on to the vivillon
just<00:04:09.349> took<00:04:09.470> one<00:04:09.680> it's<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.370> just<00:04:10.430> needed

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
got the +2 on the attack that would be

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.350 
got the +2 on the attack that would be
just<00:04:20.209> filthy<00:04:21.019> filthy<00:04:21.829> damage<00:04:22.250> right<00:04:22.430> there

air balloon cuddles goes for the return
that<00:04:28.039> way<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> hit<00:04:28.849> is<00:04:29.000> not<00:04:29.300> resisted<00:04:29.870> not

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
that way of the hit is not resisted not

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.260 
that way of the hit is not resisted not
enough<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.830> get<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.069> direct<00:04:31.370> knockout<00:04:31.789> like

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
enough to get the direct knockout like

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.029 
enough to get the direct knockout like
the<00:04:32.360> fire<00:04:32.509> it<00:04:32.750> only<00:04:32.960> has<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.169> wild<00:04:33.500> charge<00:04:33.710> to

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
the fire it only has the wild charge to

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.399 
the fire it only has the wild charge to
use<00:04:34.479> going<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.539> be<00:04:35.599> a<00:04:35.629> solid<00:04:35.870> hit<00:04:36.080> but<00:04:36.229> not

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
use going to be a solid hit but not

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.570 
use going to be a solid hit but not
going<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.710> be<00:04:36.770> enough<00:04:36.919> because<00:04:37.039> Kling<00:04:37.370> Klang

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
going to be enough because Kling Klang

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.670 
going to be enough because Kling Klang
does<00:04:37.849> have<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.210> tankiness<00:04:38.750> recoil<00:04:39.469> damage

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
does have that tankiness recoil damage

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.649 
does have that tankiness recoil damage
and<00:04:40.099> we<00:04:40.370> know<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.849> this<00:04:40.969> is<00:04:41.120> pretty<00:04:41.509> much

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
and we know that this is pretty much

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.140 
and we know that this is pretty much
going<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.650> be<00:04:42.740> over<00:04:43.069> for<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.490> electivire

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
going to be over for the electivire

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.670 
going to be over for the electivire
right<00:04:44.389> here<00:04:44.659> so<00:04:45.139> that's<00:04:45.259> going<00:04:45.469> to<00:04:45.590> be<00:04:45.650> a

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
right here so that's going to be a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.909
