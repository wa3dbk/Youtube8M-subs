unlikely we're in any appreciable way
very<00:01:45.610> cool<00:01:45.850> pivot<00:01:46.180> system<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:46.750> that's<00:01:46.900> kind<00:01:47.050> of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
very cool pivot system so that's kind of

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.330 
very cool pivot system so that's kind of
the<00:01:47.200> heart<00:01:47.320> soul<00:01:47.650> of<00:01:47.800> this<00:01:47.920> knife<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:50.340> it

the heart soul of this knife that is it
is<00:01:51.490> very<00:01:51.790> smooth<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.720> it's<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.440> new<00:01:53.590> blade<00:01:53.860> style

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
is very smooth so it's a new blade style

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.619 

so<00:05:54.930> this<00:05:55.169> has<00:05:55.379> a<00:05:55.409> composite<00:05:56.069> blade<00:05:56.419> with<00:05:57.419> its

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
so this has a composite blade with its

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.999 
so this has a composite blade with its
CPM<00:05:58.379> d2<00:05:58.830> spine<00:05:59.569> CTS<00:06:00.569> 204<00:06:01.110> p<00:06:01.289> for<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:01.650> cutting

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
CPM d2 spine CTS 204 p for the cutting

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.399 
CPM d2 spine CTS 204 p for the cutting
edge<00:06:02.159> we've<00:06:02.939> got<00:06:03.090> carbon<00:06:03.330> fiber<00:06:03.659> inserts<00:06:04.139> and

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
edge we've got carbon fiber inserts and

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.260 
edge we've got carbon fiber inserts and
we've<00:06:05.009> cut<00:06:05.280> out<00:06:05.400> underneath<00:06:05.699> these<00:06:05.939> carbon

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
we've cut out underneath these carbon

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.640 
we've cut out underneath these carbon
fiber<00:06:06.449> inserts<00:06:06.840> so<00:06:07.020> it<00:06:07.110> feels<00:06:07.259> like<00:06:07.469> they're

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
fiber inserts so it feels like they're

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.050 
fiber inserts so it feels like they're
floating<00:06:07.770> in<00:06:08.129> that<00:06:08.219> blade<00:06:08.490> rather<00:06:08.759> than<00:06:08.879> just

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
floating in that blade rather than just

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.899 
floating in that blade rather than just
being<00:06:09.240> inlaid<00:06:09.979> we<00:06:10.979> have<00:06:11.099> a<00:06:11.129> two<00:06:11.310> piece<00:06:11.520> pivot

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
being inlaid we have a two piece pivot

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.059 
being inlaid we have a two piece pivot
so<00:06:12.030> this<00:06:12.180> has<00:06:12.360> a<00:06:12.389> polished<00:06:13.110> washer<00:06:13.680> underneath

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
so this has a polished washer underneath

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.649 
so this has a polished washer underneath
it<00:06:14.219> that<00:06:14.250> fits<00:06:14.520> up<00:06:14.699> inside<00:06:15.030> underneath<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.629> the

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
it that fits up inside underneath of the

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.360 
it that fits up inside underneath of the
head<00:06:15.840> of<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.050> screw<00:06:16.289> so<00:06:16.949> you<00:06:17.009> get<00:06:17.129> this<00:06:17.219> really

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
head of the screw so you get this really

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.510 
head of the screw so you get this really
cool<00:06:17.639> two-tone<00:06:18.120> effect<00:06:18.270> has<00:06:18.689> sparkles<00:06:19.520> with

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520
