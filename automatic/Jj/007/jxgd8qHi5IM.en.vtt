more classrooms here and then it's up in
will<00:03:03.170> stairs<00:03:04.010> for<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.370> side<00:03:04.580> because<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
will stairs for one side because it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.199 
will stairs for one side because it
can't<00:03:06.800> go<00:03:06.920> up<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> top<00:03:07.250> without<00:03:07.580> having

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
can't go up to the top without having

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.180 
can't go up to the top without having
the<00:03:08.300> new<00:03:08.480> set<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.720> stairs<00:03:08.930> for<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.830> buildings

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the new set of stairs for the buildings

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.240 
the new set of stairs for the buildings
because<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:11.000> can't<00:03:11.209> reach<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.620> yeah<00:03:12.830> start

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
because it can't reach so yeah start

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.330 
because it can't reach so yeah start
putting<00:03:13.550> stairs<00:03:13.819> then<00:03:14.950> there's<00:03:15.950> very<00:03:16.100> little

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340

all<00:03:43.450> around<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:43.900> changed<00:03:44.590> some<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.129> up

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
all around here changed some of it up

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.610 
all around here changed some of it up
because<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:46.450> didn't<00:03:46.690> look<00:03:46.750> nice<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.410> probably

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
because it didn't look nice and probably

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.039 
because it didn't look nice and probably
change<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.160> bit<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.730> slopes<00:03:49.599> in<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.930> way

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
change this bit so it slopes in that way

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:58.410 
change this bit so it slopes in that way
as<00:03:50.200> well<00:03:53.909> yeah<00:03:55.290> okay<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.910> thing<00:03:58.090> I'll<00:03:58.209> show

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
as well yeah okay one thing I'll show

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.130 
as well yeah okay one thing I'll show
you<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:59.280> this<00:04:00.280> because<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.299> reasons<00:04:01.480> Omni<00:04:01.959> mod

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
you is this because of reasons Omni mod

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.910 
you is this because of reasons Omni mod
allows<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.310> have<00:04:03.400> teleport<00:04:03.910> things

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
allows you to have teleport things

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.380 
allows you to have teleport things
example<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:06.220> block<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:06.849> you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.060> teleport

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
example in block so you can teleport

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.349 
example in block so you can teleport
around<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.319> so<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.459> decided<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.879> implement<00:04:10.120> if

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
around and so I decided to implement if

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.640 
around and so I decided to implement if
you'd<00:04:10.510> like<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.019> like<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.410> hidden

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
you'd like to have like the hidden

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.830 
you'd like to have like the hidden
staircases<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.310> stuff<00:04:12.579> but<00:04:13.450> i<00:04:13.510> don't<00:04:13.720> know<00:04:13.750> if

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
staircases and stuff but i don't know if

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.119 
staircases and stuff but i don't know if
i'm<00:04:13.930> going<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.109> keep<00:04:14.290> them<00:04:14.440> because<00:04:14.709> like<00:04:14.920> a

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
i'm going to keep them because like a

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.680 
i'm going to keep them because like a
light<00:04:15.579> relief<00:04:15.879> doubt<00:04:16.090> happens<00:04:16.389> on<00:04:16.449> remodeling

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
light relief doubt happens on remodeling

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.920 
light relief doubt happens on remodeling
if<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.079> use<00:04:17.229> them<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:18.299> these<00:04:19.299> aren't<00:04:19.510> finally

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
if you use them and these aren't finally

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.580 
if you use them and these aren't finally
just<00:04:20.139> kind<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.350> thing<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.799> therefore<00:04:21.760> if<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.590> if

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
just kind of thing so therefore if I if

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.350 
just kind of thing so therefore if I if
I<00:04:23.710> walk<00:04:23.949> through<00:04:24.130> here<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.520> get<00:04:25.090> teleported

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
I walk through here I get teleported

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.110 
I walk through here I get teleported
here<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:29.370> I've<00:04:30.370> got<00:04:30.430> another<00:04:30.760> one<00:04:30.910> just<00:04:31.000> to

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
this locate to a coordinate so I step on

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.960 
this locate to a coordinate so I step on
it<00:04:41.680> get<00:04:42.669> up<00:04:42.849> off<00:04:43.030> your<00:04:43.060> heads<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.630> clock<00:04:43.810> tower
