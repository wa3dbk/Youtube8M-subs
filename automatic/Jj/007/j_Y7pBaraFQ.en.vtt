00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.570 
reduce the temperature down so I'm going
to<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> oven<00:01:56.190> straightaway<00:01:58.580> we're

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
to get it in the oven straightaway we're

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.670 
to get it in the oven straightaway we're
now<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.910> five-minute<00:02:00.660> stage<00:02:03.500> we're<00:02:04.500> now

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
now at the five-minute stage we're now

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.920 
now at the five-minute stage we're now
at<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.860> 10-minute<00:02:05.250> stage<00:02:05.880> I've<00:02:06.270> got<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
at the 10-minute stage I've got the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.109 
at the 10-minute stage I've got the
temperature<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.820> 250<00:02:08.820> degrees

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
temperature on about 250 degrees

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.280 
temperature on about 250 degrees
centigrade<00:02:12.830> we're<00:02:13.830> at<00:02:13.950> 15-minute<00:02:14.640> stage<00:02:14.910> now

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
centigrade we're at 15-minute stage now

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.509 
centigrade we're at 15-minute stage now
I'm<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.739> drop<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> temperature<00:02:17.100> a

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
I'm just going to drop the temperature a

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.250 
I'm just going to drop the temperature a
little<00:02:17.700> bit<00:02:17.880> because<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.450> don't<00:02:18.870> want<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
little bit because I don't want it to

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.020 
little bit because I don't want it to
get<00:02:19.410> sort<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.769> black<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> outside<00:02:20.519> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
get sort of black on the outside you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.910 
get sort of black on the outside you
know<00:02:21.120> obviously<00:02:21.390> Brown<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.380> think<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.800> need

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
know obviously Brown so I think I need

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.910 
know obviously Brown so I think I need
to<00:02:23.100> reduce<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.610> down<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.790> moment<00:02:24.420> I'm<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.080> 250

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
to reduce it down a moment I'm at 250

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
to reduce it down a moment I'm at 250
degrees<00:02:25.950> centigrade<00:02:26.940> I'm<00:02:27.360> probably<00:02:27.600> just

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
degrees centigrade I'm probably just

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.410 
degrees centigrade I'm probably just
going<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.080> drop<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.470> down<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:29.209> 230<00:02:30.209> I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
going to drop it down to like 230 I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.370 
going to drop it down to like 230 I
would<00:02:30.690> say<00:02:30.870> 220<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:33.299> then<00:02:33.720> carry<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.079> like

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
would say 220 and and then carry on like

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.920 
would say 220 and and then carry on like
that<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.310> last<00:02:35.370> sort<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.880> 15<00:02:36.000> minutes<00:02:36.540> um

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
that for the last sort of 15 minutes um

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.490 
that for the last sort of 15 minutes um
but<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.769> make<00:02:38.100> sure<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.459> doesn't<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.910> burnt

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
