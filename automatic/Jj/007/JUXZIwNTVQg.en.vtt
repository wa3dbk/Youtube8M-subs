00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you can create a world just like this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
you can create a world just like this
this<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.359> actually<00:00:24.689> new<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.050> me<00:00:25.140> because<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
this is actually new for me because I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
this is actually new for me because I
obviously<00:00:26.130> joined<00:00:26.550> Maya<00:00:26.880> night<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> bit<00:00:27.480> after

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
obviously joined Maya night a bit after

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.390 
obviously joined Maya night a bit after
season<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.199> had<00:00:28.470> already<00:00:28.619> been<00:00:28.949> underway<00:00:29.220> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
season one had already been underway so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.099 
season one had already been underway so
I<00:00:29.580> hadn't<00:00:30.060> actually<00:00:30.210> seen<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> terrain

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
I hadn't actually seen the terrain

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
I hadn't actually seen the terrain
before<00:00:31.349> anything<00:00:32.009> had<00:00:32.130> been<00:00:32.160> developed<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
before anything had been developed on it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 
before anything had been developed on it
so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.690> thought<00:00:34.380> we'd<00:00:34.530> take<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> quick<00:00:35.489> look

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so I thought we'd take a quick look

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.299 
so I thought we'd take a quick look
through<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> relive<00:00:37.110> some<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> memories

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
through it relive some of the memories

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.470 
through it relive some of the memories
and<00:00:38.960> just<00:00:39.960> check<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:40.920> before<00:00:41.550> anything

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and just check it out before anything

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
and just check it out before anything
had<00:00:42.570> been<00:00:42.600> built<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.260> once<00:00:43.800> again<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
had been built so once again this is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180 
had been built so once again this is
this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.750> seed<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this is just the seed like it you put it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
this is just the seed like it you put it
in<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.000> more<00:00:48.180> info<00:00:48.600> are<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.170> more

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
in the the more info are the more
details<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.309> don't<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:51.059> more<00:00:51.329> settings<00:00:51.750> when

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
details I don't know more settings when

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
details I don't know more settings when
you're<00:00:52.379> making<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> new<00:00:52.890> world<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you're making a new world and then it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
gives you the option to put in a seed

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
gives you the option to put in a seed
and<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.980> copy<00:00:56.100> paste<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
value that's in the description and it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
value that's in the description and it
should<00:00:59.520> generate<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.210> world<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
like just doing this floating cliff side

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.920 
like just doing this floating cliff side
over<00:03:03.690> here<00:03:04.700> interesting<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.820> see<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.270> then

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
over here interesting to see and then

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.890 
over here interesting to see and then

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
back into here it was just sort of the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.150 
back into here it was just sort of the
ground<00:03:12.000> was<00:03:12.300> recessed<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.530> arena<00:03:13.770> was<00:03:14.010> in

here and then the path led back into the
priests<00:03:15.990> house<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.620> was<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.890> the

right<00:03:19.709> there<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:21.200> well<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.410> probably<00:03:22.769> got<00:03:23.400> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
right there and well you probably got a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.699 
right there and well you probably got a
pretty<00:03:24.180> good<00:03:24.450> idea<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.110> layout<00:03:25.380> if<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> course

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
pretty good idea the layout if of course

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.680 
pretty good idea the layout if of course
you<00:03:25.950> you'll<00:03:26.400> watch<00:03:26.550> my<00:03:26.850> night<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.269> then<00:03:27.420> we

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
you you'll watch my night and then we

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.750 
you you'll watch my night and then we
can't<00:03:27.900> forget<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.170> North<00:03:28.410> Star<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:29.310> think

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
can't forget the North Star that I think

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.940 
can't forget the North Star that I think
kind<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.420> ended<00:03:30.660> up<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.900> bye-bye<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.650> yeah
