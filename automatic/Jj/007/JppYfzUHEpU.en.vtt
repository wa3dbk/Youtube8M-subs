00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.050 
doesn't owe you see there's consequences
to<00:04:25.380> these<00:04:25.680> actions<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.520> should<00:04:26.700> learn<00:04:26.880> this

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
to these actions you should learn this

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.290 
to these actions you should learn this
from<00:04:27.090> your<00:04:27.390> parents<00:04:28.880> learned<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.180> by

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
from your parents learned that by

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.450 
from your parents learned that by
physics<00:04:30.840> at<00:04:31.020> Target<00:04:31.410> not<00:04:31.770> only<00:04:32.010> at<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.220> ground

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
physics at Target not only at the ground

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.980 
physics at Target not only at the ground
but<00:04:32.820> for<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.120> go<00:04:33.270> all<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.600> way<00:04:33.630> down<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.960> the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
but for it to go all the way down to the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.020 
but for it to go all the way down to the
subway<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.740> was<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.100> very<00:04:35.870> very<00:04:36.870> heavy<00:04:37.230> rain

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
subway that was a very very heavy rain

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.670 
subway that was a very very heavy rain
yeah<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.270> bloom<00:04:39.810> boy<00:04:40.020> think<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.440> parents

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
yeah this bloom boy think the parents

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.350 
yeah this bloom boy think the parents
said<00:04:40.979> listen<00:04:41.190> yeah<00:04:41.490> we<00:04:41.640> did<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.000> were<00:04:42.090> guilty

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
said listen yeah we did it were guilty

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.600 
said listen yeah we did it were guilty
we've<00:04:43.140> thrown<00:04:43.440> up<00:04:43.620> cameras<00:04:44.070> way<00:04:44.220> up<00:04:44.370> in<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
we've thrown up cameras way up in the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.580 
we've thrown up cameras way up in the
sky<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.210> believe<00:04:45.540> through<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.020> daily<00:04:46.440> buzz

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
sky and I believe through a daily buzz

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.560 
sky and I believe through a daily buzz
technology<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.430> go<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.700> them<00:04:47.970> can<00:04:48.479> we

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
technology we can go to them can we

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.440 
technology we can go to them can we
check<00:04:48.750> in<00:04:48.930> with<00:04:48.960> bloom<00:04:49.320> boy<00:04:49.530> right<00:04:49.770> now<00:04:50.450> they

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
check in with bloom boy right now they

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.660 
check in with bloom boy right now they
falcon<00:04:51.960> flying<00:04:52.380> at<00:04:52.680> night<00:04:52.710> apparently

falcon flying at night apparently
oh<00:04:54.860> this<00:04:55.860> oh<00:04:56.100> it's<00:04:56.130> like<00:04:56.580> II<00:04:56.760> okay

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.619 

we<00:05:12.169> didn't<00:05:12.770> see<00:05:12.949> those<00:05:13.129> in<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.550> morning<00:05:13.910> I

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
we didn't see those in the morning I

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.050 
we didn't see those in the morning I
