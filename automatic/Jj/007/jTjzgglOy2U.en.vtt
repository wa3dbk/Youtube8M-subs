it is I guess unfortunately this game
just<00:01:23.260> is<00:01:23.410> not<00:01:23.650> very<00:01:24.250> friendly<00:01:24.610> with<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.180> team

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
most are not elite ness or NHL level we

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.500 
most are not elite ness or NHL level we
are<00:01:56.650> cracking<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.220> lineup<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:58.120> say<00:01:58.300> that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
are cracking the lineup I would say that

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.590 
are cracking the lineup I would say that
playing<00:01:58.780> being<00:01:59.380> about<00:01:59.560> 75<00:02:00.280> overall<00:02:00.910> would<00:02:01.450> be

playing being about 75 overall would be

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.780 
playing being about 75 overall would be
a<00:02:01.630> pretty<00:02:01.990> good<00:02:02.260> AHL<00:02:02.770> player<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.580> think

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
a pretty good AHL player and I think
