00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
go in here after that we've got a little

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
go in here after that we've got a little

now a lot of people when they see the
Creole<00:00:43.140> seasoning<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.280> red

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

pepper<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
pepper but it's just a little bit of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.110 
pepper but it's just a little bit of
cayenne<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:49.469> use<00:00:49.680> half<00:00:49.949> as<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.399> white<00:00:50.789> pepper

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
cayenne we use half as much white pepper

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.720 
cayenne we use half as much white pepper
and<00:00:51.770> that's<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> pepper<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.609> there

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and that's all over the pepper in there

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
and that's all over the pepper in there
next<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:54.809> other<00:00:55.079> seasoning

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649

ingredients

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
ingredients

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330 
ingredients
I<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:57.149> granulated<00:00:58.140> garlic<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.800> opposed<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I like granulated garlic as opposed to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
I like granulated garlic as opposed to
powdered<00:00:59.879> garlic<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> find<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
powdered garlic because I find the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.619 
powdered garlic because I find the
granulated<00:01:02.039> garlic<00:01:02.070> doesn't<00:01:02.789> clump<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.390> much

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
granulated garlic doesn't clump as much

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
granulated garlic doesn't clump as much
it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.470> harder<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> find<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.339> store

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it's a little harder to find in a store

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.980 
it's a little harder to find in a store
but<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.060> look<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.539> you'll<00:01:06.660> be<00:01:06.780> able<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
but if you look for it you'll be able to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.830 
but if you look for it you'll be able to
find<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.399> we<00:01:08.399> also<00:01:08.550> use<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:08.940> little<00:01:09.240> granulated

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
find it we also use a little granulated

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
find it we also use a little granulated
onion<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.960> then<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.440> herbs<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:14.070> like

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
onion and then for the herbs I like

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.309 
onion and then for the herbs I like
oregano<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.929> some<00:01:16.080> dried<00:01:16.259> oregano

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
oregano so we have some dried oregano

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.559 
oregano so we have some dried oregano
and<00:01:17.240> some<00:01:18.240> dried<00:01:18.539> thyme<00:01:18.569> I<00:01:19.289> think<00:01:19.619> those<00:01:19.830> are

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
and some dried thyme I think those are

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.529 
and some dried thyme I think those are
those<00:01:21.569> are<00:01:21.720> relatively<00:01:22.349> mild<00:01:22.800> flavored<00:01:23.539> herbs

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
those are relatively mild flavored herbs

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.419 
those are relatively mild flavored herbs
and<00:01:24.959> they<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.860> great<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.160> just

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
and they they just go great with just

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.309 
and they they just go great with just
about<00:01:26.550> anything<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.209> then<00:01:27.630> finally<00:01:28.050> we<00:01:28.170> have

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
about anything and then finally we have

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.350 
about anything and then finally we have
some<00:01:28.349> paprika<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.459> not<00:01:29.640> using<00:01:29.670> smoked

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
some paprika now I'm not using smoked

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.669 
some paprika now I'm not using smoked
paprika<00:01:30.599> because<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.649> a

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
paprika because this is a

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.279 
paprika because this is a
general-purpose<00:01:32.750> seasoning<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.959> was<00:01:34.110> going

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
general-purpose seasoning if I was going

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.229 
general-purpose seasoning if I was going
to<00:01:34.319> cook<00:01:34.560> something<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:35.099> was<00:01:35.280> smoked<00:01:35.940> then

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:36.239 
to cook something that was smoked then

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.120 
to cook something that was smoked then
maybe<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.569> could<00:01:36.660> add<00:01:36.959> some<00:01:37.170> smoked<00:01:37.440> paprika<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
maybe I could add some smoked paprika to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.699 
maybe I could add some smoked paprika to
it<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.270> um<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.050> now<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.619> the
