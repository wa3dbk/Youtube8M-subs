00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.400 

so<00:00:00.299> now<00:00:00.420> let's<00:00:00.630> have<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.810> look<00:00:00.989> at<00:00:01.110> how<00:00:01.230> this

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
so now let's have a look at how this

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.410 
so now let's have a look at how this
works<00:00:01.650> with<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.040> hex<00:00:02.220> fuzz<00:00:02.460> sound<00:00:05.240> if<00:00:06.240> there's

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
works with the hex fuzz sound if there's

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.419 
works with the hex fuzz sound if there's
the<00:00:06.600> hex<00:00:07.020> fuzz<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> mode<00:00:07.890> switch<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
the hex fuzz have the mode switch in the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.549 
the hex fuzz have the mode switch in the
down<00:00:08.820> position<00:00:08.900> and<00:00:09.900> we're<00:00:10.050> hearing<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> hex

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
down position and we're hearing the hex

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.349 
down position and we're hearing the hex
fuzz<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.980> from<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> G<00:00:11.660> 505<00:00:12.660> guitar<00:00:16.250> now<00:00:17.359> like

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
fuzz out from the G 505 guitar now like

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.960 
fuzz out from the G 505 guitar now like
what<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.050> just<00:00:19.080> did<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> LFO<00:00:20.550> pedal<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
what we just did with the LFO pedal I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.960 
what we just did with the LFO pedal I
can<00:00:21.180> plug<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.859> Yamaha<00:00:23.340> pedal<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
can plug in and this Yamaha pedal and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.990 
can plug in and this Yamaha pedal and
she's<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> jack<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:24.750> marked<00:00:25.109> fuzz<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> all

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
she's a jack that's marked fuzz and all

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.279 
she's a jack that's marked fuzz and all
the<00:00:30.119> way<00:00:30.210> down<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> pedal<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> way

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the way down with the pedal all the way

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.760 
the way down with the pedal all the way
down<00:00:31.470> no<00:00:31.740> difference<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> sound

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.830 

but<00:00:38.770> now<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:38.949> can<00:00:39.190> use<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.520> pedal<00:00:39.879> as<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.360> volume

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
but now I can use the pedal as a volume

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.900 
but now I can use the pedal as a volume
control<00:00:40.960> for<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.379> hex<00:00:41.559> fuzz<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:42.070> that's

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
control for the hex fuzz and that's

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.549 
control for the hex fuzz and that's
really<00:00:43.269> nice<00:00:43.390> if<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.719> have<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:43.989> guitar<00:00:44.140> in

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
really nice if you have the guitar in

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.700 
really nice if you have the guitar in
mode<00:00:45.250> 2<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:46.480> we<00:00:46.510> have<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:46.780> blend<00:00:47.199> of<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.530> hex

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
mode 2 where we have a blend of the hex

00:00:47.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
mode 2 where we have a blend of the hex
fuzz<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.219> guitar<00:00:48.879> synthesizer<00:00:49.390> sound

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.990 

so<00:01:02.170> now<00:01:02.290> we<00:01:02.350> can<00:01:02.650> blend<00:01:02.950> how<00:01:03.280> much<00:01:03.490> hex<00:01:03.760> buzz

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
so now we can blend how much hex buzz

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.400 
so now we can blend how much hex buzz
sound<00:01:04.270> you<00:01:04.510> hear<00:01:04.629> with<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.900> synthesizer

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
sound you hear with the synthesizer

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.350 
sound you hear with the synthesizer
sound<00:01:05.770> which<00:01:05.950> I<00:01:06.160> like<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.670> lot<00:01:06.940> because<00:01:06.970> I've

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
sound which I like a lot because I've

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.390 
sound which I like a lot because I've
always<00:01:07.510> felt<00:01:07.660> that<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.110> hex<00:01:08.290> fuzz<00:01:08.530> sound<00:01:08.830> was

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
always felt that the hex fuzz sound was

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
always felt that the hex fuzz sound was
a<00:01:09.430> little<00:01:09.670> bit<00:01:09.790> too<00:01:09.940> loud<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.330> really

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
a little bit too loud and really

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.630 
a little bit too loud and really
dominated<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.200> synthesizer<00:01:11.680> sound<00:01:12.040> now<00:01:12.520> you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
dominated the synthesizer sound now you

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.370 
dominated the synthesizer sound now you
can<00:01:12.790> get<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:12.940> more<00:01:13.120> pleasing<00:01:13.420> blend<00:01:13.780> between

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
can get a more pleasing blend between

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.530 
can get a more pleasing blend between
the<00:01:14.620> hex<00:01:14.800> fuzz<00:01:15.010> sound<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:16.060> synthesizer

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
the hex fuzz sound and the synthesizer

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.820 
the hex fuzz sound and the synthesizer
sound<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.700> addition<00:01:19.300> we<00:01:19.420> can<00:01:19.450> also<00:01:19.720> use<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
sound in addition we can also use the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.740 
sound in addition we can also use the
hex<00:01:21.010> fuzz<00:01:21.250> jack<00:01:21.520> as<00:01:21.760> a<00:01:22.000> separate<00:01:22.360> hex<00:01:22.570> fuzz

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
hex fuzz jack as a separate hex fuzz

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.480 
hex fuzz jack as a separate hex fuzz
output<00:01:23.200> which<00:01:23.380> was<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.770> course<00:01:23.800> sort<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
output which was of course sort of the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.670 
output which was of course sort of the
original<00:01:24.910> inspiration<00:01:25.420> for<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:25.690> idea<00:01:26.080> and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
original inspiration for this idea and

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.230 
original inspiration for this idea and
I'm<00:01:26.770> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.950> move<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> output<00:01:27.520> Jack<00:01:27.790> right

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
I'm going to move the output Jack right

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.960 
I'm going to move the output Jack right
now<00:01:28.420> from<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.009> synthesizer<00:01:30.009> output<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.880> I'm

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
now from the synthesizer output and I'm

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.510 
now from the synthesizer output and I'm
going<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.180> plug<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.450> into<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.650> hex<00:01:33.310> fuzz

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
going to plug it into the hex fuzz

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.469 
going to plug it into the hex fuzz
output<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.920> one<00:01:36.729> thing<00:01:36.850> that's<00:01:36.910> important<00:01:37.390> to

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
output now one thing that's important to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.450 
output now one thing that's important to
mention<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:37.990> since<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:38.979> a<00:01:39.009> tip<00:01:39.310> ring

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
mention is that since this is a tip ring

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.150 
mention is that since this is a tip ring
sleeve<00:01:39.520> Jack<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.300> I<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.200> ring<00:01:41.470> wired<00:01:41.890> up

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
sleeve Jack and I have the ring wired up

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.270 
sleeve Jack and I have the ring wired up
as<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:44.020> output<00:01:44.530> we're<00:01:44.830> going<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.009> put

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
as the the output we're going to put

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.570 
as the the output we're going to put
this<00:01:45.690> plug<00:01:46.690> into<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.140> hex<00:01:47.890> buzz<00:01:48.130> jack<00:01:48.400> but

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
this plug into the hex buzz jack but

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.680 
this plug into the hex buzz jack but
we're<00:01:48.729> all<00:01:48.790> going<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.090> put<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.330> in<00:01:49.450> until<00:01:49.630> you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
we're all going to put it in until you

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.200 
we're all going to put it in until you
hear<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.960> first<00:01:50.200> click<00:01:50.560> or<00:01:50.860> feel<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.000> first

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
hear the first click or feel the first

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.440 
hear the first click or feel the first
click<00:01:56.040> okay<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.790> not<00:01:57.910> quite<00:01:58.149> all<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.420> way

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
click okay so it's not quite all the way

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.780 
click okay so it's not quite all the way
in<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:58.930> we<00:01:59.800> definitely<00:02:00.220> have<00:02:00.310> hex<00:02:00.580> fuss

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
in and we definitely have hex fuss

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.669 
in and we definitely have hex fuss
because<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.240> hex<00:02:01.420> fuzz<00:02:01.690> sound<00:02:01.960> when<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.500> take

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
because the hex fuzz sound when you take

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.440 
because the hex fuzz sound when you take
it<00:02:02.800> right<00:02:02.979> from<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.220> gr<00:02:03.460> 300<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.030> much<00:02:04.240> louder

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
it right from the gr 300 is much louder

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.610 
it right from the gr 300 is much louder
than<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.840> synthesizer<00:02:05.319> sound<00:02:10.230> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.350> also

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
than the synthesizer sound you can also

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.290 
than the synthesizer sound you can also
hear<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.250> hex<00:02:12.460> FET<00:02:12.640> sound<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> little

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
hear that the hex FET sound is a little

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.390 
hear that the hex FET sound is a little
bit<00:02:13.510> brighter<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:14.709> because<00:02:15.010> it's<00:02:15.190> not

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
bit brighter and that's because it's not

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.970 
bit brighter and that's because it's not

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
going through the 24 DB per octave

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.320 
going through the 24 DB per octave
low-pass<00:02:18.730> filter<00:02:19.209> on<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.709> gr<00:02:21.010> 300<00:02:21.490> which<00:02:21.670> even

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
low-pass filter on the gr 300 which even

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.910 
low-pass filter on the gr 300 which even
when<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.540> have<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> filter<00:02:23.110> wide<00:02:23.290> open<00:02:23.650> which

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
when you have the filter wide open which

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.860 
when you have the filter wide open which
I<00:02:24.069> did<00:02:24.310> still<00:02:24.910> rolls<00:02:25.209> some<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.780> high

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
I did still rolls some of the high

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.180 
I did still rolls some of the high
frequency<00:02:26.350> signal<00:02:26.680> off<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.130> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
frequency signal off so you get a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.870 
frequency signal off so you get a
brighter<00:02:27.490> cleaner<00:02:28.270> hex<00:02:28.569> fuzz<00:02:28.780> sound<00:02:29.880> there's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
brighter cleaner hex fuzz sound there's

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.970 
brighter cleaner hex fuzz sound there's
one<00:02:31.060> more<00:02:31.209> cool<00:02:31.420> thing<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.840> can<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.170> using<00:02:32.770> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
one more cool thing we can do using the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.870 
one more cool thing we can do using the
hex<00:02:33.700> fuzz<00:02:33.970> jack<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.580> use

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
hex fuzz jack and that is we can use

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.090 
hex fuzz jack and that is we can use
this<00:02:37.060> like<00:02:37.330> an<00:02:37.480> effects<00:02:37.840> send<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.620> return

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
this like an effects send and return

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.760 
this like an effects send and return
again<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:40.180> ring<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.140> send<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.620> signal

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
again the ring is to send the signal

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.730 
again the ring is to send the signal
from<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.250> gr<00:02:42.490> 300<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.870> tip<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
from the gr 300 and the tip is the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.550 
from the gr 300 and the tip is the
return<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.870> I'm<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.080> plug<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.410> an

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
return so I'm going to plug in an

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.760 
return so I'm going to plug in an
external<00:02:47.920> course<00:02:48.430> foot<00:02:48.760> pedal<00:02:49.110> I'm<00:02:50.110> actually

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
external course foot pedal I'm actually

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.740 
external course foot pedal I'm actually
using<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.490> VGA<00:02:52.030> t8<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:52.900> I'm<00:02:52.990> using<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.440> not<00:02:53.560> as<00:02:53.830> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
using a VGA t8 but I'm using it not as a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.330 
using a VGA t8 but I'm using it not as a
guitar<00:02:55.750> synthesiser<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.470> just<00:02:56.709> as<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> fancy

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
guitar synthesiser but just as a fancy

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.550 
guitar synthesiser but just as a fancy
effect<00:02:57.760> pedal

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560 

so<00:03:03.560> now<00:03:03.740> we've<00:03:03.950> added<00:03:04.160> chorus<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:05.300> hexa

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
so now we've added chorus to the hexa

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:13.810 
so now we've added chorus to the hexa
sound

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.170 

and<00:03:14.820> here's<00:03:15.540> hex<00:03:15.840> fuzz<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.230> synthesizer

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.210 

synthesizer<00:03:20.180> by<00:03:20.420> itself

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.770 

so<00:03:26.220> that's<00:03:26.430> adding<00:03:26.640> course<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.330> hex<00:03:27.540> fuss

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
so that's adding course to hex fuss

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.930 
so that's adding course to hex fuss
here's<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.230> different<00:03:28.440> effect<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.640> there's<00:03:38.820> an

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
here's a different effect so there's an

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:47.750 
here's a different effect so there's an
Ottawa<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:46.140> again<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.590> can<00:03:46.740> add<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.160> zero

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
Ottawa and again we can add it with zero

00:03:47.760 --> 00:04:01.250 
Ottawa and again we can add it with zero
300<00:03:51.320> gr<00:03:52.320> 300<00:03:52.860> by<00:03:52.980> itself<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.780> again<00:04:00.990> all<00:04:01.140> these

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
300 gr 300 by itself so again all these

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.860 
300 gr 300 by itself so again all these
modifications<00:04:01.620> were<00:04:02.100> made<00:04:02.480> simply<00:04:03.480> by<00:04:03.600> adding

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
modifications were made simply by adding

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.920 
modifications were made simply by adding
to<00:04:04.290> tip<00:04:05.040> ring<00:04:05.190> sleeve<00:04:05.280> insert<00:04:05.880> jacks<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to tip ring sleeve insert jacks to the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.040 
to tip ring sleeve insert jacks to the
gr<00:04:07.380> 300<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.010> then<00:04:08.550> basically<00:04:09.270> breaking<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
gr 300 and then basically breaking the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.320 
gr 300 and then basically breaking the
connections<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.910> ribbon<00:04:12.120> connector

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
connections on the the ribbon connector

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.420 
connections on the the ribbon connector
inside<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.200> gr<00:04:13.440> 300<00:04:13.860> we<00:04:14.010> didn't<00:04:14.190> have<00:04:14.310> to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
inside of the gr 300 we didn't have to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.100 
inside of the gr 300 we didn't have to
make<00:04:14.550> any<00:04:14.730> modifications<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> circuit

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
make any modifications to the circuit

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.250 
make any modifications to the circuit
board<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:17.640> reversible<00:04:18.390> modification<00:04:19.170> you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
board it's reversible modification you

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.530 
board it's reversible modification you
can<00:04:19.290> wire<00:04:19.560> jumpers<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.160> place<00:04:20.340> though<00:04:20.610> we<00:04:21.330> did

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
can wire jumpers in place though we did

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.590 
can wire jumpers in place though we did
elect<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.080> drill<00:04:22.470> two<00:04:23.220> holes<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.880> gr<00:04:24.150> 300

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
elect to drill two holes and the gr 300

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.230 
elect to drill two holes and the gr 300
so<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.830> at<00:04:26.340> least<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.790> case<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.180> a

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
so and at least in this case it's a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.150 
so and at least in this case it's a
permanent<00:04:27.480> modification<00:04:28.290> if<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.800> if<00:04:29.070> you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
permanent modification if you if you

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.530 
permanent modification if you if you
didn't<00:04:29.340> want<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.520> make<00:04:29.610> any<00:04:29.790> modifications<00:04:29.940> to
