00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
shove the entire clip in there and it

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.620

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
while the level is bad boy up so you

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.730

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
anything like that because the thing the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.699 
anything like that because the thing the
truth<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.510> you're<00:04:02.750> not<00:04:02.870> gonna<00:04:03.050> get<00:04:03.230> over<00:04:03.260> 30

pretty hard to do in combat training
it's<00:04:10.640> just<00:04:10.880> not<00:04:11.090> realistic<00:04:11.570> if<00:04:12.470> some<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.709> you

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
it's just not realistic if some of you

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.920 
it's just not realistic if some of you
guys<00:04:12.800> are<00:04:12.920> gonna<00:04:13.160> complain<00:04:13.580> about<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
guys are gonna complain about the this

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.560 
guys are gonna complain about the this
hundred<00:04:15.290> plus<00:04:15.440> with<00:04:15.620> every<00:04:15.860> gun<00:04:16.359> being<00:04:17.359> only

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
hundred plus with every gun being only

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.510 
hundred plus with every gun being only
kill<00:04:17.900> streaks<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.739> remember<00:04:19.070> back<00:04:19.250> in<00:04:19.280> the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
kill streaks just remember back in the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.250 
kill streaks just remember back in the
day<00:04:19.670> when<00:04:19.850> was<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.060> nuke<00:04:20.359> with<00:04:20.540> every<00:04:20.780> gun<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
day when was a nuke with every gun the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.020 
day when was a nuke with every gun the
thing<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.770> get<00:04:21.919> seven<00:04:22.250> kills<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.880> hay

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
thing is you get seven kills and the hay

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.630 
thing is you get seven kills and the hay
would<00:04:23.240> bring<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:23.510> right<00:04:23.690> up<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.990> your<00:04:24.310> nuke<00:04:25.310> so

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
would bring you right up to your nuke so

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.550 
would bring you right up to your nuke so
if<00:04:26.000> you're<00:04:26.150> gonna<00:04:26.270> complain<00:04:26.450> about<00:04:26.600> that

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
if you're gonna complain about that

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.900 
if you're gonna complain about that
you've<00:04:27.740> pretty<00:04:27.980> much<00:04:28.070> always<00:04:28.340> seen<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.820> if

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
you've pretty much always seen it if

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.040 
you've pretty much always seen it if
you've<00:04:29.030> seen<00:04:29.240> anyone<00:04:29.480> do<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.660> hard<00:04:29.840> plus

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
you've seen anyone do the hard plus

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.840 
you've seen anyone do the hard plus
whatever<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.470> mean<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> nuke<00:04:31.310> with<00:04:31.460> every<00:04:31.669> gun

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
whatever I mean the nuke with every gun

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.310 
whatever I mean the nuke with every gun
so<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.180> pretty<00:04:32.360> much<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.660> same<00:04:32.810> basis

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
so it's pretty much the same basis

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.050 
so it's pretty much the same basis
