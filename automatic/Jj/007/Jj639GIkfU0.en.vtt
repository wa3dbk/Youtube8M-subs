I don't really know I'm at the front of
the<00:01:48.210> line<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.780> i'm<00:01:48.900> on<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> closest

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the line right here i'm on the closest

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.749 
the line right here i'm on the closest
to<00:01:49.740> their<00:01:49.890> spawn<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> don't<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
to their spawn so I don't want to

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.640 
to their spawn so I don't want to
advance<00:01:51.000> anymore<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.900> wait<00:01:52.110> until<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
advance anymore so I just wait until the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.670 
advance anymore so I just wait until the
next<00:01:52.829> person<00:01:53.159> pops<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.909> grab<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.509> guy<00:01:54.720> got

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
next person pops out I grab that guy got

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
next person pops out I grab that guy got
that<00:01:55.920> guy<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.280> moved<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that guy I moved back and then kind of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.600 
that guy I moved back and then kind of
get<00:01:58.110> back<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.590> conservative<00:01:59.220> position

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
get back into a conservative position

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
get back into a conservative position
where<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.689> kind<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> figure<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.350> where

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
where I can kind of figure out where

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440 
where I can kind of figure out where
everybody<00:02:01.740> else<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.040> spawning<00:02:02.340> move<00:02:03.180> back

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
everybody else is spawning move back

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.080 
everybody else is spawning move back

and this is a this is kind of a good

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.680 
and this is a this is kind of a good
spot<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:52.989> be<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.440> because<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.880> just<00:02:55.000> it's<00:02:55.450> not

spot to be in because it's just it's not

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.780 
spot to be in because it's just it's not
it's<00:02:55.989> not<00:02:56.110> too<00:02:56.380> obvious<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:57.070> if<00:02:57.280> people<00:02:57.489> look

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
it's not too obvious but if people look

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.140 
it's not too obvious but if people look
down<00:02:58.090> from<00:02:58.630> their<00:02:58.900> spawn<00:02:59.230> point<00:02:59.530> down<00:02:59.739> that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
down from their spawn point down that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.580 
down from their spawn point down that
down<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.600> kind<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.900> Road<00:03:02.140> where<00:03:02.440> the

map<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:07.780> easy<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> kill<00:03:08.410> people<00:03:08.800> if

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
map it's so easy to kill people if

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.740 
map it's so easy to kill people if
they're<00:03:09.070> about<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.550> they're<00:03:10.269> about<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.570> come

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.390 
however so another thing is on this map
it's<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:20.320> generally<00:03:20.769> it's<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.040> easy<00:03:21.250> to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
it's just you generally it's so easy to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.680 
it's just you generally it's so easy to
get<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.519> Nuke<00:03:21.790> if<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.150> get<00:03:22.329> Nick<00:03:22.480> chopper

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
get a Nuke if you get Nick chopper

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.539 
get a Nuke if you get Nick chopper
gunner<00:03:22.989> because<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:23.769> small<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.340> just

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
gunner because it's so small it just
