 the Colombian market derived meat 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.130
 mentioned by dynamisation and growth to be a category that 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.899
 supplies nutrition needs

 ricardo musso highlights how

 the leaders in developing applications and marketing 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.890
 cold meats 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.540
 level that has reached during its 35 years of trajectory achieving a broad 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.190
 coverage of the national territory with this these products 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.560
 protected in its prestigious and recognized brand 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.770
 they reign in buildings 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.490
 'matrix' of important companies in Colombia 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.450
 participates in a special way in food business as

 spicy sweets 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 in this range of important brands as a stamp 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 kunis and since July 2002 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.119
 although these brands maintain their commercial independence 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.780
 your logistic operation 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 was projected towards a new integration approach 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.600
 the traditional logistic model that each company worked was left behind 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.920
 where the production was centralized the plant will be deactivated trevin each fleet 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.240
 of vehicles distributes the products to the different regions of the country 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.320
 routes that were replicated by each company and that required to know 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 ten years later 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.620
 San Salvador 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.740
 and the reality is different 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 Let's look in detail at how the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.350
 they manage their operations and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.340
 and is that the supply chain 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.830
 before the forecast of purchases until the commercial distribution of the four 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.400
 brands 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.790
 the first implication of the creation of distribution centers and the 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.859
 cities of each brand 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.649
 physically separated from their production plants 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:19.369
 which in turn have been buried and specialized by product line 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.279
 looking for greater productive efficiency 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.329
 the decision to purchase raw material 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.819
 soot is centralized from where certified suppliers are verified and 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.359
 sends to the requirements of each plant 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.449
 commercial networks are responsible for sales forecasts starting 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.639
 of which production is planned 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.219
 in the next phase 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.699
 transport management plays a decisive role in the chain of 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:44.609
 supplies 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.719
 after the integration of caracas and the handling of complete laps constitute 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.419
 highly efficient strategies and the reduction of operating costs 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.350
 let's see 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.640
 for the case of Cali there are two routes with which 100% of the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.829
 eps 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.219
 a vehicle leaves with Cádiz and Granada 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.469
 delivering merchandise among them 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.349
 it will mean to take to Barranquilla 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.869
 He remembered the island saona 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.119
 to attract to cali the production of the building floor 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.999
 there is a second route that covers the vital journey 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:20.239
 and why Bogota and Barranquilla attending intermediate cities like 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.739
 bucaramanga and montería 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.369
 through the platform transportation system 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:25.789
 or the so-called cost 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.789
 from bogotá and Barranquilla respectively 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.769
 as a starting point for the implementation of this new approach 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.759
 according to acute 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.530
 in December of 2002 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.680
 the world's first ricardo distribution center 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.599
 the official figure 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.349
 your responsibility 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.620
 be the logistics operator of Tuesday

 means home 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.579
 whose engineering 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.859
 conditions each space according to the requirements demanded by the work that 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.859
 there they develop
