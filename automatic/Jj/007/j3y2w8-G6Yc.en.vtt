00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
edge which allows it to go around the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.469 
edge which allows it to go around the
nail<00:01:15.659> without<00:01:16.229> cutting<00:01:16.710> yourself<00:01:17.150> or<00:01:18.150> your

bit and it worked really well it's a lot

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.900

finer<00:02:34.760> than<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:35.680> carbine<00:02:36.680> bit<00:02:36.950> I'll<00:02:37.670> show<00:02:37.700> you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
finer than my carbine bit I'll show you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.970 
finer than my carbine bit I'll show you
that<00:02:38.180> here<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.870> give<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.140> an<00:02:39.290> idea<00:02:39.410> so

that here just to give you an idea so

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.240 
that here just to give you an idea so
this<00:02:40.220> one<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.570> coarse<00:02:42.110> carbine<00:02:43.070> bit

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
this one here is a coarse carbine bit

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.920 
this one here is a coarse carbine bit
and<00:02:43.460> this<00:02:43.550> one<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.060> more<00:02:44.300> fine<00:02:44.570> which<00:02:44.900> is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and this one here is more fine which is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.720 
and this one here is more fine which is
nice<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:45.860> less<00:02:46.340> good<00:02:46.400> with

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
nice because you have less good with

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
nice because you have less good with
less<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.570> chance<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.050> cutting<00:02:48.380> yourself

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
less of a chance of cutting yourself

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.520 
less of a chance of cutting yourself
with<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.040> one<00:02:49.330> then<00:02:50.330> mine<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.110> then<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
with this one then mine and then the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.530 
with this one then mine and then the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730
