00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
okay so it was able to do a hundred amps

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.469 
okay so it was able to do a hundred amps
for<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> few<00:01:10.320> seconds<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.729> better<00:01:12.210> than

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
for a few seconds which is better than

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
for a few seconds which is better than
I've<00:01:12.690> ever<00:01:12.720> seen<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.500> many<00:01:13.649> other<00:01:13.860> RC

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I've ever seen there are many other RC

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
I've ever seen there are many other RC

71<00:01:30.530> C<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:31.890> highest<00:01:32.160> I've<00:01:32.280> seen<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.540 

let's<00:01:36.509> find<00:01:36.690> them<00:01:36.869> yeah<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.560> riders<00:01:37.950> let<00:01:38.460> me

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
let's find them yeah the riders let me

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:55.309 
let's find them yeah the riders let me
let<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.509> FLIR<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:54.080> hundred<00:01:55.080> for<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
let me get the FLIR on a hundred for a

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.309 
let me get the FLIR on a hundred for a
few<00:01:55.530> seconds<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.190> pretty<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.149> NRC<00:01:57.780> naturally

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
few seconds is pretty good NRC naturally

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.700 
few seconds is pretty good NRC naturally
its<00:01:58.649> battery<00:01:59.009> signal<00:01:59.280> quick
