jeez<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:08.060> see<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.330> like<00:02:08.450> there's<00:02:08.869> a

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
jeez I can see that like there's a

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.540 
jeez I can see that like there's a
little<00:02:09.110> bit<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.410> edgeguarding<00:02:10.100> difference

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550
