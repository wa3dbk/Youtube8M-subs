00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
has started is usually not a good option

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.729 
has started is usually not a good option
since<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> will<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> while<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> mid

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
since it will take a while for the mid

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
since it will take a while for the mid
for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> medications<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.479> an<00:01:06.600> effect

for the medications to have an effect

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
for the medications to have an effect
and<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.590> may<00:01:07.740> end<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:07.920> taking<00:01:07.979> too<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.580> which

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
may not become apparent until many hours

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
may not become apparent until many hours
after<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> procedure<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.900> may<00:01:13.080> already

after the procedure when you may already

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.719 
after the procedure when you may already
be<00:01:13.380> home<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.900> another<00:01:16.710> option<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> local

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
be home so another option is local

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
be home so another option is local
anesthesia<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.270> IV<00:01:18.420> sedation<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.890> case

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
anesthesia with IV sedation in this case

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.030 
anesthesia with IV sedation in this case
an<00:01:20.369> IV<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.850> placed<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.450> vein

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
an IV is placed into your vein

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.200 
an IV is placed into your vein
medication<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.340> given<00:01:23.670> through<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.030> IV

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
medication is then given through your IV

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
medication is then given through your IV
directly<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.409> bloodstream<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
directly into your bloodstream so the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.359 
directly into your bloodstream so the
medication<00:01:26.939> takes<00:01:27.330> effect<00:01:27.659> fairly<00:01:28.049> quickly

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
medication takes effect fairly quickly

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.710 
medication takes effect fairly quickly
now<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> need<00:01:29.790> more<00:01:29.939> medication<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> can

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
now if you need more medication it can

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
now if you need more medication it can
be<00:01:30.930> easily<00:01:31.170> administered<00:01:32.180> now<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> are

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
be easily administered now you are

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
be easily administered now you are
breathing<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.079> your<00:01:34.229> own<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.759> you
