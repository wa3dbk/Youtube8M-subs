00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
been cut and we cut her wing off because

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.090 
been cut and we cut her wing off because
if<00:00:42.519> you<00:00:42.699> cut<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:42.970> on<00:00:43.269> one<00:00:43.570> side<00:00:43.900> they'll<00:00:44.739> tend

and all you want to do is make a bend
large<00:01:52.050> enough<00:01:52.410> that<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.620> can<00:01:52.740> reach<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
large enough that you can reach just

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.690 
large enough that you can reach just
above<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:54.210> shank<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.200> point<00:01:55.860> where<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
above the shank and that point where the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240 
above the shank and that point where the
toes<00:01:56.940> come<00:01:57.270> out<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.690> sort<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.050> bulbous<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.160> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
toes come out is sort of bulbous and it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.680 
toes come out is sort of bulbous and it
gets<00:01:59.400> caught<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.970> there<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.330> they<00:02:00.420> can't

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
gets caught right there and they can't

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.390 
gets caught right there and they can't
move<00:02:00.900> then<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.500> pick<00:02:01.650> them<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.160> it's<00:02:02.370> a

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
move then you can pick them up so it's a

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.710 
move then you can pick them up so it's a
great<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.820> catch<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.660> go

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
great way to catch it so I'm going to go

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:26.780 
great way to catch it so I'm going to go
in<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.900> get<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.170> cold<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:25.670> even<00:02:26.670> with

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
in here and get that cold end even with

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:38.600 
in here and get that cold end even with
this<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.240> not<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.420> easy<00:02:37.190> just<00:02:38.190> don't<00:02:38.400> want

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
this it's not that easy just don't want

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:49.670 
this it's not that easy just don't want
to<00:02:38.670> disturb<00:02:39.000> them

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.140
