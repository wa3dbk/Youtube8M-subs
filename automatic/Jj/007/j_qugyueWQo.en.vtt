your last basket circuit 2010 when Kobe

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.619 
your last basket circuit 2010 when Kobe
would<00:00:05.640> drive<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.089> would<00:00:06.210> catch<00:00:06.420> and

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
would drive and you would catch and

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.150 
would drive and you would catch and
finish<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.049> basket<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.919> key<00:00:08.130> that

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
finish at the basket is the key that

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.280 
finish at the basket is the key that
he's<00:00:09.150> distributing<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.080> kind<00:00:10.260> of

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
he's distributing and it's kind of

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.110 
he's distributing and it's kind of
contagious<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.550> definitely<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.059> think

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
contagious so it's definitely I think

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.209 
contagious so it's definitely I think
it's<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> main<00:00:13.349> keys<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:13.830> not<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
it's one of the main keys if not the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.210 
it's one of the main keys if not the
main<00:00:14.400> key<00:00:14.639> when<00:00:15.630> he<00:00:15.900> distributes<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> ball<00:00:17.070> like

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
main key when he distributes a ball like

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
main key when he distributes a ball like
that<00:00:18.080> guys<00:00:19.080> are<00:00:19.289> aware<00:00:19.859> they<00:00:20.100> ready<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> catch

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
that guys are aware they ready to catch

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
that guys are aware they ready to catch
it<00:00:21.420> then<00:00:21.539> they<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> faith<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.410> they're

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
it then they have the faith that they're

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.189 
it then they have the faith that they're
going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.310> found<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.390> he<00:00:24.990> said

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
going to be found in and he said

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.630 
going to be found in and he said
everybody<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.189> sets<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> great

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
everybody up and just sets a great

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.609 
everybody up and just sets a great
energy<00:00:27.090> offensively<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.960> carries<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.500> on

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
energy offensively that carries on on

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.380 
energy offensively that carries on on
the<00:00:28.680> defensive<00:00:29.039> end<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.300> it's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the defensive end so it's I think it's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.410 
the defensive end so it's I think it's
worked<00:00:30.689> great<00:00:31.529> how<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> key<00:00:32.790> points<00:00:33.149> now

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
worked great how it's the key points now

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
worked great how it's the key points now

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
of balance right now I think the last

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.109 
of balance right now I think the last
two<00:01:48.119> games<00:01:48.500> everybody's<00:01:49.500> around<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.790> double

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
two games everybody's around on double

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
two games everybody's around on double
digits<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.920> rate<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.310> ball<00:01:53.460> movement

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
digits and this rate the ball movement
