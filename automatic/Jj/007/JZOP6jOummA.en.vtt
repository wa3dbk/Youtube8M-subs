Cisco innovations if you go down here

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.519 
Cisco innovations if you go down here
and<00:00:21.810> take<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> look

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and take a look

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.050 
and take a look
Cisco<00:00:23.189> fishing<00:00:23.550> systems<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
Cisco fishing systems this is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.320 
Cisco fishing systems this is
essentially<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.710> three<00:00:26.039> rod<00:00:26.519> holder<00:00:26.939> okay

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
essentially it's a three rod holder okay

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.570 
essentially it's a three rod holder okay
now<00:00:27.660> rod<00:00:28.500> trees<00:00:28.890> there's<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.279> kinds<00:00:29.519> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
now rod trees there's all kinds of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
now rod trees there's all kinds of
different<00:00:29.820> names<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.390> by<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
different names that they go by but the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.840 
different names that they go by but the
neat<00:00:31.470> thing<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.460> pull<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> out

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
neat thing about it is if I pull it out

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
neat thing about it is if I pull it out
right<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:34.140> whole<00:00:34.320> piece<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
right here the whole piece that's just a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
right here the whole piece that's just a
gimbal<00:00:35.940> right<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.719> fits<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.680> inside<00:00:38.129> my

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
gimbal right there fits down inside my

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.299 
gimbal right there fits down inside my
rod<00:00:38.460> holder<00:00:38.820> locks<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.379> essentially

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
rod holder locks down and essentially

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.040 
rod holder locks down and essentially
what<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.550> doing<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.120> instead<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> having<00:00:42.600> one

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
what I'm doing is instead of having one

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.350 
what I'm doing is instead of having one
rod<00:00:43.290> sitting<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> rod<00:00:44.520> tree<00:00:44.820> I've

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
rod sitting here on this rod tree I've

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.740 
rod sitting here on this rod tree I've
got<00:00:45.840> three<00:00:46.140> across<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:47.270> salmon<00:00:48.270> guys<00:00:48.539> have

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
got three across now salmon guys have

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
got three across now salmon guys have
been<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.289> years<00:00:49.440> salmon<00:00:49.920> guys<00:00:50.070> will

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
been on this for years salmon guys will

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
been on this for years salmon guys will
run<00:00:50.430> three<00:00:50.820> five<00:00:51.210> seven<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:52.079> kinds<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> rods

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
run three five seven all kinds of rods

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
run three five seven all kinds of rods
on<00:00:52.860> rod<00:00:53.039> trees<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.329> saltwater

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
on rod trees like this the saltwater

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
on rod trees like this the saltwater
guys<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.590> starting<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.890> catch<00:00:56.070> on

guys it's just starting to catch on

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
guys it's just starting to catch on
because<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> reality<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> for

between seven and sevens fourteen plus
three<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.280> tips<00:02:35.820> my<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.570> lines<00:02:36.870> are<00:02:37.140> 17<00:02:37.650> feet

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
three my tips my down lines are 17 feet

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.100 
three my tips my down lines are 17 feet
apart<00:02:38.190> which<00:02:38.820> means<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.150> could<00:02:39.330> easily<00:02:39.450> run<00:02:39.930> one

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
apart which means I could easily run one

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.680 
apart which means I could easily run one
off<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.620> Center<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.100> here<00:02:41.130> now<00:02:41.580> my<00:02:42.450> fish

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
off this Center right here now my fish

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.320 
off this Center right here now my fish
are<00:02:42.900> 30<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.440> 60<00:02:43.950> 70<00:02:44.280> feet<00:02:44.459> deep<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.030> so

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
are 30 to 60 70 feet deep right now so

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.670 
are 30 to 60 70 feet deep right now so
what<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.570> doing<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.930> I'm<00:02:46.050> running<00:02:46.200> two<00:02:46.500> down

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
what I'm doing is I'm running two down

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.340 
what I'm doing is I'm running two down
rods<00:02:46.980> off<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.820> each<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.300> these<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.320> a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
rods off of each one of these this is a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.350 
rods off of each one of these this is a
flat<00:02:49.650> line<00:02:49.920> that's<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.580> straight<00:02:50.790> back<00:02:51.090> out

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
flat line that's going straight back out

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.330 
flat line that's going straight back out
now<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.410> want<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.130> bit

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
now if I want to get it up a little bit

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.949 
now if I want to get it up a little bit
higher<00:02:53.550> if<00:02:54.000> I'm<00:02:54.180> drifting<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.660> bit

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
higher if I'm drifting a little bit

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.300 
higher if I'm drifting a little bit
slower<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.500> want<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> make<00:02:55.830> sure<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
slower and I want to make sure that it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.040 
slower and I want to make sure that it
stays<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:56.730> away<00:02:56.970> from<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.300> power<00:02:57.480> pole<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.989> my

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
stays out away from my power pole and my

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.990 
stays out away from my power pole and my
motor<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.980> tip<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> vertical

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000

position like that or if I want to set

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.110 
position like that or if I want to set
it<00:03:02.100> down<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.700> want<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> little

bit<00:03:03.390> slower<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.870> want<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> fish<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.500> load

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
bit slower and I want the fish to load

bit slower and I want the fish to load
the<00:03:04.830> rod<00:03:05.010> up<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.280> little<00:03:05.489> bit<00:03:05.610> more<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.420> point

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the rod up a little bit more the point

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.360 
the rod up a little bit more the point
is<00:03:06.989> once<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.560> get<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.830> thing<00:03:07.890> cranked<00:03:08.310> down

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
is once you get this thing cranked down

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.970 
is once you get this thing cranked down
there<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.660> good<00:03:09.870> bit<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> force<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.800> put

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
there is a good bit of force you can put

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.520 
there is a good bit of force you can put
on<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.910> even<00:03:12.060> see<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.630> can<00:03:13.200> shake<00:03:13.410> the

on that you can even see I can shake the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
on that you can even see I can shake the
entire<00:03:13.830> thing<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.459> I'm<00:03:14.940> not<00:03:15.180> slipping<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.550 
here now instead of one rod in my gimbal
I've<00:03:20.100> got<00:03:20.549> three<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.299> rod<00:03:21.450> tree<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:22.200> easy

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
I've got three in a rod tree all easy

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.310 
I've got three in a rod tree all easy
adjustment<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.820> go<00:03:23.940> 360<00:03:24.450> degrees

adjustment I can go 360 degrees

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.110 
adjustment I can go 360 degrees
I<00:03:25.350> can<00:03:25.980> go<00:03:26.100> from<00:03:26.310> vertical<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.760> complete

I can go from vertical to complete

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.300 
I can go from vertical to complete
horizontal<00:03:27.720> they're<00:03:28.410> spread<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.160> where<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
horizontal they're spread out to where I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.100 
horizontal they're spread out to where I

can spread them as far as the rod tips
will<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:33.060> kicker<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.390> since<00:03:34.049> I've<00:03:34.290> got

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
will go and the kicker is since I've got

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.560 
will go and the kicker is since I've got
a<00:03:34.530> small<00:03:34.830> boat<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.280> two<00:03:35.580> rod<00:03:36.180> holders

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
a small boat with two rod holders

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.420 
a small boat with two rod holders
essentially<00:03:37.049> two<00:03:37.200> gimbals<00:03:37.530> I've<00:03:38.100> got<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:38.400> on

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
essentially two gimbals I've got them on

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.880 
essentially two gimbals I've got them on
both<00:03:38.610> sides<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:39.720> if<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.200> stop<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:40.860> for

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
both sides so if you stop and think for

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.350 
both sides so if you stop and think for
a<00:03:41.070> second<00:03:41.459> when<00:03:41.760> you're<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> school<00:03:42.239> of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
a second when you're in a school of

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.150 
a second when you're in a school of
stripers<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.680> catching<00:03:43.860> them<00:03:44.100> as

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
stripers and you're catching them as

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.710 
stripers and you're catching them as
fast<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.640> they'll<00:03:45.060> eat<00:03:45.269> baits

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
fast as they'll eat baits

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.890 
fast as they'll eat baits
now<00:03:46.440> instead<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.890> going<00:03:47.070> from<00:03:47.489> two<00:03:47.970> rods<00:03:48.239> I've

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
now instead of going from two rods I've

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.850 
now instead of going from two rods I've
got<00:03:49.110> six<00:03:49.440> rods

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
got six rods

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.030 
got six rods
so<00:03:50.640> essentially<00:03:51.239> what<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.660> does<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.739> small

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
so essentially what it does the small

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440 
so essentially what it does the small
boat<00:03:53.220> angler<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.790> don't<00:03:54.090> care<00:03:54.209> whether<00:03:54.330> you're

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
boat angler I don't care whether you're

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.030 
boat angler I don't care whether you're

I said that's the three rod tree but
they<00:04:29.340> make<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.550> bunch<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.880> different<00:04:30.180> kinds
