00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
right here this is the board the base in

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.470 
right here this is the board the base in
the<00:00:16.109> tier<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:17.880> essential

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the tier and I have all of my essential

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.230 
the tier and I have all of my essential
pedals<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.080> typically<00:00:19.500> use<00:00:19.789> volume<00:00:20.789> wah

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
pedals that I typically use volume wah

delay<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.350> tuner<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:27.000> had<00:00:27.119> plenty<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.599> room

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
delay and tuner and I had plenty of room

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
delay and tuner and I had plenty of room
for<00:00:27.810> expansion<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.949> were<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.250> move<00:00:29.580> these

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
for expansion if I were to move these

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.269 
for expansion if I were to move these
closer<00:00:30.210> together<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.050> could<00:00:31.320> definitely<00:00:31.830> fit

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
closer together I could definitely fit

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.360 
closer together I could definitely fit
two<00:00:32.700> more<00:00:32.850> petals<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.780> three<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.160> here

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
two more petals here and three here here

two more petals here and three here here
and<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.910> even<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.530> back<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

and here and even one here and back of
the<00:00:37.890> wall<00:00:38.160> pedal<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.820> usually<00:00:39.600> I'd<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
my little power strip which I only use

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.340 
my little power strip which I only use
for<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.310> thing<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.210> still<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.720> nice<00:01:18.900> having

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
for one thing but still it's nice having

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.469 
for one thing but still it's nice having
a<00:01:19.500> strong<00:01:19.860> power<00:01:20.250> cable<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a strong power cable going up to the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.380 
a strong power cable going up to the
wall<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.100> what<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> power<00:01:23.430> strip<00:01:23.759> operates

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
wall and what the power strip operates

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.530 
wall and what the power strip operates
is<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:25.170> Gator<00:01:25.530> power<00:01:25.860> brick<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:26.790> which

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is my Gator power brick right here which

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
is my Gator power brick right here which
powers<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> my<00:01:28.500> pedals<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.820> see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
powers all of my pedals and you can see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.510 
powers all of my pedals and you can see
um<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.259> can't<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.100> both<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
um actually you can't see but both of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.999 
um actually you can't see but both of
these<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.970> velcroed<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.470> they're<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.829> going

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
these are velcroed so they're not going

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
these are velcroed so they're not going
anywhere<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> lift<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> board<00:01:36.540> but

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
anywhere when I lift up the board but

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
anywhere when I lift up the board but
basically<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.579> need<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
basically that's all you really need to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.700 
basically that's all you really need to
keep<00:01:39.270> under<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.720> board<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.259> some<00:01:40.470> power

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
keep under this board just some power

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
keep under this board just some power
and<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> plenty<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.360> room<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and there is plenty of room and I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
and there is plenty of room and I
definitely<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:44.189> room<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.610> expansion<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.869> if

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
definitely have room for expansion so if

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
definitely have room for expansion so if
I<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:46.860> another<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I want to get another one of these I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.450 
I want to get another one of these I
could<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:49.110> yeah<00:01:49.320> that's<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> back<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
could but yeah that's the back of it I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580 
could but yeah that's the back of it I
figured<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.390> may<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:51.720> show<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.259> bag

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
carrying that's how I typically carry it

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.450 
carrying that's how I typically carry it
velcros<00:02:20.210> apart<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.800> open<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.130> up<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
velcros apart and you open it up and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.700

here<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.540> go<00:02:23.690> nothing<00:02:24.290> special<00:02:24.590> inside<00:02:25.130> it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710

here you go nothing special inside it
that's<00:02:27.710> all<00:02:27.890> really<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.280> bag<00:02:28.490> is<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.510> quite

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
that's all really the bag is but quite

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.440 
that's all really the bag is but quite
honestly<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.190> bag<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.490> too<00:02:32.030> big<00:02:32.180> for

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
honestly I think this bag is too big for

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.110 
honestly I think this bag is too big for
the<00:02:32.750> board<00:02:33.020> because<00:02:33.710> when<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.070> carry<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the board because when I carry it to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.090 
the board because when I carry it to
gigs<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.660> stuff<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.200> feel<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.860> board

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
gigs and stuff I feel the board

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.060 
gigs and stuff I feel the board
literally<00:02:37.670> sliding<00:02:38.300> around<00:02:38.600> inside<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.530> I

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
literally sliding around inside it and I

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.740 
literally sliding around inside it and I
don't<00:02:40.670> know<00:02:40.850> i<00:02:40.880> think<00:02:41.000> they<00:02:41.270> should<00:02:41.450> have<00:02:41.540> made

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
don't know i think they should have made

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.050 
don't know i think they should have made
this<00:02:41.900> bag<00:02:42.110> just<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.530> bit<00:02:42.770> smaller<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.850> few

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
this bag just a bit smaller just a few

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.510 
this bag just a bit smaller just a few
inches<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:45.260> yeah<00:02:45.650> nothing<00:02:46.130> wrong<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.490> it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
inches but yeah nothing wrong with it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.730 
inches but yeah nothing wrong with it
it's<00:02:47.270> pretty<00:02:47.390> nice<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:48.050> sturdy<00:02:48.380> enough<00:02:48.500> for

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
it's pretty nice it's sturdy enough for

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.100 
it's pretty nice it's sturdy enough for
what<00:02:49.040> i<00:02:49.070> need<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.330> all<00:02:50.510> know<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.780> this

what i need so we all know that this
board<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.740> very<00:02:51.920> like<00:02:52.550> that's<00:02:52.850> probably<00:02:53.300> the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
board is very like that's probably the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.090

reason you're getting it because it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.790 
reason you're getting it because it
weighs<00:02:55.370> very<00:02:56.240> little<00:02:56.660> probably<00:02:57.140> about<00:02:57.290> 5

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
weighs very little probably about 5

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.670

pounds<00:02:58.100> without<00:02:58.460> all<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.940> pedals<00:02:59.300> but<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.500> it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
pounds without all the pedals but is it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.440 
pounds without all the pedals but is it
really<00:03:00.830> sturdy<00:03:01.430> well<00:03:02.390> take<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:02.990> look<00:03:03.290> when<00:03:03.470> I

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
you can see that this board feels a

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.180 
you can see that this board feels a
little<00:03:10.940> flimsy<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.660> does<00:03:11.840> flex<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.410> little<00:03:12.530> that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
little flimsy it does flex a little that

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.550 
little flimsy it does flex a little that
they<00:03:13.370> do<00:03:13.430> advertise<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.810> flex<00:03:15.110> makes<00:03:15.380> it

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
they do advertise that the flex makes it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.850 
they do advertise that the flex makes it
stronger<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.630> I'm<00:03:17.630> honestly<00:03:18.290> I'm<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> big

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700

of those people who literally stomps on
your<00:03:42.260> pedals<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.890> don't<00:03:43.880> think<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.300> is

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
your pedals I don't think this is

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.050 
your pedals I don't think this is
exactly<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.260> board<00:03:45.500> for<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.860> because<00:03:46.700> this

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
exactly the board for you because this

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.449 
exactly the board for you because this
board<00:03:47.390> is<00:03:47.750> sturdy<00:03:48.380> enough<00:03:48.470> for<00:03:48.739> what<00:03:49.040> i<00:03:49.070> needed

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
board is sturdy enough for what i needed

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.940 
board is sturdy enough for what i needed
to<00:03:49.610> do<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.600> it's<00:03:50.900> just<00:03:51.110> not<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.470> strongest

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
to do but it's just not the strongest

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.670 
to do but it's just not the strongest
board<00:03:52.760> i've<00:03:52.940> ever<00:03:53.150> encountered<00:03:53.470> but<00:03:54.470> then

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
board i've ever encountered but then

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.490 
board i've ever encountered but then
again<00:03:54.830> that's<00:03:55.010> why<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:55.790> light<00:03:56.500> so

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
again that's why it's so light so

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.370 
again that's why it's so light so
overall<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.580> board<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.420> pedals<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.200> power

like<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.130> have<00:04:10.250> pedals<00:04:10.670> but<00:04:11.420> why<00:04:11.750> would<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:11.959> get

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
like to have pedals but why would I get

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.010 
like to have pedals but why would I get
a<00:04:12.260> board<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.950> was<00:04:13.520> 20<00:04:13.940> pounds<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.450> begin<00:04:14.810> with

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
a board that was 20 pounds to begin with

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.120 
a board that was 20 pounds to begin with
maybe<00:04:15.530> not<00:04:15.709> 20<00:04:16.130> pounds<00:04:16.549> but<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.270> ohm<00:04:17.390> 10<00:04:17.690> or

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
maybe not 20 pounds but the ohm 10 or

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.449 
maybe not 20 pounds but the ohm 10 or
Dean<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.150> would<00:04:19.600> just<00:04:19.630> be<00:04:20.190> extremely<00:04:21.190> heavy

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
Dean it would just be extremely heavy

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.390 
Dean it would just be extremely heavy
having<00:04:22.120> all<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.720> stuff<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.010> reason<00:04:24.040> I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
having all of that stuff so the reason I

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.130 
having all of that stuff so the reason I
got<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:24.820> pedal<00:04:25.240> board<00:04:25.450> was<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.050> could

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
got this pedal board was so I could

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.040 
got this pedal board was so I could
lighten<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.830> load<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.430> my<00:04:28.180> equipment<00:04:28.660> and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
lighten the load of my equipment and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.520 
lighten the load of my equipment and
this<00:04:29.830> did<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.160> very<00:04:30.730> good<00:04:30.880> job<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.750> I

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
this did a very good job of it and I

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.200 
this did a very good job of it and I
would<00:04:32.710> definitely<00:04:32.890> recommend<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.700> board<00:04:34.060> to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
would definitely recommend this board to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.390 
would definitely recommend this board to
anybody<00:04:34.930> else<00:04:35.170> who<00:04:35.410> would<00:04:35.500> be<00:04:35.680> interested<00:04:35.920> in

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
anybody else who would be interested in

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.490 
anybody else who would be interested in
lightening<00:04:36.820> their<00:04:37.000> load<00:04:37.240> unless<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.470> course

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
lightening their load unless of course

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.100 
lightening their load unless of course
like<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:39.070> said<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.820> really<00:04:40.150> abuse<00:04:40.600> your<00:04:40.780> pedals

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
like I said you really abuse your pedals

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.290 
like I said you really abuse your pedals
and<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.410> really<00:04:41.830> love<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.220> stop<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.850> jump<00:04:43.120> all

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
and you really love to stop and jump all

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.450 
and you really love to stop and jump all
over<00:04:43.330> them<00:04:43.840> then<00:04:44.500> you'd<00:04:44.860> probably<00:04:45.160> want<00:04:45.400> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
over them then you'd probably want to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.580 
over them then you'd probably want to
get<00:04:45.580> something<00:04:45.820> heavier<00:04:46.390> but<00:04:46.870> overall<00:04:47.170> I'm

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
get something heavier but overall I'm

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.060 
get something heavier but overall I'm
pretty<00:04:48.040> happy<00:04:48.370> with<00:04:48.520> this<00:04:48.760> for
