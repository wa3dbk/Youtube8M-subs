00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.980
 this video is about how to be 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.990
 prevents injuries and that it went 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.759
 Unfortunately, I was like that again and again 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.540
 partially hurt oneself 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.880
 violations 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 attracted over half a year and that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 the problem is you just can not 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.210
 Full throttle can not be effective 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.880
 build muscle and that's natural 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.260
 a big problem if you are regular 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 wants to do sport 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.510
 lowers the motivation and I intend to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.880
 recently a study belongs to the very 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.399
 interesting and indeed were in america 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 So study members in the gym 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.480
 compared with people who do not sport 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.360
 operate 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 the only thing you wanted to find out 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.489
 The whole thing was from the fitness industry 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.160
 pushed something you wanted to prove that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.440
 people in the gym less 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.230
 back pain less problems too 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.480
 can complain in truth came - 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.280
 On the contrary, this was out 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 never study to the big public 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.760
 that means it's interesting here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.810
 is that people in the gym more often 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.490
 back problems have but also 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.860
 shoulder problems and knee problems as 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 People who do not do sports are 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.299
 a sad message 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.880
 and that's why I have five plus one 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.430
 important point summarized the you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.659
 help because there is a risk of injury 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.979
 to minimize what you possible 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.479
 long-term training without any 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.909
 damage 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.270
 the first point may be 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.890
 sound funny to you but if 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.740
 I will explain in you he is quite 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.320
 give meaning and point one is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.409
 if you have low self-esteem 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 what can happen then if you as 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.909
 Training beginner a low 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.320
 Self-confidence then you become 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.220
 try at the beginning of the training time 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.710
 weight as fast as possible 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 try to increase as fast as possible 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.000
 to show others maybe in 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 your eyes are idiots or as well 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.250
 always 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 and you increase his weight prevails 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.230
 The danger here, of course, depending 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.880
 higher your weight than you 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.460
 beginners then of course it is synonymous 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.620
 fast on the kind of execution if the 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.190
 is unclean then can injury 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.340
 arise 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.720
 My tip is ignoring what's outside 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 It only happens around concentrates 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.910
 to your own training 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 putting in the earplugs takes the music 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.540
 you like and concentrate only 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.110
 on you and not on his environment 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.900
 then you have an important point because 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.080
 this point low self-esteem 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.239
 As a rule, everyone has to struggle with that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.190
 who starts in the gym because he has 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.500
 A new environment usually lasts 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.540
 this process between months and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.459
 some also need a lot 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.010
 longer because they just prove to everyone 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.959
 they want to be big and strong and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.940
 as many weights also create 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.280
 if the execution has to suffer 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.920
 point number two and also an important one 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.959
 The reason for the risk of injury is that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 only single muscle parts trained 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.550
 and not the entire body 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.570
 and the body is as strong as that 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.700
 weakest limb 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.860
 I can give an example when 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.010
 bank press while bank pressing do you need 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.180
 Of course everyone knows a breast muscle 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.280
 who has some power you need that 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.380
 Triceps you need the front shoulder 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.760
 because only in these areas little power 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430
 you will notice there is also 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.350
 relatively few what many but not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.630
 know there are also stabilizing 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.940
 muscle for example trapezoid muscle and it 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.030
 are antagonists so opponent that 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.470
 If I put the weight up 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.959
 move or whatever you need 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.709
 I also support the muscles in that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 the case because it's the biceps 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.030
 back muscle and it is also the posterior 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.060
 shoulder muscle that is all 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.310
 games needed at the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.019
 bench press a clean execution too 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.870
 start and if i just for example 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.160
 consciously trained or just biceps and 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.040
 but do not put anyone in training 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.690
 then one of the balloons can happen and 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.530
 then there may be problems in 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.480
 I can give the shoulder 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.880
 get shoulder pain and so on 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.100
 when I stop here very important 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.700
 any 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.660
 To make pumper exercises became only two 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.820
 three times a week to the gym 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.709
 it's only about your chest in a poor 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 To enlarge that needs everything 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.140
 overall concept and when you are training 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.460
 then you also reduce the risk 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.770
 not to hurt 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.910
 Number three is lacking 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.520
 concentration 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.790
 there are in my eyes where I absolutely 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.130
 180 fr is when someone in the gym 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.660
 and handy while doing so and during the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.150
 training in the breaks again and again 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.240
 phoned because it is somehow with me 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.190
 high there I have to control myself 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.950
 I honestly say because I know 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.180
 this person calls and calls 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.680
 thinking all the time just because can 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.700
 you call what can you do 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.100
 how can you relax during the break 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.780
 distract you then they go to 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.970
 Training partners are still distracting and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.160
 best still during an exercise with 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.200
 talk to the training partner what happened 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.500
 quite simply you do not focus 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.370
 more 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.710
 you might look 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.990
 Training partner does the exercise 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.300
 Much forgave here 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.740
 or you can also do the exercises wrong 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.380
 you do not concentrate anymore 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.670
 on the muscles that are trained and 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.640
 then it can be very fast too 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.950
 injuries lead to my tip 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.810
 during the exercises the training partners 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.730
 or the training colleagues easy 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.530
 say hey if you're here then you can 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.170
 you help me otherwise i have to 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.620
 Now focus briefly and on each 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.200
 case 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.880
 Please no mobile with in the gym 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.320
 take because there you have to 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.450
 concentrate if you do not 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.490
 you can concentrate very much 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.980
 hurt so quickly i have the video 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.900
 now have noticed finish it takes 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.300
 but yet a little longer something 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.080
 become more detailed and therefore 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.730
 I make a second part out of that 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.230
 the concentration of each person 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.520
 I can not wait, I hope it can 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.170
 So if you understand the video 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.030
 I would be pleased then 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.920
