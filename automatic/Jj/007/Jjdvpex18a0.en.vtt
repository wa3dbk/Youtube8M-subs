00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.850
 besides these news that I have 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 have added new ones 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 news regarding sounds so 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 I was reading on the moya page 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.869
 have confirmed some sound changes and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.970
 well I will teach them in this video 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.380
 those sound changes the first change 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.119
 of sound they have made is related 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.430
 with bats and well now they do 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.790
 like a noise and they make as if they were 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.780
 catching like the birds as you see day 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.850
 day 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.259
 there is the sound and like when 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 we attack also does it let's see if 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.470
 he managed to give him a mother heap 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.310
 mine but here 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.930
 it has not been my mother I come here 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.000
 is how you see they have put that sound 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.650
 before I had no sound and well we go with 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.240
 the next sound the next change 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.040
 they are children who have done with respect 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 the anvil field in Spanish already has the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.640
 name in Spanish as you see and good 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.590
 when we put it more a grace now 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.270
 previously he had no sound is enough 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.560
 curious sedena like iron and also 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.570
 when we work with him too 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 will change it will make a sound for example 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.430
 I'll change the name I'll put 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.170
 Take for example sonar like this 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.329
 as if we were forging the weapon 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.980
 performing the above the stone by 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.120
 so to say it as real life a 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.650
 quite curious the sound I like 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.120
 quite and we go with the next sound 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.739
 the next sound change they have 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.870
 performed with respect to the good widder 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.750
 before I had no sound does not perform any 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.739
 sound and now when we attack as you see 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.650
 it makes a strange noise as if it had 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.959
 pissed off my mother there is that too 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.189
 there he is waiting for a scream too and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.019
 now also when you have these heads 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.519
 which are the bombs that he throws is good 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.500
 it's a sound too to see if there 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.450
 is the sound like a chip like the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.950
 wind so to speak now it seems 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
 quite curious also this sound and 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.829
 let's see next sound change and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.930
 good guys the last change that 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.760
 we realize regarding sounds is in the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.680
 well and it 's related to the dragon and the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.329
 three listening have put sound 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.099
 now it roars and when we attack it they are 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.560
 strange noise is pretty cool like 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.040
 you see there it sounds like we give it a 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.959
 strange and they have worked hard enough 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.459
 sounds and I like them a lot as you see 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.819
 there is the sound also the wings sound 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.380
 when it flutters and well this is all 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.200
