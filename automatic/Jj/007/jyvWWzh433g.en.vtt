00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.260
 and hello everyone with you again i'm nix and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.680
 today in my video tutorial we will look at 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 such 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.860
 such a mechanism as a mechanical fireplace and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.610
 so actually how it works we press 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.560
 on the lever 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.919
 he lights us now push in 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.940
 different so let's get down to building 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.850
 for starters the devil is such a foundation 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.490
 here we break four blocks ahead 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 then here on the third block we put 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.430
 sticky plunger then hell stone on 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 sticky plunger and we put the dispenser in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.390
 preloading it fiery 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 balls 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.490
 so it depends on where you have the lever 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 I will be holding a chain here 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:06.900
 Redstone and so here it does not work 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.299
 it means we clamp shift and we have a piece 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.960
 redstone is put on the distributor if you 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.549
 playing mikroft not on version 152 means 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 you can put it this way 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.899
 here you click on this block of red dust 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.939
 you put the dust and so on here 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.710
 Here, too, put one polinku get 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.390
 and again hold down shift if you 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.079
 Minecraft version 1 5 2 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.560
 and if not then here so now I 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.560
 I'll show you how 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.360
 so here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.640
 so what happened here we remove so 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 In principle, our scheme is already ready. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.680
 check out so so we have a little crooked 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.560
 shoot from our decorate as it should 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.710
 so basically everything that's all our fireplace 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.080
 ready you can delete 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.050
 decorate the lattice well beyond you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.440
 as already fantasy enough and that's basically 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.150
