00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.200
 water wagon 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.850
 water 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
 and with that water we can in everyone 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.039
 case where there is no water 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 is available 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.479
 I have to bring an equal water to one 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.399

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.420
 well it the vehicle still has a few 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.880
 options 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.440
 for example, we can if there is one 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.420
 road surface cleaning must then take place 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.340

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.869

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.330
 Spain 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.700

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.739

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.959

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.180
 commemoration is for say so 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.570
 and what do you have for this opportunity 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.910
 means we don't have a number 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.040
 started a new one years ago 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.410

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.820
 college of the company council 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.680
 talk we then need the consent of 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.960

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.190
 cost before making decisions then to 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.810

 make cutlery and things like that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.360
