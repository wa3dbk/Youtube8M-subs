the bowling ball which creates access

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
could be a bowler who just puts their

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.760 
could be a bowler who just puts their
hands<00:01:19.660> slightly<00:01:19.930> on<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.140> side<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.590> ball

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
hands slightly on the side of the ball

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.560 
hands slightly on the side of the ball
maybe<00:01:21.250> not<00:01:21.520> completely<00:01:21.640> underneath<00:01:22.420> it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
maybe not completely underneath it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.330 
maybe not completely underneath it
behind<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.410> make<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.710> rolled<00:01:23.890> completely

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
behind it to make it rolled completely

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.420 
behind it to make it rolled completely
forward<00:01:25.210> but<00:01:25.810> have<00:01:25.960> just<00:01:25.990> modest<00:01:26.620> access<00:01:27.190> tilt

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
forward but have just modest access tilt

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.000 
forward but have just modest access tilt
and<00:01:27.610> doesn't<00:01:28.210> rotate<00:01:28.360> their<00:01:29.290> hand<00:01:29.560> very<00:01:29.770> much

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
and doesn't rotate their hand very much

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.180 
and doesn't rotate their hand very much
when<00:01:30.190> they<00:01:30.280> deliver<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.730> ball<00:01:30.940> has<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.390> very

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
when they deliver the ball has a very

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.860 
when they deliver the ball has a very
slight<00:01:33.190> finger<00:01:33.790> action<00:01:33.970> on<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.420> bowling<00:01:34.600> ball

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
slight finger action on the bowling ball

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.330 
slight finger action on the bowling ball
so<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.140> ball<00:01:35.290> goes<00:01:35.320> down<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> lane<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:36.070> has

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
so the ball goes down the lane and has

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.580 
so the ball goes down the lane and has
just<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.640> modest<00:01:37.030> hook<00:01:37.630> motion<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.320> it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
just a modest hook motion to it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.410 
just a modest hook motion to it
that's<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.250> stroker<00:01:39.580> it's<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:40.000> very<00:01:40.210> good

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
that's a stroker it's a very good

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.940 
that's a stroker it's a very good
technique<00:01:40.840> because<00:01:41.140> it's<00:01:41.320> easy<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.680> control

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
technique because it's easy to control

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.070 
technique because it's easy to control
and<00:01:42.190> hit<00:01:42.280> your<00:01:42.430> pocket<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.030> step-up<00:01:43.720> would<00:01:43.930> be<00:01:44.050> a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
and hit your pocket a step-up would be a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.600 
and hit your pocket a step-up would be a
power<00:01:44.320> stroke<00:01:44.680> or<00:01:44.860> with<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.010> little<00:01:45.280> bit<00:01:45.400> more

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
power stroke or with a little bit more

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.760 
power stroke or with a little bit more
hand<00:01:45.850> action<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.450> little<00:01:47.020> bit<00:01:47.140> more<00:01:47.320> precise

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
hand action a little bit more precise

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.990 
hand action a little bit more precise
rotation<00:01:48.460> at<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.060> moment<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.510> release<00:01:50.110> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
rotation at the moment of release and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.490 
rotation at the moment of release and
possibly<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.090> bit<00:01:52.150> more<00:01:52.510> ball<00:01:52.780> speed<00:01:52.810> as<00:01:53.290> well

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
possibly a bit more ball speed as well

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.180 
possibly a bit more ball speed as well
the<00:01:54.040> power<00:01:54.250> stroker<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:56.500> have<00:01:56.920> a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
the power stroker would have a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.120 
the power stroker would have a
relatively<00:01:57.880> straight<00:01:58.360> wrist<00:01:58.659> maybe<00:01:59.560> collapse

relatively straight wrist maybe collapse

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.610 
relatively straight wrist maybe collapse
just<00:02:00.460> slightly<00:02:00.940> but<00:02:01.150> not<00:02:01.330> much<00:02:01.620> pretty

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
just slightly but not much pretty

now this type of delivery is generally

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.000 
now this type of delivery is generally
released<00:02:27.330> about<00:02:27.690> twenty<00:02:28.110> miles<00:02:28.260> an<00:02:28.530> hour<00:02:28.680> off

your<00:02:29.610> hand<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.300> will<00:02:30.420> average<00:02:30.630> about<00:02:31.040> Oh

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790

16 17 miles an hour as it hits the pins

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.100 
16 17 miles an hour as it hits the pins
and<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:38.610> should<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.480> an<00:02:39.630> average<00:02:39.810> velocity

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
and it should have an average velocity

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.040 
and it should have an average velocity
about<00:02:40.680> 18<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:42.480> gives<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> relative

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
about 18 so that gives you a relative

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.900 
about 18 so that gives you a relative
idea<00:02:43.410> maybe<00:02:43.950> two<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> half<00:02:44.460> seconds

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
speed as we suggested and it also

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.330 
speed as we suggested and it also
produces<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> moderate<00:03:07.080> hook<00:03:07.320> motion<00:03:07.800> the

impact with the pins and it can range

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.500 
impact with the pins and it can range
maybe<00:03:15.300> from<00:03:15.570> 20<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.050> 35<00:03:16.650> degrees<00:03:17.100> back<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.240> hook

which<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.530> modest<00:03:19.920> angle<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.490> entry

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
which is it's a modest angle of entry

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.080
