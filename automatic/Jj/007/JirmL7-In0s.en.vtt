00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.270
 hello friends welcome to my channel this 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.549
 day will be teaching them how to prepare 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.230
 a delicious atol of Salvadoran corn 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.129
 the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.580
 are the next 12 lots a cup and 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:20.019
 half of water 2 tablespoons and a half of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:24.369
 sugar 1 cup milk half teaspoon 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:27.390
 salt 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 2 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 cinnamon strips 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.920
 how it happened to me to prepare this 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.760
 delicious tuna batch we will liquefy 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.760
 corn kernels 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.350
 along with a cup and a half of water 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.510
 now it's very deep vessel let's 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.129
 place on the blanket to strain if 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.960
 you do not have blankets you can use a 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.460
 strainer but the solitos have to be 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 very thin 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 and now let's add the liquefied corn 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.480
 Y 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.190
 remember to have your hands very clean 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.190
 when will they do this step 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.609
 since we have taken out the juice we are going to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.409
 only the bagasse remains inside the 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.409
 blanket and we're going to throw it away 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.930
 now the two tablespoons of cornstarch that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.329
 we have let's add three 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.759
 tablespoons of cold water and we're going to 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.759
 Mix until they are completely 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.759
 dissolved 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.800
 now from a pre-heated pot 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.920
 we're going to add a cup of 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.920
 milk 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.730
 and in the other we are going to add the juice of the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.730
 bud that we liquefy 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.689
 ah 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.420
 after about three 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.030
 minutes since the milk is hot not 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.790
 it has to be boiling we're going to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.269
 throw into the mix we had lots 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.269
 that we liquefy 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.860
 and from this moment not to stop 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.530
 move the atol because you can cut us 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.990
 let's add the sugar 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.710
 Y 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.710
 the salt 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.190
 the two cinnamon sticks 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.230
 and the cornstarch that we had previously 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.230
 dissolved with water 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.330
 let's mix the atol until it boils 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.330
 and this you are 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.019
 since the actor has expressed the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.180
