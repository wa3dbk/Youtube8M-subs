thing is it reduces the dominance of
garages<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.250> streets<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.850> once<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.239> light<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
garages on streets so once you light it

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.229

material<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.000> front<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.570> nowadays

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
material on the front because nowadays

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
material on the front because nowadays
the<00:00:55.230> houses<00:00:55.649> most<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.700> facade<00:00:57.149> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the houses most of the facade is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
the houses most of the facade is
occupied<00:00:57.750> by<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.989> garage<00:00:58.410> door<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.399> one

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
occupied by a garage door this one

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.120 
occupied by a garage door this one
reduces<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.390> dominance<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.739> let's<00:01:01.950> walk

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
reduces that dominance so let's walk

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.549 
reduces that dominance so let's walk
inside<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.700> see<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> other<00:01:03.059> features<00:01:03.540> we<00:01:04.470> are

here<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> wall<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> looks<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.159> any

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
here we have a wall that looks like any

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.849 
here we have a wall that looks like any
other<00:01:56.969> wall<00:01:57.210> external<00:01:57.960> wall<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.649> this

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
other wall external wall but what this

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.980 
other wall external wall but what this
is<00:01:59.039> is<00:01:59.340> reverse<00:01:59.880> between<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.420> construction

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
is is reverse between your construction

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.569 
is is reverse between your construction
and<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.469> nothing<00:02:01.770> great<00:02:01.950> about<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.429> all

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and there's nothing great about it all

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.669 
and there's nothing great about it all
it<00:02:02.819> does<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.030> reverses<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> pricking<00:02:04.649> your

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
it does is reverses the pricking your

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.010 
it does is reverses the pricking your
construction<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.850> you've<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> bricks

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
construction so you've got the bricks

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.630 
construction so you've got the bricks
inside<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.740> you've<00:02:07.829> got<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.069> cladding<00:02:08.549> on

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
inside and you've got the cladding on

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880 
inside and you've got the cladding on
the<00:02:08.789> outside<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.619> do

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the outside and what does this do

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
the outside and what does this do
because<00:02:11.370> he<00:02:11.819> normally<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.480> brick<00:02:12.690> veneer

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
because he normally in brick veneer

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.080 
because he normally in brick veneer
homes<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.620> use<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.010> bricks<00:02:14.310> only<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.849> shield

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
homes we use the bricks only to shield

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
homes we use the bricks only to shield
us<00:02:15.209> from<00:02:15.269> rain<00:02:15.660> whereas<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.769> we<00:02:16.980> are<00:02:17.069> taking

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
us from rain whereas here we are taking

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.720 
us from rain whereas here we are taking
advantage<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.989> its<00:02:19.230> thermal<00:02:19.530> properties<00:02:20.129> so

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
advantage of its thermal properties so

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
advantage of its thermal properties so
what<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.060> does<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.569> absorbs<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> heat<00:02:22.440> in

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
what it does is it absorbs the heat in

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.309 
what it does is it absorbs the heat in
winter<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.879> any<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.450> heat<00:02:24.599> that's<00:02:24.780> inside

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
winter so any of the heat that's inside

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.130 
winter so any of the heat that's inside
it<00:02:25.590> warms<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.190> slowly<00:02:26.579> and<00:02:26.910> keeps<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.750> nice<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
it warms up slowly and keeps it nice and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.680 
it warms up slowly and keeps it nice and
warm<00:02:28.349> inside<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:29.280> summer<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:29.970> well<00:02:30.299> shaded

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
warm inside in summer it's well shaded

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.930 
warm inside in summer it's well shaded
so<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.290> absorbs<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.980> heat<00:02:32.010> from<00:02:32.280> our<00:02:32.489> body<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
so it absorbs the heat from our body and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.210 
so it absorbs the heat from our body and
takes<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> down<00:02:33.780> into<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.230> earth<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> keeps

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
takes it down into the earth so it keeps

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.039 
takes it down into the earth so it keeps
us<00:02:35.459> cool<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.120> does<00:02:36.329> both<00:02:36.660> summer<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
us cool so it does both summer and

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.940 
us cool so it does both summer and

layman's<00:02:44.760> term<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.420> two<00:02:46.290> panes<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.709> glass

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
layman's term it's two panes of glass

layman's term it's two panes of glass
and<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.579> got<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> heat<00:02:48.030> mirror<00:02:48.269> coating<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.870> it

finland<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.990> few<00:03:51.890> more<00:03:52.010> features<00:03:52.220> on<00:03:52.700> the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
finland a few more features on the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.870 
finland a few more features on the
outside<00:03:53.240> which<00:03:53.540> i'd<00:03:53.690> like<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.990> show<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.880> this

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
outside which i'd like to show you this

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.110 
outside which i'd like to show you this
is<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> NetZero<00:03:56.390> home<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.860> takes<00:03:58.190> no<00:03:58.940> more

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
is a NetZero home so it it takes no more

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.480 
is a NetZero home so it it takes no more
from<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.480> grid<00:03:59.660> then<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.960> puts<00:04:00.200> back<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.860> what

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
from the grid then it puts back and what

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.710 
from the grid then it puts back and what
we<00:04:01.670> have<00:04:01.910> there<00:04:02.180> up<00:04:02.360> there<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.870> 24<00:04:03.560> panels<00:04:03.980> of

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
we have there up there is 24 panels of

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.420 
we have there up there is 24 panels of
solar<00:04:05.720> electric<00:04:06.410> cells<00:04:06.710> that<00:04:06.920> can<00:04:07.130> generate

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
solar electric cells that can generate

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.820 
solar electric cells that can generate
their<00:04:07.790> own<00:04:07.820> electricity<00:04:08.390> so<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.380> home<00:04:09.620> is

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
their own electricity so this home is

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.250 
their own electricity so this home is
completely<00:04:10.310> self-sufficient<00:04:11.270> in<00:04:11.660> energy<00:04:11.810> so

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
completely self-sufficient in energy so

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.380 
completely self-sufficient in energy so
it<00:04:12.470> actually<00:04:12.680> generates<00:04:13.220> electricity<00:04:13.880> in<00:04:14.270> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
it actually generates electricity in the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.270 
it actually generates electricity in the
morning<00:04:14.660> when<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.780> sun's<00:04:15.080> up<00:04:15.290> there<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.680> then

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
morning when the sun's up there and then

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.759 
morning when the sun's up there and then
it<00:04:16.519> puts<00:04:17.030> back<00:04:17.269> into<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.660> grid<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.140> it's<00:04:18.620> sort

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
it puts back into the grid so it's sort

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.770 
it puts back into the grid so it's sort
of<00:04:18.920> it<00:04:19.100> balances<00:04:19.640> out<00:04:19.790> what<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.359> takes<00:04:20.570> from

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
of it balances out what it takes from

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.330 
of it balances out what it takes from
the<00:04:20.870> grid<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.080> what<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.470> puts<00:04:21.620> back<00:04:21.920> so<00:04:22.100> this

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
the grid and what it puts back so this

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.400 
the grid and what it puts back so this
puts<00:04:22.880> like<00:04:23.120> more<00:04:23.390> slightly<00:04:23.960> more<00:04:24.170> into<00:04:24.320> the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
puts like more slightly more into the

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.190 
puts like more slightly more into the
grid<00:04:24.560> than<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.890> takes<00:04:25.160> from<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.580> grid<00:04:25.790> and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
grid than it takes from the grid and

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.900 
grid than it takes from the grid and
there's<00:04:27.200> one<00:04:27.410> last<00:04:27.620> feature<00:04:27.920> at<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.550> back<00:04:28.730> of

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
there's one last feature at the back of

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.800 
there's one last feature at the back of
the<00:04:29.060> home<00:04:29.920> I'm<00:04:30.920> now<00:04:31.580> showing<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.600> last

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
the home I'm now showing you the last

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230 
the home I'm now showing you the last
feature<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.440> home<00:04:33.700> which<00:04:34.700> looks<00:04:34.970> like<00:04:35.090> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
feature of the home which looks like a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.780 
feature of the home which looks like a
garbage<00:04:35.540> bin<00:04:35.840> here<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.410> that<00:04:37.340> looks<00:04:37.550> like<00:04:37.640> a

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
garbage bin here and that looks like a

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.120 
garbage bin here and that looks like a
little<00:04:38.180> tank<00:04:38.510> here<00:04:38.810> this<00:04:39.440> one<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> grey

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
little tank here this one is a grey

little tank here this one is a grey
water<00:04:40.370> recycling<00:04:41.000> system<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:42.260> so<00:04:42.500> neat<00:04:42.770> and

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
water recycling system it's so neat and

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.420 
water recycling system it's so neat and
compact<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:43.880> not<00:04:44.120> intrusive<00:04:44.660> at<00:04:44.930> all<00:04:45.110> and

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
compact it's not intrusive at all and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.250 
compact it's not intrusive at all and
what<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.580> does<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:47.090> takes<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.540> water<00:04:47.780> the

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
what it does is it takes the water the

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.760 
what it does is it takes the water the
gray<00:04:48.470> water<00:04:48.680> from<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.550> showers<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:50.780> from<00:04:51.560> the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
that it has no smell nothing it just

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.720 
that it has no smell nothing it just
works<00:05:01.700> beautifully<00:05:01.940> it's<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:02.540> neat<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:02.990> the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
works beautifully it's so neat and the

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.310 
works beautifully it's so neat and the
recycled<00:05:04.730> water<00:05:04.850> then<00:05:05.150> flows<00:05:05.360> into<00:05:05.480> this<00:05:06.020> tank

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
recycled water then flows into this tank

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.370 
recycled water then flows into this tank
and<00:05:06.850> then<00:05:07.850> from<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.210> tank<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.720> goes<00:05:08.960> into<00:05:09.169> the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
and then from the tank it goes into the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.440 
and then from the tank it goes into the
garden<00:05:09.770> it<00:05:09.919> goes<00:05:10.160> into<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.550> toilets<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.240> it

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
garden it goes into the toilets and it

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.330 
garden it goes into the toilets and it
also<00:05:11.720> goes<00:05:12.080> into<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.470> laundry<00:05:12.650> in<00:05:12.980> fact<00:05:13.190> he

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
also goes into the laundry in fact he

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.330 
also goes into the laundry in fact he
said<00:05:13.580> it's<00:05:14.090> as<00:05:14.330> good<00:05:14.750> quality<00:05:15.710> as<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.190> you

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
said it's as good quality as that you

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.950 
said it's as good quality as that you
can<00:05:16.550> actually<00:05:16.700> drink<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:17.510> it's<00:05:17.690> probably

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
can actually drink it but it's probably

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.020 
can actually drink it but it's probably
psychological<00:05:18.530> reasons<00:05:19.340> we<00:05:19.460> wouldn't<00:05:19.850> link

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
psychological reasons we wouldn't link

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.300 
psychological reasons we wouldn't link
it<00:05:20.210> but<00:05:20.419> it's<00:05:20.690> as<00:05:20.990> good<00:05:21.290> that<00:05:21.770> it's<00:05:21.950> drinkable

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
it but it's as good that it's drinkable

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.450 
it but it's as good that it's drinkable
