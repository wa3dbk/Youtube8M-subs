the welding and all the cutting so he
had<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.640> put<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:44.970> piece<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.660> they'll

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
had just put the piece in and they'll

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.930 
had just put the piece in and they'll
bend<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.290> we're<00:00:46.530> also<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> build<00:00:47.489> one

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
bend it we're also going to build one

bend it we're also going to build one
for<00:00:48.420> another<00:00:49.320> gig<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.220> this<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.610> here

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
for another gig which is this right here

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
for another gig which is this right here
to<00:00:51.930> make<00:00:52.140> square<00:00:52.739> brackets<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.880> we<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to make square brackets that we use a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.290 
to make square brackets that we use a
lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.870> square<00:00:55.170> brackets<00:00:55.649> needs<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.040> be

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
lot of the square brackets needs to be

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.220 
lot of the square brackets needs to be
like<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.610> take<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.880> plate<00:01:00.239> take<00:01:00.809> two

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
like this and we take a plate take two

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.340 
like this and we take a plate take two
pieces<00:01:01.500> wall<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.600> which<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.080> fit

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
pieces wall them on which was in a fit

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.240 
pieces wall them on which was in a fit
of<00:01:04.830> vision<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.020> we<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.710> piece<00:01:07.979> will

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
of vision so we make it one piece will

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190 
of vision so we make it one piece will
emanate<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> cut<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.690> single

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
emanate two of them to cut and single

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.400 
emanate two of them to cut and single
mat<00:01:10.410> well<00:01:11.160> I'm<00:01:11.280> saying<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:11.850> easy<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.509> to

gig on here so we can bend the square
and<00:02:15.410> I'll<00:02:15.620> show<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.890> how<00:02:16.100> we<00:02:16.160> do<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.489> how

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and I'll show you how we do that how

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.470 
and I'll show you how we do that how
simple<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:18.400> there's<00:02:19.400> been<00:02:19.610> test<00:02:19.880> one<00:02:20.090> we

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
simple that is there's been test one we

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.449 
simple that is there's been test one we
should<00:02:20.630> turned<00:02:20.780> out<00:02:20.930> really<00:02:21.110> good<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.470> and

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
should turned out really good and and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.809 
should turned out really good and and
now<00:02:23.180> all<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.540> do<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.019> is<00:02:24.380> go<00:02:24.920> straight

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
now all we do to this is go straight

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.320 
now all we do to this is go straight
through<00:02:26.239> four<00:02:26.810> pins<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.709> one<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.489> then

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
through four pins of one here and then

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.059 
through four pins of one here and then
we'll<00:02:29.480> drill<00:02:29.690> coming<00:02:30.019> back<00:02:30.170> put<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> book<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.980> it

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069
