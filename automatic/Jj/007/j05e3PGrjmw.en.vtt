twenty<00:00:40.110> five<00:00:45.379> turn<00:00:46.379> great<00:00:46.620> foot<00:00:46.890> moment

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
twenty five turn great foot moment

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.229 
twenty five turn great foot moment
things<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:50.039> very

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.099 

I<00:00:55.879> was<00:00:56.879> talking<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> doll<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.719> chain<00:00:57.989> me

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I was talking to a doll about chain me

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.209 
I was talking to a doll about chain me
and<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.350> thought<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> great

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and we thought this would be a great

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
and we thought this would be a great
place<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> start<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.329> chain<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> kind

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
place to start because a chain is a kind

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.729 
place to start because a chain is a kind
of<00:01:01.440> fundamental<00:01:02.100> part<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.489> any<00:01:02.640> jewelry

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
of fundamental part of any jewelry

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.560 
of fundamental part of any jewelry
this<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.100> great<00:01:04.400> chat<00:01:04.640> it's<00:01:04.790> called<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.120> Roman

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
this is a great chat it's called a Roman

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.960 
this is a great chat it's called a Roman
loop<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.500> Luba<00:01:06.830> chain<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.430> it's<00:01:07.549> actually<00:01:07.909> a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
loop in Luba chain and it's actually a

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.359 
loop in Luba chain and it's actually a
very<00:01:08.000> very<00:01:08.420> ancient<00:01:08.900> technique<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:10.190> was

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
very very ancient technique that was

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.040 
very very ancient technique that was
founded<00:01:10.790> by<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:10.970> Romans<00:01:11.210> literally

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
founded by the Romans literally

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.899 
founded by the Romans literally
thousands<00:01:12.619> of<00:01:12.680> years<00:01:12.890> ago<00:01:13.070> puts<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.729> wire

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
thousands of years ago puts the wire

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.930 
thousands of years ago puts the wire
around<00:01:14.150> it's<00:01:14.479> out<00:01:14.630> make<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> few<00:01:15.500> links<00:01:15.940> slide

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
around it's out make a few links slide

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.370 
around it's out make a few links slide
them<00:01:17.150> off<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.600> I'm<00:01:17.690> just<00:01:17.840> gonna<00:01:18.020> cut<00:01:18.229> them

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
them off and I'm just gonna cut them

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.499 
them off and I'm just gonna cut them
right<00:01:18.530> here<00:01:18.740> while<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.490> edges<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.330> they're

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
right here while the edges so they're

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.139 
right here while the edges so they're
perfectly<00:01:20.960> flat<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.640> once<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.970> get<00:01:23.090> your

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
perfectly flat so once you get your

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.999 
perfectly flat so once you get your
edges<00:01:23.630> together<00:01:23.810> really<00:01:24.229> perfectly<00:01:24.890> you're

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
edges together really perfectly you're

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.410 
edges together really perfectly you're
gonna<00:01:25.100> be<00:01:25.280> ready<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.580> solder<00:01:25.820> if<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.240> don't

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
gonna be ready to solder if you don't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.760 
gonna be ready to solder if you don't
want<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.659> be<00:01:26.750> soldering<00:01:27.110> on<00:01:27.259> wood<00:01:27.500> although

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
want to be soldering on wood although

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.670 
want to be soldering on wood although
I've<00:01:27.890> seen<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:32.030> use<00:01:32.470> charcoal<00:01:33.470> block

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
I've seen that we use charcoal block

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.980 
I've seen that we use charcoal block
doing<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.640> technique<00:01:35.000> that's<00:01:35.149> called<00:01:35.360> fusing

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
doing a technique that's called fusing

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.260 
doing a technique that's called fusing
which<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.039> to<00:01:37.250> heat<00:01:37.550> up<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.789> metal<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.240> that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
which is to heat up the metal so that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.419 
which is to heat up the metal so that
two<00:01:38.570> edges<00:01:38.869> run<00:01:39.020> into<00:01:39.289> each<00:01:39.410> other<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.070> once<00:01:40.280> I

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
two edges run into each other so once I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.760 
two edges run into each other so once I
have<00:01:40.610> my<00:01:40.640> piece<00:01:41.450> fused<00:01:42.170> together<00:01:42.350> I'm<00:01:42.649> gonna

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
have my piece fused together I'm gonna

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.249 
have my piece fused together I'm gonna
cool<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.280> some<00:01:43.460> water<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.000> take<00:01:44.509> my<00:01:44.690> link<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
cool it in some water I take my link and

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.440 
cool it in some water I take my link and
I'm<00:01:46.100> going<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.399> open<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.759> like<00:01:46.940> this<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.330> to

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
I'm going to open it like this and to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.480 
I'm going to open it like this and to
make<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.630> long<00:01:47.990> kind<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.590> sausage<00:01:49.190> feel<00:01:49.340> if

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
make a long kind of sausage feel if

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.980 
make a long kind of sausage feel if
anything<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.390> gonna<00:01:50.539> use<00:01:50.630> my<00:01:50.780> pliers

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
anything then I'm gonna use my pliers

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.300 
anything then I'm gonna use my pliers
again<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.470> I'm<00:01:51.530> gonna<00:01:51.679> crimp<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.250> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
again and I'm gonna crimp it in the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.650 
again and I'm gonna crimp it in the
middle<00:01:52.580> we<00:01:52.820> have<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.119> little<00:01:53.420> butterfly

middle we have like a little butterfly
shape<00:01:54.110> we're<00:01:54.830> gonna<00:01:54.920> make<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.340> into<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:56.119> it's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
shape we're gonna make it into that it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.919
