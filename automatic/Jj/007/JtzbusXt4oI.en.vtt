00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 Hello everyone, we continue to meet with 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.200
 elements of the group of power outputs on 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.180
 horizontal bar and today we will study so 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.460
 called officer's exit like not 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.620
 difficult to guess by the name of the officer 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 output came to us from the army and according to 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.460
 most is a sign of excellent 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 physical training to study this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 I recommend the item only after 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 studying the exit for one hand and therefore 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 we will assume that you already know what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.320
 such a flag know how to go out and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.960
 may hold on to it for a while 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 and now the fun part is all 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 his box you have to bring the second 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 hand behind back to leave there one more 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.760
 checkbox and then push the dock all the way with 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 back each of these steps 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 practiced on the bars or on the low 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 first of all learn how to put the crossbar 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.970
 checkbox behind you need 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.040
 remember where exactly the vulture is and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.480
 get used to tick this box 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.480
 convenient distance from 1 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.100
 make it easier standing on the ground while doing so 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.290
 you will spend less power the hardest part 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.890
 this exercise is to put the weight to yourself 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 behind 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.200
 can't go on a bar and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 study push-ups on one pole 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.130
 settling down to her for but very 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.330
 it is important that when you do pushups 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 should sag 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770
 and drive your legs a little under the crossbar 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 all in this element there is one and that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.660
 same problem and about 95 percent 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.910
 people studying element complain that they have 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.310
 not prolazit ass the remaining five percent 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.350
 just think so but no silence 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.840
 solutions except how to increase the amount 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.450
 workouts on the bars I offer here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.970
 Alas I can not this is a pure matter of practice 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.410
 yes of course during training you can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.580
 sometimes need to resort to help 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.190
 partner and of course you can go to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.800
 groove swinging or jerking up 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.960
 millimeter 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.810
 but our ultimate goal is to fulfill the element 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.520
 calm easy 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.530
