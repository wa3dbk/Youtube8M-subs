most important tips I can tell you so
let's<00:01:09.830> keep<00:01:09.980> reading<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.430> question<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.750> what

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
let's keep reading the question so what

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.770 
let's keep reading the question so what
we've<00:01:12.860> got<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.280> we've<00:01:13.490> got<00:01:14.000> an<00:01:14.830> angle<00:01:15.830> ABC

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
we've got is we've got an angle ABC

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.860 
we've got is we've got an angle ABC
angle<00:01:17.780> ABC<00:01:18.230> and<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:19.700> means<00:01:19.970> as<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.390> go<00:01:20.540> from<00:01:20.690> A

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
angle ABC and that means as I go from A

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.970 
angle ABC and that means as I go from A
to<00:01:21.350> B<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:22.250> C<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:23.330> angle<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.870> be<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.740> this

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
to B to C the angle that be so this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.420 
to B to C the angle that be so this
angle<00:01:25.190> here<00:01:25.930> okay<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.200> tells<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.250> that

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
angle here okay it tells you that that

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.870 
angle here okay it tells you that that
is<00:01:28.580> equal<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.000> angle<00:01:29.240> B<00:01:29.630> C<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.190> as<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.460> go<00:01:31.640> from

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
is equal to angle B C a so as I go from

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.120 
is equal to angle B C a so as I go from
B<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.600> C<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.980> a<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.820> angle<00:01:35.210> at<00:01:35.270> sea<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.860> these

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
B to C to a the angle at sea so these

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.940 
B to C to a the angle at sea so these
two<00:01:37.490> are<00:01:37.700> equal<00:01:37.940> now<00:01:38.450> if<00:01:38.960> those<00:01:39.230> two<00:01:39.500> angles

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
two are equal now if those two angles

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.090 
two are equal now if those two angles
are<00:01:40.070> equal<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:41.390> these<00:01:41.900> two<00:01:41.960> sides<00:01:42.560> must<00:01:42.920> be

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
are equal then these two sides must be

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.030 
are equal then these two sides must be
equal<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> each<00:01:43.760> other<00:01:44.020> okay<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.620> what<00:01:45.770> i<00:01:45.800> can

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
equal to each other okay so what i can

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.020 
equal to each other okay so what i can
do<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.510> i<00:01:47.510> can<00:01:47.540> therefore<00:01:47.990> state<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:49.220> because

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
do is i can therefore state that because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:59.200 
do is i can therefore state that because
they<00:01:50.210> are<00:01:50.270> equal<00:01:50.560> since<00:01:53.140> angles<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:56.380> B<00:01:57.430> C<00:01:58.430> equals

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
they are equal since angles a B C equals

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.950 
they are equal since angles a B C equals
B<00:01:59.540> see<00:02:00.260> a<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.640> state<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.420> length<00:02:04.960> us

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
B see a you can state that the length us

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
B see a you can state that the length us
are<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.890> same<00:02:07.390> so

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
are the same so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.250 
are the same so
state<00:02:10.040> your<00:02:11.210> fact<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> fact<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.050> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
state your fact that the fact that you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.320 
state your fact that the fact that you
will<00:02:13.380> use<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.820> mark<00:02:15.210> for

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
will use it and you can get a mark for

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.240 
will use it and you can get a mark for
stating<00:02:15.780> your<00:02:16.470> fat<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.740> say<00:02:19.980> is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
stating your fat so what you can say is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.790 
stating your fat so what you can say is
therefore<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.630> say<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.200> side<00:02:22.530> is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
therefore you can say that this side is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.190 
therefore you can say that this side is
equal<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.550> side<00:02:23.820> okay<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.960> would

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
equal to this side okay so you would

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.770 
equal to this side okay so you would
write<00:02:25.410> number<00:02:25.740> 3<00:02:26.130> X<00:02:27.260> subtract<00:02:28.260> 5<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:29.520> equal<00:02:29.780> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
write number 3 X subtract 5 is equal to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.110 
write number 3 X subtract 5 is equal to
19<00:02:31.940> subtract<00:02:32.940> X<00:02:34.010> okay<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.610> you're<00:02:35.790> trying<00:02:36.000> to

with<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> balance<00:02:42.030> method<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.750> I'll<00:02:42.990> show

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
with the balance method so I'll show

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.910 
with the balance method so I'll show
this<00:02:43.740> in<00:02:43.950> two<00:02:44.250> different<00:02:44.970> ways<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.920> firstly

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
this in two different ways and firstly

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
this in two different ways and firstly
you<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.400> all<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> X's<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.090> one<00:02:48.180> side<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.630> you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
you get all the X's on one side so you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.610 
you get all the X's on one side so you
can<00:02:48.750> add<00:02:49.020> X<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.860> side<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.690> add<00:02:51.690> X<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.230> this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
can add X to this side and add X to this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.700 
can add X to this side and add X to this
side<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:53.970> sure<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.750> negative<00:02:55.500> x

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
side to make sure that this negative x

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.280 
side to make sure that this negative x
disappears<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.180> would<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.720> for<00:02:58.020> X

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
disappears so you would get that for X

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.170 
disappears so you would get that for X
subtract<00:02:59.190> 5<00:02:59.580> is<00:03:00.210> equal<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.750> 19<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.790> want

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
subtract 5 is equal to 19 now you want

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120 
subtract 5 is equal to 19 now you want
the<00:03:03.300> X<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.630> by<00:03:03.780> itself<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.530> get<00:03:04.680> rid<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.890> that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
the X all by itself to get rid of that

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.800 
the X all by itself to get rid of that
negative<00:03:05.340> 5<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.510> add<00:03:06.780> 5<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.500> both<00:03:07.530> sides<00:03:07.710> and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
negative 5 you add 5 to both sides and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.410 
negative 5 you add 5 to both sides and
you<00:03:09.810> will<00:03:09.960> get<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.410> 4x<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:12.660> equal<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:14.090> 24<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
you will get that 4x is equal to 24 and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.190 
you will get that 4x is equal to 24 and
lastly<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:17.010> would<00:03:17.190> divide<00:03:17.370> by<00:03:17.880> 4<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
lastly you would divide by 4 so you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.890 
lastly you would divide by 4 so you
would<00:03:19.320> divide<00:03:19.470> both<00:03:19.830> sides<00:03:19.890> by<00:03:20.280> 4<00:03:20.430> 1<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.300> 4x<00:03:21.750> is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
would divide both sides by 4 1 if 4x is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.380 
would divide both sides by 4 1 if 4x is
24<00:03:22.470> 1<00:03:22.980> X<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:24.080> 24<00:03:25.130> divided<00:03:26.130> by<00:03:26.280> 4<00:03:26.670> which<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.360> equal

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
24 1 X is 24 divided by 4 which is equal

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.530 
24 1 X is 24 divided by 4 which is equal
to<00:03:27.750> 6<00:03:28.970> ok<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.420> X<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.900> six<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:32.540> alternatively

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
to 6 ok so X is six now alternatively

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.930 
to 6 ok so X is six now alternatively

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
students like to do is that subtract 5

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.540 
students like to do is that subtract 5
they<00:04:13.200> would<00:04:13.380> bring<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.680> over<00:04:14.040> with<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.430> other

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
they would bring it over with the other

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.210 
they would bring it over with the other
number<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.300> will<00:04:15.390> become<00:04:15.720> by<00:04:16.320> an<00:04:16.620> add<00:04:16.890> five

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
number and it will become by an add five

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.289 
number and it will become by an add five
so<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.970> would<00:04:18.090> get<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.359> 4x<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.200> equal<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.739> 90

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
so you would get the 4x is equal to 90

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.719 
so you would get the 4x is equal to 90
add<00:04:20.629> five<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:22.009> 4x<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:23.000> equal<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.599> 24<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.889> lastly

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
add five so 4x is equal to 24 and lastly

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.990 
add five so 4x is equal to 24 and lastly
that<00:04:26.539> multiplying<00:04:27.440> by<00:04:27.650> four<00:04:27.979> when<00:04:28.699> it<00:04:28.819> goes<00:04:28.970> on

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
that multiplying by four when it goes on

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.119 
that multiplying by four when it goes on
the<00:04:29.120> other<00:04:29.330> side<00:04:29.509> becomes<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.930> divided<00:04:30.259> so<00:04:30.650> X<00:04:30.889> is

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
the other side becomes a divided so X is

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.589 
the other side becomes a divided so X is
24<00:04:32.090> divided<00:04:33.020> by<00:04:33.110> 4<00:04:33.470> which<00:04:33.949> is<00:04:34.159> six<00:04:34.430> now<00:04:35.300> I

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
24 divided by 4 which is six now I

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.450 
24 divided by 4 which is six now I

might<00:04:42.650> want<00:04:42.889> to<00:04:42.949> use<00:04:43.190> it<00:04:43.430> okay<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.449> have<00:04:44.629> to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
might want to use it okay so you have to

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.830 
might want to use it okay so you have to
show<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.349> working<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.069> x<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.789> equal<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.479> 6<00:04:48.349> but

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
show that working so x is equal to 6 but

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.450 
show that working so x is equal to 6 but
that<00:04:50.840> wasn't<00:04:51.110> what<00:04:51.349> the<00:04:51.470> question<00:04:51.860> are<00:04:52.039> so<00:04:52.280> go

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
that wasn't what the question are so go

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.619 
that wasn't what the question are so go
back<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.879> our<00:04:52.940> question<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.389> read<00:04:53.599> it

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
back to our question and read it

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.680 
back to our question and read it
carefully<00:04:54.129> work<00:04:55.129> out<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.580> perimeter<00:04:55.849> of<00:04:56.449> the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
carefully work out the perimeter of the

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.320 
carefully work out the perimeter of the
triangle<00:04:56.990> give<00:04:57.830> your<00:04:58.039> answer<00:04:58.250> as<00:04:58.729> a<00:04:58.789> number<00:04:59.270> of

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
triangle give your answer as a number of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.980 
triangle give your answer as a number of
centimeters<00:05:00.050> okay<00:05:00.919> so<00:05:01.669> what<00:05:02.599> we're<00:05:02.719> going<00:05:02.870> to

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
centimeters okay so what we're going to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.950 
centimeters okay so what we're going to
have<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.199> do<00:05:03.349> is<00:05:03.560> state<00:05:04.430> each<00:05:04.789> of<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.300> sides<00:05:05.599> so

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
have to do is state each of the sides so

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.200 
have to do is state each of the sides so
I'm<00:05:06.800> going<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:06.979> keep<00:05:07.129> going<00:05:07.460> here<00:05:07.639> extend<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
I'm going to keep going here extend the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.939 
I'm going to keep going here extend the
page<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:09.590> we<00:05:09.620> know<00:05:09.889> that<00:05:10.039> X<00:05:10.219> is<00:05:10.400> 6<00:05:10.729> and<00:05:11.949> we've

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
page so we know that X is 6 and we've

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.279 
page so we know that X is 6 and we've
got<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.250> three<00:05:13.490> sides<00:05:13.759> the<00:05:14.389> three<00:05:14.659> sides<00:05:14.960> are

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
got the three sides the three sides are

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.570 
got the three sides the three sides are
3<00:05:16.159> X<00:05:16.310> subtract<00:05:16.669> 519<00:05:17.419> subtract<00:05:17.840> x<00:05:18.050> +<00:05:18.289> 2<00:05:18.349> X<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:19.400> our

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
3 X subtract 519 subtract x + 2 X so our

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.459 
3 X subtract 519 subtract x + 2 X so our
three<00:05:19.849> sides<00:05:20.620> are<00:05:21.620> 3<00:05:21.919> X<00:05:22.129> subtract<00:05:23.469> 519

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
three sides are 3 X subtract 519

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.120 
three sides are 3 X subtract 519
subtract<00:05:25.039> x<00:05:25.599> +<00:05:26.599> 2<00:05:26.630> X<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.710> we<00:05:27.860> need<00:05:28.009> to

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
subtract x + 2 X so we need to

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.249 
subtract x + 2 X so we need to
substitute<00:05:28.400> 6<00:05:30.490> in<00:05:31.490> for<00:05:32.090> X<00:05:32.330> in<00:05:32.630> each<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:33.080> these

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
substitute 6 in for X in each of these

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.050 
substitute 6 in for X in each of these
and<00:05:33.789> work<00:05:34.789> out<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.029> three<00:05:35.360> sides<00:05:35.659> so<00:05:36.529> if<00:05:36.940> 61<00:05:37.940> in

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
and work out the three sides so if 61 in

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.659 
and work out the three sides so if 61 in
here<00:05:38.300> we<00:05:38.449> would<00:05:38.569> have<00:05:38.599> 19<00:05:39.199> subtract<00:05:39.800> 6<00:05:40.130> which

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
here we would have 19 subtract 6 which

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.480 
here we would have 19 subtract 6 which
is<00:05:40.849> equal<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.150> 13<00:05:41.630> centimeters<00:05:42.409> if<00:05:42.889> six<00:05:43.250> went

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
is equal to 13 centimeters if six went

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.990 
is equal to 13 centimeters if six went
in<00:05:43.639> here<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:44.029> would<00:05:44.150> be<00:05:44.300> to<00:05:44.650> x<00:05:45.650> 6<00:05:46.219> which<00:05:46.759> would

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
in here it would be to x 6 which would

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.570 
in here it would be to x 6 which would
be<00:05:47.150> 12<00:05:47.419> centimeters<00:05:48.259> and<00:05:48.440> if<00:05:49.009> six<00:05:49.250> wins<00:05:49.490> in

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
be 12 centimeters and if six wins in

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.830 
be 12 centimeters and if six wins in
here<00:05:49.849> it<00:05:50.060> would<00:05:50.180> be<00:05:50.330> 3<00:05:50.629> x<00:05:51.319> 6<00:05:51.919> subtract<00:05:52.909> 5<00:05:53.180> which

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
here it would be 3 x 6 subtract 5 which

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.680 
here it would be 3 x 6 subtract 5 which
is<00:05:53.870> 18<00:05:54.379> subtract<00:05:54.830> 5<00:05:55.069> which<00:05:55.370> is<00:05:55.400> 13<00:05:56.000> centimeters

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
is 18 subtract 5 which is 13 centimeters

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.629 
is 18 subtract 5 which is 13 centimeters
now<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.560> should<00:05:57.800> have<00:05:57.830> known<00:05:58.099> that<00:05:58.129> these<00:05:58.400> two

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
now you should have known that these two

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.490 
now you should have known that these two
are<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:58.879> same<00:05:59.120> because<00:05:59.719> we<00:05:59.900> had<00:06:00.020> shown<00:06:00.319> that

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
are the same because we had shown that

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.439 
are the same because we had shown that
earlier<00:06:00.919> we<00:06:01.430> knew<00:06:01.610> those<00:06:01.819> two<00:06:01.849> were<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.180> same

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
earlier we knew those two were the same

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.040 
earlier we knew those two were the same
so<00:06:02.750> we've<00:06:02.900> got<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.080> 13<00:06:03.560> 13<00:06:04.279> and<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:04.610> 12<00:06:04.940> so<00:06:05.870> the

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
so we've got a 13 13 and the 12 so the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.260 
so we've got a 13 13 and the 12 so the
total<00:06:06.289> perimeter<00:06:06.830> is<00:06:07.340> 13<00:06:08.270> +<00:06:08.659> 13<00:06:09.259> @<00:06:09.610> 12<00:06:10.610> which<00:06:11.240> is

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
total perimeter is 13 + 13 @ 12 which is

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.480 
total perimeter is 13 + 13 @ 12 which is
going<00:06:11.599> to<00:06:11.719> be<00:06:11.810> equal<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.500> 38<00:06:14.169> centimeters<00:06:15.490> so

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
going to be equal to 38 centimeters so

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.390 
going to be equal to 38 centimeters so
state<00:06:16.789> your<00:06:16.819> onto<00:06:17.300> here<00:06:17.509> 38<00:06:18.379> centimeters<00:06:19.219> and

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
state your onto here 38 centimeters and

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.209 
state your onto here 38 centimeters and
we've<00:06:19.909> done<00:06:20.090> for<00:06:20.330> that<00:06:20.569> question<00:06:21.050> key<00:06:21.919> thing

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
we've done for that question key thing

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.600 
we've done for that question key thing
is<00:06:22.300> do<00:06:23.300> not<00:06:23.479> measure<00:06:23.750> use<00:06:24.560> logic<00:06:25.099> once<00:06:25.460> you

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
is do not measure use logic once you

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.640 
is do not measure use logic once you
know<00:06:25.819> the<00:06:26.000> angles<00:06:26.360> are<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:26.569> same<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:27.469> know

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
know the angles are the same you know

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.070 
know the angles are the same you know
these<00:06:27.830> two<00:06:28.069> sides<00:06:28.370> are<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.669> same<00:06:28.759> you<00:06:29.630> can<00:06:29.810> set

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
these two sides are the same you can set

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.239 
these two sides are the same you can set
an<00:06:30.199> equation<00:06:30.500> up<00:06:30.860> find<00:06:31.520> out

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:32.249 
an equation up find out

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.699 
an equation up find out
and<00:06:32.339> then<00:06:32.639> put<00:06:33.059> X<00:06:33.269> into<00:06:33.659> each<00:06:33.809> of<00:06:34.019> these<00:06:34.199> to

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
and then put X into each of these to

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:38.329 
and then put X into each of these to
find<00:06:34.979> the<00:06:35.159> lengths<00:06:35.549> ok
