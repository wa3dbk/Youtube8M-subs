actually<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> little<00:03:10.270> bit<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.540> extra<00:03:10.840> fat<00:03:11.140> right

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
actually a little bit of extra fat right

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.260 
actually a little bit of extra fat right
now<00:03:11.590> especially

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
now especially

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.150 
now especially
kind<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.660> lowering<00:03:13.900> carbs<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.010> last

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
couple days so the extra fat is kind of

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.980 
couple days so the extra fat is kind of
to<00:03:20.760> compensate<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.420> gallery<00:03:21.780> who<00:03:22.140> knows

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990

I've<00:05:12.639> read<00:05:13.639> a<00:05:13.669> lot<00:05:13.880> about<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.480> just<00:05:15.230> figured

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
I've read a lot about it just figured

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.290 
I've read a lot about it just figured
that<00:05:15.620> why<00:05:15.919> not<00:05:16.100> stick<00:05:16.310> with<00:05:16.490> what<00:05:16.639> I'm<00:05:16.760> doing

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
that why not stick with what I'm doing

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.120 
that why not stick with what I'm doing
the<00:05:17.389> whole<00:05:17.570> time<00:05:17.780> rather<00:05:18.169> than<00:05:18.350> kind<00:05:19.010> of

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
the whole time rather than kind of

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.000 
the whole time rather than kind of
throwing<00:05:19.490> another<00:05:19.780> another<00:05:20.800> variable<00:05:21.800> in<00:05:21.889> the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
throwing another another variable in the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.320 
throwing another another variable in the
equation<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:22.940> it

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
equation that's it

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.560 
equation that's it
I'll<00:05:23.419> stick<00:05:23.630> with<00:05:23.660> drinking<00:05:24.110> water<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:25.570> mean

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
omega-3 so I get these

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.440 
omega-3 so I get these
the<00:06:41.930> expense<00:06:42.380> of<00:06:42.710> cage-free<00:06:43.220> large

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
the expense of cage-free large

so I get up to and I know they're high

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.640 
so I get up to and I know they're high
omega-3<00:06:59.050> is

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
omega-3 is

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.810 
omega-3 is
it's<00:07:01.010> probably<00:07:01.250> better<00:07:01.430> for<00:07:01.550> me

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
it's probably better for me

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.990
