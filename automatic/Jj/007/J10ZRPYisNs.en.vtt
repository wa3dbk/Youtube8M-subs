 super simple hairstyle in trend and 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.009

 school for your work stay watching it 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.139
 as December and I am not a person 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.930
 in the mornings then this hairstyle me 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.690
 love because it is very easy very nice 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.800
 is in trend and as I said and 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.800
 they are adapted for 5 to 6 minutes 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 we start 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.920
 you're going to need incredible and two gigs 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.500
 for hair my hair is just fresh 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 dried but if you want you can 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.519
 ask yourself what or curling that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 is on your side and participate in your 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.320
 simple first simply comb it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 so there are no knots and you can 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.460
 work easily with him 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.750
 to perfectly separate the section 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.910
 what are you going to use of the hair you are going to 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.100
 Depose your index fingers determine the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.350
 eyebrows and it's going to be directly towards 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.880
 up separating this section and by the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.340
 back will simply go up 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.340
 the lines creating a rectangle 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 ah 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.460
 Now with the brush, you will say everything 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.750
 fringe back to join it to the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.680
 section of hair that we are going to 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.680
 use for the show 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.600
 what we are going to do now is very 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.420
 simple is a chongo medium you are going to take 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.420
 your league and you're going round and round 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.390
 creating a mini onion with the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.280
 hair section when you have everything in 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.780
 your place you're just going to pass the league 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.780
 above giving the three laps 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 i 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.120
 and now very carefully you're going to start 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.950
 to take little boys of the onion that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.400
 you created and you're going to start pulling towards 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.299
 down 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.440
 to give it a shape of a chongo or a 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:30.660
 onion rather a little thicker 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.030
 and with the incredible ones you are going to put us in 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.370
 their place so they do not move used 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.550
 how many you want and when you have the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.550
 perfect shape that you decided for your 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.550
 onion 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.790
 Y 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.410
 and to help them stop a little bit 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.810
 more let's put another league on top 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.060
 it's simply bases that you tighten a 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.459
 little more and do not leave so many 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.350
 hairs everywhere do not worry 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.170
 of that little hair around here that does not 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.540
 it's perfect because this hairstyle is 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.420
 supposed to have messed up nothing 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.069
 totally is the joke of this hairstyle 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.780
 that is trending now I father him 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.760
 this hairstyle I always appreciate everything 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.200
 spoken though it 's different and it's very 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.170
 simple to do you get up on the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.310
 tomorrow you pick up your hair like this and ready 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.310
 ready for school 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.909
 and now you can put some spray 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.720
 so that your little candles were left 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.590
 that is not out there 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.590
 and nothing more 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.319
 you can put a bow a ribbon or what 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.319
 that you want to decorate them
