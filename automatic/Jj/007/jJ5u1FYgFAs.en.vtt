pronation which is the most common looks

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
pronation which is the most common looks
like<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> foot<00:00:58.140> touches<00:00:58.559> the

like this when the foot touches the
ground<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.640> foot<00:00:59.879> rolls<00:01:00.090> inward<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.930> but

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ground the foot rolls inward some but

ground the foot rolls inward some but
not<00:01:01.350> dramatically<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.059> foot<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
foot when you pronate normally you can

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.960 
foot when you pronate normally you can
also<00:01:12.630> push<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.799> your<00:01:13.950> next<00:01:14.220> stride<00:01:14.520> most

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
also push off into your next stride most

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.630 
also push off into your next stride most
efficiently<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> look<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.220> over

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
efficiently now have a look at over

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.539 
efficiently now have a look at over
pronation<00:01:18.170> see<00:01:19.170> how<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> foot<00:01:19.710> rolls<00:01:19.950> inward

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
pronation see how the foot rolls inward

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.420 
pronation see how the foot rolls inward
at<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.060> extreme<00:01:21.570> angle<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.950> makes<00:01:23.250> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
at a more extreme angle this makes it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
at a more extreme angle this makes it
harder<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.030> foot<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.420> ankle<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.960> handle

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the impact of your stride making it less

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.300 
the impact of your stride making it less

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
efficient and making you more

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
efficient and making you more

injuries<00:01:31.920> over<00:01:32.579> pronation<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.479> range<00:01:33.780> from

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
injuries over pronation can range from

injuries over pronation can range from
mild<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> severe<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.880> third<00:01:36.150> kind<00:01:36.450> of

mild to severe the third kind of
pronation<00:01:37.020> under<00:01:37.920> pronation<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.700> extremely

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pronation under pronation is extremely

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
pronation under pronation is extremely
rare<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> under<00:01:41.189> pronator

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
rare but you can see that under pronator

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
rare but you can see that under pronator
x'<00:01:41.909> tend<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> roll<00:01:42.600> their<00:01:42.840> feet<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.259> ankles

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
x' tend to roll their feet and ankles

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.219 
x' tend to roll their feet and ankles
outward<00:01:44.189> during<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> stride<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.780> over

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
outward during the stride like over

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.969 
outward during the stride like over
pronation<00:01:46.470> under<00:01:47.280> pronation<00:01:47.670> isn't<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.450> ideal

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
pronation under pronation isn't as ideal

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
pronation under pronation isn't as ideal
so<00:01:49.979> how<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.399> figure<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.450> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
so how do you figure out which kind of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990 
so how do you figure out which kind of
pronator<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.100> best<00:01:53.369> way<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> have

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
pronator you are the best way is to have

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.569 
pronator you are the best way is to have
a<00:01:54.180> professional<00:01:54.479> observe<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.619> stride<00:01:56.009> that

a very high arch and are also likely a

a very high arch and are also likely a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
normal pronator but there's a chance

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.640 
you can see nearly all of your footprint
that<00:02:45.120> means<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.569> have<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> low<00:02:46.049> arch<00:02:46.319> and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that means you have a low arch and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.410 
that means you have a low arch and
there's<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.980> good<00:02:47.250> chance<00:02:47.549> you're<00:02:47.879> an<00:02:47.970> over

is just an approximation and evaluating
the<00:02:53.879> height<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.209> your<00:02:54.329> arch<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:55.109> one

that's<00:02:57.900> why<00:02:58.140> having<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.620> professional<00:02:59.220> look<00:02:59.430> at

that's why having a professional look at

that's why having a professional look at
your<00:02:59.730> stride<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:00.569> important
