of<00:00:15.250> them<00:00:15.429> is<00:00:15.639> nicer<00:00:16.240> to<00:00:16.299> drive<00:00:16.450> I<00:00:16.779> driven<00:00:17.349> a

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
of them is nicer to drive I driven a

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.380 
of them is nicer to drive I driven a
horse<00:00:17.860> stable<00:00:18.009> before<00:00:18.220> on<00:00:18.579> the<00:00:18.700> road<00:00:18.820> never<00:00:19.239> on

the<00:00:19.480> circuit<00:00:20.250> she<00:00:21.250> is<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:21.550> brand<00:00:22.210> new

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
the circuit she is a brand new

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.359 
the circuit she is a brand new
experience<00:00:22.779> for<00:00:22.930> me<00:00:22.960> I<00:00:23.200> really<00:00:23.950> love<00:00:24.130> both

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
experience for me I really love both

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.450 
experience for me I really love both
cars<00:00:24.700> and<00:00:25.500> first<00:00:26.500> living<00:00:26.739> the<00:00:26.860> portion<00:00:27.250> it<00:00:27.340> was

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
cars and first living the portion it was

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.609 
cars and first living the portion it was
my<00:00:27.880> favorite<00:00:28.239> car<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.509> all<00:00:28.689> I<00:00:28.930> was<00:00:29.230> amazed<00:00:29.529> with

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
my favorite car of all I was amazed with

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.280 
my favorite car of all I was amazed with
it<00:00:29.739> smells<00:00:30.070> so<00:00:30.160> good<00:00:30.489> in<00:00:30.579> circuit<00:00:30.969> but<00:00:31.419> just<00:00:32.079> a

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
it smells so good in circuit but just a

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.530 
it smells so good in circuit but just a
few<00:00:32.439> flaws<00:00:32.860> because<00:00:33.130> every<00:00:33.940> road<00:00:34.090> car<00:00:34.360> has<00:00:34.510> a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
few flaws because every road car has a

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.040 
few flaws because every road car has a
flaw<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.080> then<00:00:35.740> I<00:00:35.770> went<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.220> driven<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:37.050> GTR

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
flaw and then I went and driven the GTR

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.100 
flaw and then I went and driven the GTR
which<00:00:38.290> was<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.800> very<00:00:39.340> very<00:00:39.550> impressive

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
which was a very very impressive

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
which was a very very impressive
performance<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.290> car<00:00:41.470> three<00:00:42.370> its<00:00:42.520> weight<00:00:42.790> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
performance the car three its weight and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.870 
performance the car three its weight and
all<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.170> characteristics<00:00:44.500> are<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.370> amazing

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
all the characteristics are is amazing

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.110 
all the characteristics are is amazing
car<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.840> rain<00:00:47.020> is<00:00:47.200> a<00:00:47.230> probably<00:00:48.190> put<00:00:48.610> both<00:00:48.820> cars

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
car the rain is a probably put both cars

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.670 
car the rain is a probably put both cars
a<00:00:49.210> bit<00:00:49.329> closer<00:00:49.540> together<00:00:49.780> because<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.560> just

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
a bit closer together because it just

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.230 
a bit closer together because it just
depends<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> bit<00:00:51.130> more<00:00:51.460> on<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.030> tire

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
depends a bit more on the tire

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.120 
depends a bit more on the tire
performance<00:00:52.540> and<00:00:53.140> everything<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.650> think<00:00:53.890> this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
performance and everything I think this

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.650 
performance and everything I think this
GI<00:00:54.460> is<00:00:54.550> probably<00:00:54.820> going<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.000> be<00:00:55.150> a<00:00:55.180> bit<00:00:55.300> quicker

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
GI is probably going to be a bit quicker

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.830 
GI is probably going to be a bit quicker
on<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:55.960> dry<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.460> Porsche<00:00:57.700> on<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:57.940> dry<00:00:58.150> was<00:00:58.810> a

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
on the dry the Porsche on the dry was a

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.780 
on the dry the Porsche on the dry was a
bit<00:00:59.050> just<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.470> this<00:00:59.560> theory<00:00:59.829> in<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.160> West<00:01:00.340> just

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
bit just on this theory in the West just

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.030 
bit just on this theory in the West just
came<00:01:01.329> quite<00:01:01.780> nicely<00:01:02.050> i<00:01:02.260> was<00:01:02.500> impressed<00:01:02.770> how

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
came quite nicely i was impressed how

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.490 
came quite nicely i was impressed how
good<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.370> courses<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.880> wet<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.269> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
good the courses in the wet and the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.110 
good the courses in the wet and the
dejar<00:01:05.500> just<00:01:06.010> started<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.550> light<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.760> little<00:01:06.909> bit

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
dejar just started to light a little bit

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.450 
dejar just started to light a little bit
maybe<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.479> tires<00:01:07.720> are<00:01:08.020> not<00:01:08.890> as<00:01:08.979> good<00:01:09.100> as<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
maybe the tires are not as good as the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.240 
maybe the tires are not as good as the
tires<00:01:10.000> in<00:01:10.120> a<00:01:10.180> Porsche<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.080> it's<00:01:12.040> gonna<00:01:12.159> be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
tires in a Porsche so it's gonna be

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.890 
tires in a Porsche so it's gonna be
interesting<00:01:12.370> to<00:01:12.670> see<00:01:12.760> which<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.450> them<00:01:13.720> goes

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
interesting to see which of them goes

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.719 
interesting to see which of them goes
weekend<00:01:14.260> away<00:01:14.409> my<00:01:15.310> favorite<00:01:15.760> rope<00:01:16.210> car<00:01:16.540> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
weekend away my favorite rope car the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.070 
weekend away my favorite rope car the
probably<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.760> Porsche<00:01:19.060> Turbo<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.900> would<00:01:19.990> be<00:01:20.049> a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
probably a Porsche Turbo that would be a

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.190 
probably a Porsche Turbo that would be a
great<00:01:20.320> car<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:21.280> think<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.240> have<00:01:22.330> good<00:01:22.720> experience

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
great car I think I have good experience

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.170 
great car I think I have good experience
with<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.409> now<00:01:23.560> as<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.070> good<00:01:24.580> need<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.820> see<00:01:25.060> with

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
with it now as a good need to see with

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.060 
with it now as a good need to see with
it<00:01:25.270> now<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:26.290> really<00:01:26.320> really<00:01:26.740> enjoyed<00:01:26.950> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
it now and I really really enjoyed the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.399 
it now and I really really enjoyed the
sky<00:01:27.280> looked<00:01:27.670> great<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.390> smells<00:01:28.750> great<00:01:28.990> inside

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
sky looked great it smells great inside

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.899 
sky looked great it smells great inside
and<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.010> great<00:01:30.159> experience<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.729> great

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
and it's a great experience a great

and it's a great experience a great
engine<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.720> started<00:01:32.080> driving<00:01:32.440> one<00:01:32.530> also<00:01:32.830> five

years old go karts and that was at my
family's<00:01:35.950> farm<00:01:36.190> and

family's farm and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.770 
family's farm and
I<00:01:37.829> did<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.369> about<00:01:39.579> five<00:01:40.149> years<00:01:40.360> never

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
I did it for about five years never

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.480 
I did it for about five years never
really<00:01:41.079> raised<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.680> one<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:41.950> two<00:01:41.979> races

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
really raised that and one of two races

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.410 
really raised that and one of two races
but<00:01:42.700> just<00:01:42.969> fun<00:01:43.600> races<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.880> my<00:01:46.119> uncle's

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
but just fun races and with my uncle's

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.060 
but just fun races and with my uncle's
extent<00:01:46.750> then<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:46.990> had<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.229> stop<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.469> lot<00:01:47.740> sport

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
extent then I had to stop a lot sport

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.249 
extent then I had to stop a lot sport
for<00:01:48.189> my<00:01:48.250> family<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.789> I<00:01:49.479> won't<00:01:49.689> only<00:01:49.899> really

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
for my family and I won't only really

when I went to British form a freak so I

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980 
when I went to British form a freak so I
did<00:01:57.130> two<00:01:57.369> years<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:58.149> get<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.869> learn

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
did two years of that to get to learn

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.319 
did two years of that to get to learn
the<00:01:59.140> basics<00:01:59.500> this<00:01:59.860> year<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.069> mean<00:02:00.399> 52<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.210> my

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
the basics this year I mean 52 it's my

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.209 
the basics this year I mean 52 it's my
second<00:02:01.659> year<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:01.840> GP<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.469> p2<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.740> basically

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
second year in GP to the p2 is basically

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.080 
second year in GP to the p2 is basically
the<00:02:04.140> base<00:02:05.140> perform<00:02:05.590> no<00:02:05.679> one<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.009> where<00:02:06.549> all<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
the base perform no one is where all the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.839 
the base perform no one is where all the
Formula<00:02:07.539> One<00:02:07.630> drivers<00:02:08.080> left<00:02:09.039> has<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.670> have

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
Formula One drivers left has that have

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.520 
Formula One drivers left has that have
come<00:02:10.209> up<00:02:10.269> in<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.690> last<00:02:10.750> three<00:02:11.049> years<00:02:11.200> I've

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
come up in the last three years I've

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.259 
come up in the last three years I've
come<00:02:11.709> from<00:02:11.920> currently<00:02:12.580> I'm<00:02:12.670> would<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.910> sport

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
come from currently I'm would I sport

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.380 
come from currently I'm would I sport
and<00:02:13.540> they<00:02:14.019> are<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.410> me<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.590> best<00:02:14.739> team<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.010> gp2

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and they are for me the best team in gp2

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.850 
and they are for me the best team in gp2
I'm<00:02:16.390> actually<00:02:16.630> what<00:02:17.260> impressed<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:17.650> tango

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
I'm actually what impressed with tango

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.979 
I'm actually what impressed with tango
see<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.220> circuit<00:02:18.549> is<00:02:18.640> mu<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.180> there<00:02:19.780> are<00:02:19.870> some

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
see the circuit is mu and there are some

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.170 
see the circuit is mu and there are some
good<00:02:20.200> corners<00:02:20.590> camber<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.700> curbs<00:02:22.000> are

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
good corners camber and the curbs are

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.110 
good corners camber and the curbs are
well<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.019> place<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.739> think<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.549> good

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
well in place so I think it's a good

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.180 
well in place so I think it's a good
facility<00:02:25.660> for<00:02:25.900> racing<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.410> think<00:02:26.620> with

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
facility for racing I think with

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.650 
facility for racing I think with
single-seaters<00:02:27.819> here<00:02:28.090> will<00:02:28.209> be<00:02:28.329> amazing

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
single-seaters here will be amazing

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.809 
single-seaters here will be amazing
really<00:02:29.260> really<00:02:29.380> quick<00:02:29.650> enjoying<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.579> with

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
really really quick enjoying it with

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.150 
really really quick enjoying it with
these<00:02:30.940> cars<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.720> using<00:02:32.470> long<00:02:32.680> corner<00:02:33.010> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
these cars and just using long corner to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.030 
these cars and just using long corner to
drift<00:02:33.370> around<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.670> little<00:02:33.819> bit<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.299> think<00:02:35.230> my

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
drift around a little bit I think my

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.819 
drift around a little bit I think my
favorite<00:02:36.370> racetrack<00:02:37.090> would<00:02:37.599> be<00:02:37.810> Macau<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.769> a

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
favorite racetrack would be Macau it's a

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.979 
favorite racetrack would be Macau it's a
street<00:02:39.069> circuit<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.360> more

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
street circuit and that is more

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.559 
street circuit and that is more
dangerous<00:02:41.260> than<00:02:41.590> most<00:02:42.160> most<00:02:43.000> difficult<00:02:43.389> to<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
dangerous than most most difficult to a

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.750 
dangerous than most most difficult to a
circuit<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.109> I've<00:02:44.319> ever<00:02:44.380> tried<00:02:44.769> but<00:02:45.519> as<00:02:45.730> a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
circuit that I've ever tried but as a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.640 
circuit that I've ever tried but as a
proper<00:02:46.060> race<00:02:46.209> track<00:02:46.420> i<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:46.720> spa<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
proper race track i think spa is the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.949 
proper race track i think spa is the
place<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:47.889> go<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.780> quite<00:02:49.780> interesting

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
place to go and it's quite interesting

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.250 
place to go and it's quite interesting
to<00:02:50.139> grab<00:02:51.239> looking<00:02:52.239> good<00:02:52.359> for<00:02:52.600> next<00:02:52.810> year<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.170> go

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
to grab looking good for next year to go

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.379 
to grab looking good for next year to go
to<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.440> fund<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.889> i'm<00:02:54.040> from<00:02:54.819> champion<00:02:55.180> i<00:02:55.269> can

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
to a fund if i'm from champion i can

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.020 
to a fund if i'm from champion i can
probably<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:56.069> get<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.130> receipt<00:02:57.819> then

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
probably just get a receipt then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.370 
probably just get a receipt then
hopefully<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.630> competitive<00:02:59.350> one

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.410 

Oh
