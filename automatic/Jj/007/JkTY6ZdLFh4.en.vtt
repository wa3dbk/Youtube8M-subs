00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.150
 Look, let's go, how to be here, I bring you 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 another commented video and a long time ago 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 as more or less a week and half one 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.599
 week a week without uploading videos and now 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.199
 internet know is very wrong in Mexico by 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.329
 the cyclones where I live there is no 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.150
 problem but lines were damaged and so 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.940
 so it's very bad in Mexico or the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.379
 except here where I live is horrible and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.089
 good as we are seeing we are seeing 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.800
 a sunken ship of curiosities that is 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.809
 the new series in gta 5 and we found a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 briefcase with 9,000 and in fact I discovered 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.869
 all this because I was doing the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.680
 mission to find the pieces of a 

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:56.519
 submarine monster sunk and good the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.449
 truth is of these things of mysteries and 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.030
 curiosities is something that the gta 5 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.970
 I like it more and the story follows 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.689
 and online but it's what I like the most 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 because he has one as interests and parents 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.030
 of someone yes everything and you can find 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.190
 many curiosities in this game 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.450
 I just wanted to leave the location 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.299
 of this boat in case you would like 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.830

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.409
 they can find the story 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.140
 comment in the video that something else 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.770
 I could have 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.159
 it was not from anybody right now 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.040
 I told you that it is not was not any 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.680

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.240
 no other video was just 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.310
 doing these missions and I found myself 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.530
 with many curiosities of gta 5 that 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.060
 you could like them I found a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 little more but I started I started 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.840
 record with this and by the way the 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.060
 Sharks do nothing but you 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.130
 around and if you run the approach that is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.140
 if they approach sharks, they run 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 already from the location at the beginning of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 video can come back and see it is a 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.090
 fishing boat dead fishing 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 anyone sunk in the sea in the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.260
