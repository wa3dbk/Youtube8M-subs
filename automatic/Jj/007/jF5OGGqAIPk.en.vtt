00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 guys well this is just hard cant days 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.099
 of to language please fix him 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.519
 see what happens here I am in this 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.469
 moment I see 3 pigeons that are hanging and 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.990
 see for yourself well damn I see get 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.010
 all textures are worked up level i can 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 create very such dirt well it's tough 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.949
 shoals in general actually 10 min not 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 had tried 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.800
 restart the company card and further 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 show you how the shootout do not know 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.850
 than 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 driving on what technique but precisely in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.559
 Multiplayer companies will certainly show 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.860
 there will be the next video wait will 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 today days it's damn it's just 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 terrible why let the game even have 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.190
 enough and even everyone is waiting in the raw 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.489
 still able but in principle 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.739
 multiplayer is no longer raw but 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.449
 well friends you see for yourself the new guy and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.609
 even this but it is impossible friends like so 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.750
 In general, you can release the game further I 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.750
 pass can not call 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.460
 the truth could not get through that door because 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.340
 what seemed and everything and more and more 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.830
 I can do nothing well this video is all 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.860
 it will be the same as I donâ€™t know here 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.850
 look at the chart no you really 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.799
 if so to argue that the graphics 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 very good multiplayer is also very 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:35.350
 good company not something you thank 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.149
 more precisely lags very, very much lags 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.550
 in the mirror i can't see my 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.090
 reflection cons can be attributed 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.649
 Well, in principle, kinov minus and here you are 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.140
 had to add dogs like from 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.069
 trailer and you had to kill more to come 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.100
