thing that they usually point out which

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
thing that they usually point out which
is<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> president<00:00:18.779> wants<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is that you know the president wants to

create this cap and trade system and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.410 
create this cap and trade system and
it's<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> job<00:00:22.680> killer<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.420> it's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
it's going to be a job killer and it's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.750 
it's going to be a job killer and it's
one<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.840> step<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.740> government<00:00:26.189> takeover

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
one more step in the government takeover

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.349 
one more step in the government takeover
of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.269> American<00:00:27.750> economy<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
of the American economy so so this is a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.380 
of the American economy so so this is a
good<00:00:30.599> place<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.439> maybe<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.460> spend<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
good place for me to maybe just spend a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.220 
good place for me to maybe just spend a
little<00:00:33.540> time<00:00:33.649> talking<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:36.020> energy<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
little time talking about it energy and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
little time talking about it energy and
climate<00:00:37.530> change<00:00:37.950> first<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.300> got

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
climate change first of all we just got

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.760 
climate change first of all we just got
five<00:00:39.660> feet<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> snow<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.930> Washington<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
five feet of snow in in Washington and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590 
five feet of snow in in Washington and
so<00:00:43.890> everybody's<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> people

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
so everybody's like a lot of the people

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
so everybody's like a lot of the people
who<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.809> opponents<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.530> climate<00:00:47.190> change<00:00:47.219> they

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
who are opponents of climate change they

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.069 
who are opponents of climate change they
say<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
say see look at that there's all this

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
say see look at that there's all this
snow<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> ground<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.449> doesn't

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
snow on the ground you know this doesn't

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.139 
snow on the ground you know this doesn't
mean<00:00:51.989> anything<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:54.170> want<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.149> want

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
mean anything I want to I want to I want

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.959 
mean anything I want to I want to I want
to<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:58.050> clear<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.340> science<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to just be clear that the science of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
to just be clear that the science of
climate<00:01:00.149> change<00:01:00.449> doesn't<00:01:00.930> mean<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.440> every

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
climate change doesn't mean that every

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.160 
climate change doesn't mean that every
place<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.280> getting<00:01:02.489> warmer<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.690> means<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
place is getting warmer it means the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.890 
place is getting warmer it means the
planet<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> whole<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.280> getting<00:01:05.549> warm<00:01:05.900> but

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
planet as a whole is getting warm but

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.710 
planet as a whole is getting warm but
what<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> may<00:01:07.320> mean<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.920> example

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
what it may mean is for example

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.460 
what it may mean is for example
Vancouver<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.049> supposed<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
Vancouver which is supposed to be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
Vancouver which is supposed to be
getting<00:01:10.590> snowed<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.460> Olympics<00:01:11.960> suddenly

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
getting snowed in the Olympics suddenly

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
getting snowed in the Olympics suddenly
is<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.380> 55<00:01:14.010> degrees<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.930> Dallas<00:01:16.280> suddenly<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
is at 55 degrees and Dallas suddenly is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.260 
is at 55 degrees and Dallas suddenly is
getting<00:01:18.390> seven<00:01:18.869> inches<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.290> snow<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
getting seven inches of snow what the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
getting seven inches of snow what the
idea<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.590> planet<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> whole

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
idea is is that as the planet as a whole

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.539 
idea is is that as the planet as a whole
gets<00:01:24.060> warmer<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:25.049> start<00:01:25.350> seeing<00:01:25.619> changing

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
gets warmer you start seeing changing

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.960 
gets warmer you start seeing changing
weather<00:01:26.759> patterns<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:29.130> creates<00:01:29.640> more

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
weather patterns and that creates more

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.929 
weather patterns and that creates more
violent<00:01:30.600> storm<00:01:31.140> systems<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:32.340> unpredictable

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
violent storm systems more unpredictable

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.560 
violent storm systems more unpredictable
weather<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.710> single<00:01:35.220> place<00:01:35.460> might<00:01:35.790> end<00:01:36.090> up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
weather so any single place might end up

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.410 
weather so any single place might end up
being<00:01:36.930> warmer<00:01:37.740> another<00:01:38.640> place<00:01:38.880> might<00:01:39.150> end<00:01:39.329> up

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
being warmer another place might end up

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
being warmer another place might end up
being<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.229> cooler<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:41.250> might

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
being a little bit cooler there might

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
being a little bit cooler there might
end<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.729> being<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:42.119> precipitation<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
end up being more precipitation in the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.710 
end up being more precipitation in the
air<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.860> monsoons<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.820> hurricanes<00:01:45.030> more

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
air more monsoons more hurricanes more

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.010 
air more monsoons more hurricanes more
tornadoes<00:01:46.850> more<00:01:47.850> droughts<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.750> places

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
tornadoes more droughts in some places

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.100 
tornadoes more droughts in some places
floods<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> other<00:01:50.340> places<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.659> bet

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
floods and other places so I just bet

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.160 
floods and other places so I just bet
that's<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:53.250> aspect<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> science<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that's one aspect of the science that I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.320 
that's one aspect of the science that I
think<00:01:55.439> everybody<00:01:55.799> should<00:01:55.860> understand

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
think everybody should understand

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.390 
think everybody should understand
you
