00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
what is difficult is it because a couple

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.710 
what is difficult is it because a couple
of<00:02:16.340> weeks<00:02:16.549> ago<00:02:16.700> they<00:02:16.970> were<00:02:17.060> saying<00:02:17.269> rain<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.690> a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
of weeks ago they were saying rain in a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.100 
of weeks ago they were saying rain in a
bit

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
bit

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.840 
bit
now<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.440> saying<00:02:18.680> let<00:02:18.799> it<00:02:18.829> go<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> bit<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.549> is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
now the saying let it go a bit it is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.580 
now the saying let it go a bit it is
quite<00:02:20.090> confusing<00:02:20.239> yeah<00:02:20.959> what<00:02:21.140> I'm<00:02:21.290> scared

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
because if I do let go then I think that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.270 
because if I do let go then I think that
what<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> technique<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.769> I'll<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.100> that

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
winter printers and Wednesdays just the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.710 
winter printers and Wednesdays just the
role<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.750> Princess<00:04:31.139> suit<00:04:31.530> Chelsea<00:04:32.040> Pasha<00:04:32.720> well

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
role of Princess suit Chelsea Pasha well

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.690 
role of Princess suit Chelsea Pasha well
I<00:04:33.750> think<00:04:33.990> she's<00:04:34.440> kind<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.800> good<00:04:35.070> at<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.370> role

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
I think she's kind of good at that role

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.670 
I think she's kind of good at that role
because<00:04:35.970> well<00:04:36.600> her<00:04:36.780> mom<00:04:36.990> called<00:04:37.290> her<00:04:37.470> Princess

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
because well her mom called her Princess

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.190 
because well her mom called her Princess
all<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.100> time<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.639> think<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.810> princess<00:04:43.169> is

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
all the time so I think that princess is

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.140 
all the time so I think that princess is
in<00:04:43.350> pretty<00:04:43.590> princess<00:04:43.980> or<00:04:44.130> princess<00:04:44.520> has<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.669> bit

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
in pretty princess or princess has a bit

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.180 
in pretty princess or princess has a bit
of<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.300> Madame<00:04:45.660> no<00:04:46.260> pretty<00:04:46.680> for<00:04:46.830> instance<00:04:47.100> of

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
of a Madame no pretty for instance of

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.220 
of a Madame no pretty for instance of
course<00:04:47.400> which<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.150> quite<00:04:48.419> comfortable<00:04:48.990> there

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
course which is quite comfortable there

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.260 
course which is quite comfortable there
so<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.620> think<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:50.070> dance<00:04:50.340> will<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:50.580> perfect

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270
