you've<00:06:01.440> got<00:06:01.650> your<00:06:03.680> looping<00:06:04.680> so<00:06:04.860> you've<00:06:04.949> got<00:06:05.160> in

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
you've got your looping so you've got in

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.960 
you've got your looping so you've got in
and<00:06:06.270> out<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.870> set<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.110> loop<00:06:07.380> you<00:06:07.650> press<00:06:07.919> in<00:06:08.220> to

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
and out to set a loop you press in to

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.659 
and out to set a loop you press in to
start<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.419> loop<00:06:09.600> and<00:06:09.810> out<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:11.039> end<00:06:11.160> it<00:06:11.370> so

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
start the loop and out to end it so

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.460 
start the loop and out to end it so
let's<00:06:11.940> do<00:06:12.090> is<00:06:12.360> playing<00:06:12.750> that<00:06:12.930> section<00:06:13.350> of

let's do is playing that section of

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.400 
let's do is playing that section of
track<00:06:14.030> once<00:06:15.030> it<00:06:15.210> goes<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.389> the<00:06:15.570> end<00:06:15.599> of<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.229> out
