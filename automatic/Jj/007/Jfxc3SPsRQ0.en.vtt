the way if you guys do not notice i
actually<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:04.849> get<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> 20<00:03:06.109> to<00:03:06.560> kill<00:03:06.829> streak

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
actually do get like a 20 to kill streak

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.770 
actually do get like a 20 to kill streak
and<00:03:07.159> it's<00:03:07.219> telling<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.519> game<00:03:07.699> ends<00:03:08.209> on<00:03:08.389> this

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and it's telling the game ends on this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.390 
and it's telling the game ends on this
gameplay<00:03:09.019> that's<00:03:09.650> why<00:03:09.769> i<00:03:09.799> chose<00:03:09.949> escape<00:03:10.250> i

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
gameplay that's why i chose escape i

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.500 
gameplay that's why i chose escape i
actually<00:03:10.669> just<00:03:10.699> record<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.209> like<00:03:11.359> right

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
actually just record it like right

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.509 
actually just record it like right
before<00:03:11.689> i<00:03:11.840> started<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.379> so<00:03:12.919> i<00:03:12.949> thought<00:03:13.159> makes

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
before i started this so i thought makes

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.649 
before i started this so i thought makes
the<00:03:13.760> gameplay<00:03:14.030> video<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:14.449> is<00:03:14.569> actually

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
the gameplay video so this is actually

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.869 
the gameplay video so this is actually
really<00:03:14.930> good<00:03:15.019> i<00:03:15.169> went<00:03:15.319> 24<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.280> for<00:03:16.819> the

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
really good i went 24 and one for the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.300 
really good i went 24 and one for the
ending<00:03:17.120> score<00:03:17.359> which<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.659> really<00:03:17.840> really<00:03:17.989> nice

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
ending score which is really really nice

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.259 
ending score which is really really nice
but<00:03:19.310> yeah<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:19.699> arguable<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.090> we're

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
but yeah this is arguable that we're

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.249 
but yeah this is arguable that we're
pretty<00:03:20.449> good<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.689> so<00:03:20.870> we're<00:03:20.959> plugging<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.199> be
