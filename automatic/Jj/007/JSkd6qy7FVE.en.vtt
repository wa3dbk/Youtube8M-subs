00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 Talk to your grandson here. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.660
 ok let's continue a deaf neither like me 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 promised is the last part of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 class is confused with the last phase of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.550
 world 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.320
 So I'm going to make this stage here, right now. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.529
 continue the sequence of videos showing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.539
 all the boats and I'm already doing it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.140
 last part of the knight's success 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.200
 thinking that once this 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.250
 Phase is just to kill the boss, right? 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.910
 It's just killing the boss. 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 today I'm going to leave as a knight who 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.379
 This phase is very simple. 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.320
 she does not have much room 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.050
 a lot they do is something that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 Some pats have denied the type they have Paul 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 here is that paul 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 in fact who will replace the boss and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.630
 will also have the following she is well 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.330
 This phase is long because we are 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 entering castle then you have these 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.150
 matches are outside the walls around 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 castle and will have a part either inside 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 of the castle tower you see own 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 that the environment is one of the purchases 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.580
 They do this but it's really cool to see, huh? 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.140
 with which the game begins to evolve and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.180
 will be a little bigger also by 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 the last stage of alber, then to have 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 a bit more difficult but the boss 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.009
 It's quiet, the quiet sub- clerk, I'm 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.960
 with a good group here is also 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.939
 killing until fast, right? 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.240
 I think they would have arisen is doing the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.659
 test class also the guild is also 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.829
 doing a test drive 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.430
 I've done my two training is both 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.700
 them to scold the scenery while the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.180
 of the abyss is not one that has 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.880
 have online 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.030
 my staff there Wednesday when it was 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.869
 launch and already got another 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.150
 thing now this weekend is 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.360
 to enjoy the event of infinite vigor, right? 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.400
 I enjoyed the talent prize then, but the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 game I 'll just use it a little more 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.959
 ahead do not judge for now 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.390
 which will continue what I arises 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.720
 show a little of the light swordsman 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.320
 arcane and with hayden as you asked 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.090
 huh 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.420
 I'll do the following I go in the series 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.550
 I'm going to use the mercenary swordsman who 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 it would be equivalent to the Rider and 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.020
 list is that it is more focused on attacks 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.600
 magical attack while the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.270
 The hotel's arcing knight appears to be 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.810
 more focused on the magical attack is the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.980
 abilities he has giving margin the damage 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.400
 physical I do not know why not one hour 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.270
 wrong but the damage makes the difference that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.769
 his ability is focused on giving more 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.570
 beauty are passing here the phase as 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.780
 I said just got inside the tower 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.209
 castle also in this change of 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:27.190
 environment so much like a 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:28.150
 part of the sewage does not resemble a 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.049
 Sewer 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:39.130
 but this thing is half dark and a half 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:44.739
 It's a very easy cave there. 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:48.010
 also had difficulty with two teams in the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.709
 group had no way of getting difficult is that 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.049
 enem is far behind very expensive 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.180
 cells only in a spared 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.750
 proves the staff of brown each 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.220
 I know it's very strong mainly 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:10.120
 in me is a chef catch is a skill 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.620
 the mass was already the most part as 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.260
 great to have one more part here 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.870
 inside or will leave 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:22.000
 the Deputy Chief of Staff 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.210
 I'm going to head to the head straight out. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.400
 following I'll skip a little 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.740
 here it is because I know the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.110
 people have a running craze to kill the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.250
 First Deputy Chief I do not know why he has 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.669
 time to mania 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.440
 As I said, it only disturbs 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.710
 11 minutes ago someone has to 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.050
 stay to kill the time to show 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:53.710
 you 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:57.610
 I'm going to run after the guy and the 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.680
 difference I do not understand why they do this 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.320
 because it makes no difference if you kill 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:09.790
 first the the object will not earn more 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.919
 experience and 3424 globe is depending 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.250
 who to kill or just the guy they are 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.050
 fuck and run ahead so i know that 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.590
 this will happen because you always have a 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.810
 stupid to do that then only with the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.570
 boss out in the video the deputy chief is in the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.610
 video you see that is knowing 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.430
 It's not the stage that 's looking at there. 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.110
 put the game then you have to do this 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.540
 to try to regain life no one 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.889
 wants to walk 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.760
 no one to walk to recover the 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:44.010
 I'll tell you what, 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.010
 wanted to get out in the front and back then 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.600
 awakened we also know that in 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.919
 certain time there to do this truth is that 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.130
 very crazy 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.139
 it was pretty cool design is likely to 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.150
 they'll kill the deputy chief all this rest 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.300
 of staff who are more aware 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.100
 Congratulations to you are here is aware 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.400
 You know you have to kill the year enemies. 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.970
 bearing fruit 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.610
 the enemy of the earth is bound are 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.930
 good players do not like staying here but 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.810
 thank you 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.210
 and he was already a clean sub- boss right now 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.030
 Let's go to the boss, it's going to be very easy. 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.620
 fast even more with a group so goes 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.449
 more like this 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.740
 only he is the first robot boss who 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.979
 appears in the game right 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.250
 o the first chef mechanics are the new 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:35.650
 lots will take us as we go 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:40.520
 facing next next but 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:43.150
 Come on, there's no problem for the 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.150
 two attacks 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:50.139
 The attack from the wrong side is fine. 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:53.740
 finished this special of the king very expensive of the 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:58.970
 of the explosion is plucking many chefs 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:05.780
 combined with 2 to arise kan was already 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:07.550
 This is it, people liked to comment 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.539

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.669
 from class 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:01.610
