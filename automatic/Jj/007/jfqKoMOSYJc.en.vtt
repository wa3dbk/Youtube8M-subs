00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 friends hello in this video I will tell 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 I do play the instrument 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.889
 usually it's in the morning why because it's 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 always fresh head 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 say your body is fresh hands for me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.830
 the most beneficial is when I am for him and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.880
 court is not evening 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 how it all happens differently so 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.750
 let's start art is not a sport 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.940
 but the musician in particular is no pianist 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
 need to play with the athlete's boyfriend 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 before the relay 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.070
 different so to say your fingers in your 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 I spent a lot of time 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.559
 finger strengths of their independence and for 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.039
 I used this textbook in French 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.350
 Methodist aha but gangan he is his name 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.840
 It sounds like Charles Louis 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.730
 anon volga nn he's under somehow here in 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.460
 Russia took root and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.870
 and even on Rahmani all the time mentioned that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.630
 than institutions are very often used 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.390
 these exercises so here and then 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.050
 learned many leaf exercises 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.160
 johnny chopin 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.800
 Many virtuosos have no oil of the century and played 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.570
 then everything needs literally 3 hours 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.720
 on the day of the development of fluency fingers 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.370
 then somehow I polished it all up and shock 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.370
 for myself now the most necessary 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.530
 exercises that play almost 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.230
 every day and it takes literally 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.840
 probably minutes 20 maybe 30 max 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.780
 but the rest of the time I study 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.180
 literature notes and program for 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 concerts and so on than many of 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.800
 exercise gonad play a few 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.410
 configurations for slow tempo 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.270
 why because more fingers sleep arm 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.210
 you must somehow not too 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.210
 strain and now I will tell you 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.320
 if your hands are tired you must 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.560
 rest sit 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.150
 shake hands and take your time 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.260
 goes with me exercise sheet calling him 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.260
 drinking and folding 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.000
 also play war and turkey and sex 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.549
 and around 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.120
 rehearsal is also very important 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.720
 as they are common 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.720
 Franz Liszt and many virtuosos of the 19th century 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.100
 also I advise you to play 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.390
 octaves as decomposed as usual 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.020
 and you have to play all 24 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.440
 tonalities 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.319
 It seems this exercise I saw in the same 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.800
 canon since our prop is the first 5 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.050
 fingers 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.050
 it is necessary to pour 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.490
 but 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.750
 and in the end I like to play exercises 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.900
 so interesting it fits 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.130
 posing hands put 5 fingers on 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.870
 keys white 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.640
 this is our support and black in the middle 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.620
 it produces police independence 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.720
 I'll show you now, but I have to be 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.730
 neat your time 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.500
 noise he hurt his hands with his hands 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.900
 Any such exercises seem to be 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.500
 this exercise came from the noise of us also 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.020
 their time pianist cut themselves 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.990
 membranes between fingers like this 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.780
 gave kind of like lengthened hell size 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.500
 fingers and make independent 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.870
 I also thought about it but changed my mind 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.550
 suddenly something to be damaged 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.220
 here 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.950
 I will say so is not important 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.770
 hand and finger size 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.640
 to use 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.640
 step by step first 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.750
 you 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.750
 but 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.630
 but 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.979
 and at the end of course I will add that you 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.270
 need to copy all the ideal about 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.390
 the treasury everyone must all and find 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.990
 I found them to myself that the load is fucking 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.020
 good luck everybody be sure of yourself and your 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.020
 the strength
