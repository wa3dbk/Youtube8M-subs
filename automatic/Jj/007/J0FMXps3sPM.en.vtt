00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
in the sense that it opens from the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
in the sense that it opens from the
bottom<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.270> adjusts

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bottom but it actually adjusts

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
bottom but it actually adjusts
differently<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.920> hand<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> my

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
friend here to demonstrate so as you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
friend here to demonstrate so as you
open<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> doors<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.660> notice<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.440> open<00:01:01.710> just

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
open the doors you notice they open just

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
open the doors you notice they open just
like<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> regular<00:01:02.250> adjustable<00:01:03.030> Fat<00:01:03.899> Boy<00:01:04.080> does

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like a regular adjustable Fat Boy does

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
like a regular adjustable Fat Boy does
but<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> turn<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.659> adjustment<00:01:06.659> knob

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but as you turn the adjustment knob

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.730 
but as you turn the adjustment knob
you'll<00:01:07.680> notice<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.820> entire<00:01:09.740> bottom

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you'll notice that the entire bottom

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
you'll notice that the entire bottom
base<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> razor<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.900> moves

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
base of the razor is actually what moves

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.420 
base of the razor is actually what moves
up<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:14.090> as<00:01:15.090> opposed<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.990> later

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
up and down as opposed to the later

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.940 
up and down as opposed to the later
razors<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.909> use<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:19.020> areas<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
razors that just use for areas of the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
razors that just use for areas of the
razor<00:01:20.159> plate<00:01:21.060> bottom<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> move<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> down

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
razor plate bottom to move up and down

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.490 
razor plate bottom to move up and down
so<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.710> functions<00:01:23.340> differently<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
so it functions differently so that is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.620 
so it functions differently so that is
definitely<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> most<00:01:26.729> rare<00:01:27.090> Gillette
