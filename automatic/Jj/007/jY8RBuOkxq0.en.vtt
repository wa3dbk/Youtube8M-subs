this is my board flip and kickflip you

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.890 
this is my board flip and kickflip you
can<00:00:15.920> use<00:00:16.040> three<00:00:16.280> fingers<00:00:16.309> or<00:00:16.940> two<00:00:17.180> fingers<00:00:17.660> to

fingers delay Island I think three

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.090 
fingers delay Island I think three
fingers<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.029> also<00:00:23.300> pretty<00:00:23.480> easy<00:00:23.779> to<00:00:24.050> take<00:00:24.950> a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
fingers is also pretty easy to take a

flip you for three fingers put a finger

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.310 
flip you for three fingers put a finger
right<00:00:28.790> here<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.480> right<00:00:29.510> here<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.020> then<00:00:30.110> put<00:00:30.290> a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
finger in the middle and then go like

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.840 
finger in the middle and then go like
that<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:33.680> when<00:00:34.040> you<00:00:34.100> feel<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.400> controlling

the<00:00:34.879> board<00:00:35.120> there<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.270> kickflip<00:00:35.720> it's<00:00:36.020> going<00:00:36.170> to

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
the board there a kickflip it's going to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.070 
the board there a kickflip it's going to
look<00:00:36.379> like<00:00:36.410> a<00:00:36.620> crystal<00:00:37.489> Kirby<00:00:37.760> mess<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:38.960> you

look like a crystal Kirby mess and you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.310 
look like a crystal Kirby mess and you
get<00:00:39.230> two<00:00:39.410> fingers<00:00:40.449> put<00:00:41.449> one<00:00:41.600> finger<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:42.110> here

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
get two fingers put one finger in here

one<00:00:42.559> finger<00:00:43.250> here<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.750> within<00:00:44.750> those<00:00:44.989> two

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
one finger here and within those two

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.619 
one finger here and within those two
fingers<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.620> want<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.890> pop<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.629> lightly

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
like that but in the middle and

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.680 
like that but in the middle and
fascination<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.839> wasn't<00:00:59.839> possible<00:01:00.050> sorry

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
fascination that wasn't possible sorry

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.509 
fascination that wasn't possible sorry
that's<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.809> cake<00:01:03.019> because<00:01:03.739> we<00:01:03.949> can<00:01:04.100> see<00:01:04.309> how<00:01:04.460> you

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
that's a cake because we can see how you

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.280 
that's a cake because we can see how you
split<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.830> like<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.040> i<00:01:07.100> lost<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.549> board

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
split it like that i lost the board

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.950 
split it like that i lost the board
click<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.470> like<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.390> when<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.659> flick<00:01:11.930> it

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
click it like that and when you flick it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.320 
click it like that and when you flick it
it<00:01:12.770> will<00:01:12.920> be<00:01:13.010> either<00:01:13.159> go<00:01:13.370> like<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.090> when

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
it will be either go like this and when

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.139 
it will be either go like this and when
you<00:01:14.390> get<00:01:14.540> really<00:01:14.659> skilled<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.170> can<00:01:15.320> do

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
you get really skilled you can do

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.149 
you get really skilled you can do
turtles<00:01:18.789> singles<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.090> then<00:01:21.100> hopefully<00:01:22.100> you

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
turtles singles and then hopefully you

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.840 
turtles singles and then hopefully you
can<00:01:22.280> do<00:01:22.399> some<00:01:22.640> cereals<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.899> some<00:01:24.520> train<00:01:25.520> clips

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
can do some cereals and some train clips

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.690 
can do some cereals and some train clips
but<00:01:26.530> ok<00:01:27.530> folks<00:01:27.710> are<00:01:27.859> kind<00:01:28.039> of<00:01:28.100> tricky<00:01:28.399> at<00:01:28.579> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
but ok folks are kind of tricky at the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.679 
but ok folks are kind of tricky at the
beginning<00:01:29.030> because<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.390> don't<00:01:29.570> know<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
beginning because you don't know the

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.569 
beginning because you don't know the
leaving<00:01:29.990> sometimes<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.100> know<00:01:31.130> difference

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
leaving sometimes you know difference

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.209 
leaving sometimes you know difference
between<00:01:31.609> heel<00:01:32.000> flips<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.359> kick<00:01:32.539> flips

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
between heel flips and kick flips

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.770 
between heel flips and kick flips
kickflips<00:01:34.219> go<00:01:34.719> this<00:01:35.719> way<00:01:35.990> like<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:38.090> coquille

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
kickflips go this way like this coquille

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.039 
kickflips go this way like this coquille
flips<00:01:39.079> go<00:01:39.320> inward<00:01:39.829> like<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.340> I'm<00:01:41.329> the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
flips go inward like that I'm the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.920 
flips go inward like that I'm the
beginning<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:42.560> started<00:01:42.829> playing<00:01:42.979> xxxx

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
beginning I started playing xxxx

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.390 
beginning I started playing xxxx
I<00:01:43.960> didn't<00:01:44.200> know<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.590> difference<00:01:44.890> he'll<00:01:45.220> come

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
I didn't know the difference he'll come

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.610 
I didn't know the difference he'll come
and<00:01:45.520> kick<00:01:45.700> with<00:01:45.940> but<00:01:46.720> this<00:01:46.870> is<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.170> kickflip

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
and kick with but this is the kickflip

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.320 
and kick with but this is the kickflip
because<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.130> pops<00:01:48.520> like<00:01:48.730> this<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.270> is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
because it pops like this and this is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.790 
because it pops like this and this is
the<00:01:49.540> heel<00:01:49.780> flip<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.500> pops<00:01:50.800> that<00:01:51.460> way<00:01:51.730> so

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
the heel flip and pops that way so

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.110 
the heel flip and pops that way so
something<00:01:53.800> like<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.730> kickflip

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
something like that this is the kickflip

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.310 
something like that this is the kickflip
and<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.979> get<00:01:57.100> really<00:01:57.250> advanced

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and when you get really advanced

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.730 
and when you get really advanced
sometimes<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.500> can<00:01:59.650> pick<00:02:00.330> boards<00:02:01.590> times<00:02:02.590> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
sometimes you can pick boards times you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.859 
sometimes you can pick boards times you
can<00:02:02.920> kick<00:02:03.100> flip<00:02:05.040> over<00:02:06.040> rails<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.289> rails<00:02:09.869> or

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
can kick flip over rails on the rails or

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.820 
can kick flip over rails on the rails or
impossible<00:02:11.470> over<00:02:12.240> all<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.510> stuff<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:15.130> then

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
impossible over all that stuff and then

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.650 
impossible over all that stuff and then
kickflip<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.670> my<00:02:18.790> favorite<00:02:19.150> trips<00:02:19.420> and
