00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.280
 follow our direct coverage of the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.170
 vegas 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
 with so many cool products at the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.310
 It 's just one that has lots of money to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
 able to buy and carry various gadgets 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.930
 to home plus one in particular is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.050
 calling attention enough of who passes 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.090
 here at the intel booth is the dell xps 13 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 and if the work is small for 13 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.260
 inch stands out amid other 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 large planes for some reasons 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.480
 the screen that screen resolution to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 almost four cars are 3.200 per thousand 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 800 pixels 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 this causes everything displayed on it to be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 so defined that the size almost 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 It matters that you can read up to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 little ones and look who they are already walking 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 Complaining a little of the age has 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 plus the edge of only 5.2mm 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 this makes him the smallest work with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.250
 13 inch screen in the world 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.409
 in practice it is the size of notebooks 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.510
 11 inches but how the screen fits 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 almost all the surface we have to this 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.500
 I gained this super edge technology 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 in other books was developed 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.150
 by the sharp and exclusive dell to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.680
 August then it is to be expected that other 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.960
 manufacturers run after this novelty 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 monitor and tati support up to 10 rings 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 in the brain since 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.280
 Little is the supercore 75 5 001 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.140

 aluminum and it weighs one pound 270 grams 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 beauty in the United States in 1899 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.189
