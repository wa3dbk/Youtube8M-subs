00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
I'm going to start by positioning my

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.979 
I'm going to start by positioning my
eyes<00:02:28.800> marking<00:02:29.800> out<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.190> two<00:02:30.400> little<00:02:30.670> dots

giving<00:02:32.010> nice<00:02:33.010> sweeping<00:02:33.880> shapes<00:02:37.110> now<00:02:38.110> because

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
giving nice sweeping shapes now because

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.530 
giving nice sweeping shapes now because
you're<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.160> paint<00:02:39.400> with<00:02:39.549> acrylic<00:02:40.000> onto

this<00:02:40.690> plate<00:02:41.019> afterwards

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
this plate afterwards

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.199 
this plate afterwards
it<00:02:41.980> doesn't<00:02:42.340> matter<00:02:42.519> if<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.820> get<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> little

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
it doesn't matter if you get a little

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.390 
it doesn't matter if you get a little
bit<00:02:43.480> messy<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.440> try<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.769> keep<00:02:45.070> everything

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
bit messy just try and keep everything

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.930 
bit messy just try and keep everything
symmetrical<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> face<00:02:47.170> tends<00:02:47.530> to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
symmetrical because the face tends to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.640 
symmetrical because the face tends to
show<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> pattern<00:02:49.330> that's<00:02:49.750> exactly<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.380> same

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
show a pattern that's exactly the same

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.490 
show a pattern that's exactly the same
on<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.190> side<00:02:51.459> as<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> other<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.239> had<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> look

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
on one side as the other I had a look

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.979 
on one side as the other I had a look
online<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.330> found<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.510> there<00:02:55.630> were<00:02:55.720> quite<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
online and found that there were quite a

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.560 
online and found that there were quite a
few<00:02:56.110> different<00:02:56.650> styles<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.220> Chinese<00:02:57.570> masks

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
few different styles of Chinese masks

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.140 
few different styles of Chinese masks
they<00:02:59.080> all<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.410> different<00:02:59.440> meanings<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.910> I'd

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
they all have different meanings but I'd

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.449 
they all have different meanings but I'd
say<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.750> take<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.140> flavor<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.769> what<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.220> like

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
say just take a flavor of what you like

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.979 
say just take a flavor of what you like
out<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.850> them<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.209> colors<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.959> shapes

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
out of them the colors and the shapes

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.910 
out of them the colors and the shapes
and<00:03:05.620> then<00:03:05.890> create<00:03:06.670> your<00:03:06.700> own<00:03:06.880> face<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
and then create your own face so the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.140 
and then create your own face so the
only<00:03:09.070> thing<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.519> consider<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:10.120> that

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
only thing to consider is that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.270 
only thing to consider is that
everything<00:03:10.780> has<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.080> stay<00:03:11.260> quite<00:03:11.560> symmetrical

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
everything has to stay quite symmetrical

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.500 
everything has to stay quite symmetrical
matching<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:13.060> both<00:03:13.299> sides<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:15.040> let's<00:03:15.640> see<00:03:16.000> I'm

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
matching on both sides so let's see I'm

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.600 
matching on both sides so let's see I'm
going<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.750> start<00:03:17.049> off<00:03:17.230> by<00:03:17.260> doing<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:18.100> side<00:03:18.430> of

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
going to start off by doing one side of

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.580 
going to start off by doing one side of
the<00:03:18.730> face<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.239> then<00:03:19.750> I'm<00:03:19.930> going<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.110> work<00:03:20.350> back

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the face and then I'm going to work back

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:42.460 
the face and then I'm going to work back
and<00:03:20.860> create<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> other<00:03:21.579> side

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.280 

so<00:03:43.470> once<00:03:44.310> you've<00:03:44.550> got<00:03:44.819> your<00:03:44.849> mask<00:03:45.300> pretty<00:03:46.050> much

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
so once you've got your mask pretty much

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.680 
so once you've got your mask pretty much
sketched<00:03:46.739> out<00:03:47.069> it's<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:48.150> question<00:03:48.330> of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
sketched out it's just a question of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.559 
sketched out it's just a question of
getting<00:03:48.810> hold<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.290> some<00:03:49.530> paint<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.569> painting

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
getting hold of some paint and painting

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.479 
getting hold of some paint and painting
it<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.870> until<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.500> end<00:03:52.800> up<00:03:53.010> with<00:03:53.220> something

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
it in until you end up with something

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.510 
it in until you end up with something
that<00:03:53.940> looks<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.300> little<00:03:54.480> bit<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:59.340> as

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
that looks a little bit like this now as

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.120 
that looks a little bit like this now as
you<00:03:59.730> can<00:03:59.880> see<00:03:59.940> we've<00:04:00.870> taken<00:04:01.170> our<00:04:01.440> scissors<00:04:01.860> and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
you can see we've taken our scissors and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.860 
you can see we've taken our scissors and
just<00:04:02.160> cut<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.640> little<00:04:02.970> bit<00:04:03.090> more<00:04:03.239> of<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.630> shape

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
just cut a little bit more of a shape

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.290 
just cut a little bit more of a shape
into<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.380> crown<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.940> make<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.270> eye

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
into that crown and then to make the eye

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.600 
into that crown and then to make the eye
holes<00:04:06.810> all<00:04:07.050> you've<00:04:07.350> got<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.680> do<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.069> stab

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
holes all you've got to do is stab

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.660 
holes all you've got to do is stab
through<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> plate<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:10.010> clip<00:04:11.010> away<00:04:11.310> with

through the plate and clip away with
your<00:04:11.819> scissors<00:04:12.030> until<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.780> can<00:04:12.959> get<00:04:13.110> these

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
your scissors until you can get these

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.640 
your scissors until you can get these
small<00:04:13.680> eye<00:04:13.890> holes<00:04:14.190> cut<00:04:14.459> out<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.880> then<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.900> bent

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.350 
into the bottom like so just so that I
could<00:04:22.560> get<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.130> cut<00:04:23.580> away<00:04:23.729> at<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.090> nose

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
I've taken two pipe cleaners I bend them

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.820 
I've taken two pipe cleaners I bend them
in<00:04:38.160> half<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.700> leave<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:39.510> little<00:04:39.960> bit<00:04:40.110> more<00:04:40.380> at<00:04:40.620> one

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
in half I leave a little bit more at one

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.430 
in half I leave a little bit more at one
in<00:04:41.010> then<00:04:41.190> another<00:04:41.330> just<00:04:42.330> twist<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:43.050> together

until you get a nice flat shape at the
top<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.970> leave<00:04:48.150> yourself<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.720> bit<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.140> loop

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
top and leave yourself a bit of a loop

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.100 
top and leave yourself a bit of a loop
so<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:50.039> stick<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.460> down<00:04:51.110> once

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
so that you can stick it down once

that's twisted it's ready to be glued
onto<00:04:54.870> your<00:04:55.320> mask<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.580> give<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.789> as

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
onto your mask and you can give it as

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.500 
onto your mask and you can give it as
much<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.810> curl<00:04:58.110> as<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.440> like<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:02.419> using<00:05:03.419> a

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
much of a curl as you like so using a

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.640 
much of a curl as you like so using a
little<00:05:03.720> bit<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:04.080> PVA

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
little bit of PVA

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.850 
little bit of PVA
I<00:05:04.890> attached<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.120> onto<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.600> mask<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.620> wait

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
I attached that onto the mask and wait

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.670 
I attached that onto the mask and wait
for<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.310> dry<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.820> then<00:05:09.600> once<00:05:10.350> you've<00:05:10.650> got

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
for it to dry and then once you've got

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.159 
for it to dry and then once you've got
two<00:05:11.100> glued<00:05:11.460> on<00:05:11.669> it's<00:05:12.360> just<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.660> question<00:05:12.840> of

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
two glued on it's just a question of

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.380 
two glued on it's just a question of
turning<00:05:13.740> your<00:05:13.860> mask<00:05:14.070> around<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.210> can

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
turning your mask around so that you can

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.920 
turning your mask around so that you can
attach<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.050> your<00:05:16.080> face<00:05:17.570> using<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.660> bit<00:05:18.810> of

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
attach it to your face using a bit of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.240 
attach it to your face using a bit of
string<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.820> a<00:05:20.820> stapling<00:05:21.620> just<00:05:22.620> take<00:05:22.890> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
string and a stapling just take the
