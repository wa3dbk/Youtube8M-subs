00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello today amigurumi universe presents you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.510
 the regular show characters are 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.620
 it's about mordecai and mordecai is a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.400
 blue jay a bird as you see 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.930
 and I received a raccoon we have love from each 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 and that I almost do not fit in the plane 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.520
 keep being a character 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.250
 quite complex to do has many 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.789
 parts and I have used many techniques 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.719
 different 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.059
 for example the eyes are made of felt but 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.730
 the pupil I made with black wool with 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.850
 two stitches of wool 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.320
 to get that effect because if 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.480
 cutting filter so tiny because I was going 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.030
 to be very complicated to sew it so 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.180
 because with a little bit of wool you go to the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.350
 step after the head has several 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.519
 parts 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 the peaks go apart the head itself is 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.129
 the sphere and as you see has different 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.979
 colors I do not know if it distinguishes very well 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.770
 has a very clear blue this is 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 very dark blue and then a blue and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.649
 half above how you get this 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.630
 good effect because simply custom 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.850
 what are you doing the sphere the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 you go around, you're just changing 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.369
 the wool does not need to cut or that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.590
 you auction it so you can keep changing 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.720
 one thread to another if if you care 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.990
 that is not too tense because you can 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.909
 do directly 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 and then for the drawing because nothing 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.270
 a little patience every turn 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.020
 Well, you are making here increase here 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.759
 decrease in order 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.650
 It is to have a little patience and 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.570
 practice 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.150
 the peak are triangles has to the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.280
 detail of the nose 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.820
 the body is an oval 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 but 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.970
 behind as the body is light blue 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.220
 from behind I have put this blue 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.220
 because the back has it in this color 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.130
 for each tail feather has two 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.709
 parts and as you can see then there is also 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 change wool to make the rings and 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.560
 then the wings go apart finished in 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.040
 peaks to make fingers or feathers 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.500
 as you want also have change of 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.450
 color to make the lines 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.880
 and the legs for the lure with a 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.640
 rectangle and then bending the to the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.550
 half and sewing it as I have already commented 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.310
 the legs have wire inside for 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.190
 that stay that way more straight do not lose 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.560
 mobility can sit on the floor but if 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.260
 you want to have the doll stand up like this 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 supported to have it on a shelf or 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.300
 whatever is 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.270
 It will be much better to see them 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 straight and then the fingers 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.210
 they both have no more 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.600
 more than anything, I've put wire because 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.360
 because they were so long, they bent a lot 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.760
 more if it's something shorter like the fingers 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.590
 or if it is not necessary but to be so 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.420
 long and what 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.180
 so the first one I made the body 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.489
 then the tummy is sewn on 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.890
 body and when we make the nose 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.180
 you have to look at sewing it so that 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.439
 match you see the color 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.439
 to make it better 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.390
 and the little fingers of the feet 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.550
 be 5 being the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.209
 so it's good to give them that 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.740
 round shape to the tail there is also 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.300
 to give it this shape with a few 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.360
 Stitches 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.770
 and the rings, I made them to measure 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.830
 I was doing the tail that starts 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.600
 here with a magic ring I'm going 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.050
 changing wool for a few 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.970
 turns to make the rings 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.830
 the snout has the two parts that 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.350
 does with two triangles and then at 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.480
 sew it and fill it in because it's already given 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.130
 this rounded shape but they really are 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.510
 two normal triangles 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.980
 and good hands can be done 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.130
 when the usually very narrow and 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.709
 do by making a rectangle and then what 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.530
 fold in half I sew it and then 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.270
 the redondito is already in that way 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.090
 legs I made them from ring 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.010
 magical are a little wide 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.230
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.230
 in the next video chao chao
