00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
cream that I'm using and the reason why

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
cream that I'm using and the reason why
I<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.739> BB<00:00:53.010> cream<00:00:53.190> over<00:00:53.460> foundation<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I like BB cream over foundation is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.439 
I like BB cream over foundation is
because<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.629> light<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.440> has<00:00:55.590> SPF<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
because it's light and it has SPF so you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
because it's light and it has SPF so you
don't<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> put<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.960> sunscreen<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.070> I'm

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
don't have to put on sunscreen so I'm

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.670 
don't have to put on sunscreen so I'm
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.579> squirting<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> onto<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.289> CD

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
going to be squirting that onto the CD

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.349 
going to be squirting that onto the CD
and<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> reason<00:01:02.460> why<00:01:02.579> I'm<00:01:02.699> doing<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.969> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and the reason why I'm doing this is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.469 
and the reason why I'm doing this is
because<00:01:04.129> CDs<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.790> good<00:01:06.060> makeup

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
because CDs are really good makeup

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
because CDs are really good makeup
palettes<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.950> blend<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.460> of
