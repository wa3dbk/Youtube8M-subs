00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
like 200 and anywhere probably anywhere

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
like 200 and anywhere probably anywhere
from<00:00:57.420> 200<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.230> 20<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> huge

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
from 200 like 20 to so not a huge

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
from 200 like 20 to so not a huge
fluctuation<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> weight<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.590> been

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
fluctuation of weight but I have been

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
fluctuation of weight but I have been
hitting<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> same<00:01:02.969> macros<00:01:03.480> overall<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.049> the

gym<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:05.250> hasn't<00:01:05.850> been<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.150> best<00:01:06.180> experience

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
gym it hasn't been the best experience

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
implementing that in again so right now

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.550 
implementing that in again so right now
I've<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.540> been<00:01:57.780> doing<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.259> three

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
I've just been doing it about three

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
I've just been doing it about three
times<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.920> week<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:59.610> strength<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.420> hasn't

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
times a week my strength really hasn't

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.830 
times a week my strength really hasn't
gone<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.079> too<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.299> while<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.630> been

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
gone up too much and while I have been

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
gone up too much and while I have been
doing<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.350> little<00:02:04.619> more<00:02:04.890> volume<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> less

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
doing a little more volume and less

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.749 
doing a little more volume and less
frequency<00:02:06.689> since<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.619> more<00:02:08.250> focused<00:02:08.429> on

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
frequency since I was more focused on

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
frequency since I was more focused on
strength<00:02:09.119> before<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:09.869> I'm<00:02:10.050> kind<00:02:10.560> of

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
strength before but now I'm kind of

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.660 
strength before but now I'm kind of
doing<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.979> little<00:02:11.160> more<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
doing a little more of a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.809 
doing a little more of a
hybrid<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.330> am<00:02:12.709> feeling<00:02:13.709> better<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.430> far<00:02:14.670> as

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
hybrid I am feeling better as far as

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.620 
hybrid I am feeling better as far as
getting<00:02:15.030> through<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> workout<00:02:15.920> but

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
getting through a workout but

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.870 
getting through a workout but
individually<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.900> set<00:02:19.290> I'm<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:20.130> feeling<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
individually on set I'm not feeling the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.800 
individually on set I'm not feeling the
strength<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:22.230> before<00:02:22.440> at<00:02:22.860> least

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
strength that I was before at least

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.630 
strength that I was before at least
moving<00:02:24.810> up<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.200> wait<00:02:25.440> consistently<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
moving up and wait consistently so that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.070 
moving up and wait consistently so that
is<00:02:26.790> something<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.209> thought<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> reports<00:02:27.959> you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
is something I thought I reports you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.260 
is something I thought I reports you
guys<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.590> keep<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.280> mind<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.700> there<00:02:30.090> are

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
guys but keep in mind that there are

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.360 
guys but keep in mind that there are
varying<00:02:30.810> factors<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.650> into<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:32.100> I've

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
varying factors that go into that I've

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.729 
varying factors that go into that I've
been<00:02:32.550> really<00:02:32.730> busy<00:02:32.989> especially<00:02:33.989> physically

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
been really busy especially physically

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.010 
been really busy especially physically
compared<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> was<00:02:36.300> from<00:02:36.660> when<00:02:36.989> I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
compared to what I was from when I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.830 
compared to what I was from when I
started<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.550> still<00:02:38.730> eating<00:02:39.030> meat<00:02:39.600> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
started and I was still eating meat and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.190 
started and I was still eating meat and
dairy<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.769> i<00:02:41.700> had<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.540> same<00:02:42.569> macros

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.620 
dairy and all that i had the same macros
then<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.650> i<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.430> i'm<00:02:44.489> still<00:02:44.760> hitting

then as i do now so i'm still hitting

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.710 
then as i do now so i'm still hitting
them<00:02:45.870> exactly<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.890> same<00:02:47.100> for<00:02:47.580> protein<00:02:48.180> which

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
was suggested to me so it's by Sun

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.729 
was suggested to me so it's by Sun
warrior<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.390> said<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.750> classic<00:03:10.260> protein

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
warrior like I said it's classic protein

warrior like I said it's classic protein
sprouted<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.730> fermented<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.630> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
sprouted and fermented and this is the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.680 
sprouted and fermented and this is the
natural<00:03:12.989> flavor<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.209> guys<00:03:15.360> saw<00:03:15.540> my

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
natural flavor if you guys saw my

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.240 
natural flavor if you guys saw my
previous<00:03:16.109> video<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.410> had<00:03:16.650> something<00:03:17.220> very

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
previous video I had something very

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.240 
previous video I had something very
similar<00:03:17.700> by<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.540> same<00:03:18.870> company<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:20.040> sort

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
similar by the same company and I sort

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.190 
similar by the same company and I sort
of<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:20.370> got<00:03:20.579> used<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.720> raw<00:03:21.900> natural

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
of just got used to the the raw natural

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170 
of just got used to the the raw natural
flavor<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.040> not<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.190> big<00:03:23.400> deal<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.880> me

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
flavor so it's not a big deal for me

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.630 
flavor so it's not a big deal for me
anymore<00:03:24.540> even<00:03:24.780> though<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.049> was<00:03:25.290> at<00:03:25.920> first<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
anymore even though it was at first so

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.940 
anymore even though it was at first so
that's<00:03:26.970> I'm<00:03:27.329> about<00:03:27.769> three-quarters<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
that's I'm about three-quarters of the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.830 
that's I'm about three-quarters of the
way<00:03:29.100> through<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:30.390> then<00:03:30.540> i'll<00:03:30.600> probably

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
way through this and then i'll probably

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.080 
way through this and then i'll probably
try<00:03:31.049> something<00:03:31.530> new<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.700> huge

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
try something new but this is huge

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.720 
try something new but this is huge
because<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.750> has<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.350> complete<00:03:35.010> amino<00:03:35.280> acid

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
because it has a complete amino acid

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.270 
because it has a complete amino acid
profile<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.780> forward<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.560> i'll<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:38.010> real

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
profile going forward and i'll be real
