in<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.280> following<00:00:02.429> tutorial<00:00:03.090> we're<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.270> to

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
in the following tutorial we're going to

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.999 
in the following tutorial we're going to
take<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.629> look<00:00:03.840> at<00:00:03.959> perspective<00:00:04.589> drawing<00:00:04.830> in

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
take a look at perspective drawing in

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.460 
take a look at perspective drawing in

introduction to motion graphics lecture
as<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> place<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.740> learn<00:00:11.130> where<00:00:11.460> some<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
as a place to learn where some of the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.600 
as a place to learn where some of the
stuff<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:13.009> perspective<00:00:14.009> drawing<00:00:14.250> is

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
stuff is but perspective drawing is

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.790 
stuff is but perspective drawing is
something<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.360> every<00:00:15.839> artist<00:00:16.230> has<00:00:16.350> always

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
something that every artist has always

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620 
something that every artist has always
studied<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.490> point<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.880> their<00:00:18.029> life<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
studied some point in their life and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.260 
studied some point in their life and
it's<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.740> drawing<00:00:19.980> technique<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.760> allows<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it's a drawing technique that allows you

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
it's a drawing technique that allows you
to<00:00:21.300> represent<00:00:21.920> three-dimensional<00:00:22.920> images

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
to represent three-dimensional images

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.179 
to represent three-dimensional images
with<00:00:23.670> two-dimensional<00:00:24.090> picture<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.980> it's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
with two-dimensional picture and so it's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.880 
with two-dimensional picture and so it's
been<00:00:26.250> used<00:00:26.580> by<00:00:26.789> architects<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:28.109> many<00:00:28.320> years

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
been used by architects for many years

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460 
been used by architects for many years
and<00:00:29.449> just<00:00:30.449> takes<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:30.990> bit<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> know-how

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and just takes a little bit of know-how

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.990 
and just takes a little bit of know-how
and<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.250> some<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.640> neat<00:00:32.969> things

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and you can do some really neat things

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.080 
and you can do some really neat things
with<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:34.050> drawing<00:00:34.770> technique<00:00:35.280> now<00:00:35.940> there

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
with this drawing technique now there

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
with this drawing technique now there
are<00:00:36.210> two<00:00:36.239> basic<00:00:36.719> types<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.440> elements<00:00:37.800> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
are two basic types of elements in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.250 
are two basic types of elements in
perspective<00:00:39.030> drawing<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:39.809> linear

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
perspective drawing there's linear

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
perspective drawing there's linear
perspective<00:00:40.610> which<00:00:41.610> deals<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
perspective which deals with the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
perspective which deals with the
organization<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> shapes<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.190> space<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
organization of the shapes in space and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
organization of the shapes in space and
how<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> lines<00:00:45.629> converge<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.950> there's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
how the lines converge and then there's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
how the lines converge and then there's
aerial<00:00:47.640> perspective<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.750> deals<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
aerial perspective which deals with the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
aerial perspective which deals with the
atmospheric<00:00:50.219> effects<00:00:50.670> such<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.300> tones

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
atmospheric effects such as the tones

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.229 
atmospheric effects such as the tones
and<00:00:51.809> colors<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.350> objects<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.610> closer<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and colors of objects that are closer to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.470 
and colors of objects that are closer to
the<00:00:55.199> person<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> viewer<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.760> here's<00:00:57.270> an

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the person the viewer so here's an

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
the person the viewer so here's an
example<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.890> nice

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
example of that this is a really nice

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.540 
example of that this is a really nice
example<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> 3d<00:01:00.780> rendering<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.859> shows<00:01:02.250> one

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
example of a 3d rendering that shows one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
example of a 3d rendering that shows one
point<00:01:02.879> perspective<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.110> all

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
point perspective so you can see all

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
point perspective so you can see all
these<00:01:04.589> lines<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.489> red<00:01:05.729> lines<00:01:05.909> are

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
these lines these red lines are

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.310 
these lines these red lines are
converging<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> center<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.170> see

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
converging to the center and you can see

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.760 
converging to the center and you can see
that<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> objects<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.790> objects<00:01:12.770> or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that all the objects of the objects or

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
that all the objects of the objects or
all<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> lines<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.729> those<00:01:14.909> objects<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.630> also

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
all the lines of those objects are also

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.270 
all the lines of those objects are also
converging<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.130> origin<00:01:17.850> point<00:01:18.150> anyway

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
converging at that origin point anyway

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
converging at that origin point anyway
this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.670> showing<00:01:21.000> us<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.750> course<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this is really showing us of course the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
this is really showing us of course the
linear<00:01:22.530> perspective<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
linear perspective to see the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
linear perspective to see the
atmospheric<00:01:24.509> perspective<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.530> roll<00:01:25.740> over

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
atmospheric perspective if I roll over

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
atmospheric perspective if I roll over
this<00:01:26.159> you'll<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> shows<00:01:27.630> me<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.200> 3d

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
this you'll see that it shows me a 3d

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.830 
this you'll see that it shows me a 3d
rendering<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.299> notice<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
rendering of it and you can notice that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
rendering of it and you can notice that
the<00:01:30.930> colors<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.650> back<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:32.159> much<00:01:32.460> less

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the colors in the back are much less

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
the colors in the back are much less
saturated<00:01:32.970> than<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> colors<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> front

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
saturated than the colors in the front

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
saturated than the colors in the front
and<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.579> good<00:01:35.759> indication<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and that's a really good indication of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.130 
and that's a really good indication of
how<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.979> atmospheric<00:01:38.729> perspective<00:01:39.210> changes

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
how that atmospheric perspective changes

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
how that atmospheric perspective changes
now<00:01:40.860> there<00:01:40.890> are<00:01:41.340> basically<00:01:41.790> three<00:01:41.939> different

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
now there are basically three different

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.020 
now there are basically three different
systems<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.590> perspective<00:01:44.159> drawings<00:01:44.549> there's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
systems for perspective drawings there's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.719 
systems for perspective drawings there's
the<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.450> point<00:01:45.780> perspective<00:01:46.250> which<00:01:47.250> allows

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the one point perspective which allows

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
the one point perspective which allows
us<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.420> vanishing<00:01:48.689> point<00:01:49.170> two

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
us to have one vanishing point two

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.670 
us to have one vanishing point two
vanishing<00:01:50.430> points<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.450> along<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
vanishing points which are along the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
vanishing points which are along the
horizon<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.299> third<00:01:54.750> perspective

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
horizon and then a third perspective

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.859 
horizon and then a third perspective
which<00:01:55.680> allows<00:01:56.159> us<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.939> nadir<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.659> well

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
which allows us to have a nadir as well

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.420 
which allows us to have a nadir as well
and<00:01:59.119> the<00:02:00.119> natter<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.780> nadir<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.250> really

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and the natter or nadir I'm not really

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.179 
and the natter or nadir I'm not really
sure<00:02:02.549> how<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.909> say<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.409> another

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
sure how they say it but it is another

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.889 
sure how they say it but it is another
point<00:02:05.579> which<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.820> either<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.810> down

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
point which is either up or down

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.919 
point which is either up or down
depending<00:02:07.259> upon<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.429> perspective<00:02:09.300> how

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
depending upon your perspective how

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.730 
depending upon your perspective how
you're<00:02:10.170> looking<00:02:10.530> at<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.770> object<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:13.050> had

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you're looking at this object if we had

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.850 
you're looking at this object if we had
object<00:02:14.220> above<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.910> horizon<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.410> nadir

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
object above the horizon then that nadir

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500 
object above the horizon then that nadir
would<00:02:17.040> actually<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.490> above<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> horizon<00:02:18.000> as

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
would actually be above the horizon as

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
would actually be above the horizon as
well<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.530> does<00:02:19.680> depend<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.220> how<00:02:20.550> you're

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
well so it does depend on how you're

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.610 
well so it does depend on how you're
looking<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.330> object<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.620> it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
looking at your object for that so it's

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.190 
looking at your object for that so it's
a<00:02:26.060> anyway<00:02:27.060> we're<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.840> dealing<00:02:27.990> with

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
a anyway we're going to be dealing with

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.800 
a anyway we're going to be dealing with
two<00:02:29.100> point<00:02:29.610> perspective<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.450> most<00:02:30.630> part

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
two point perspective for the most part

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.180 
two point perspective for the most part
because<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.740> little<00:02:31.860> bit<00:02:32.040> too

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
because this is a little bit too

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.650 
because this is a little bit too
complicated<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.880> most<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> drawings

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
complicated for most of the drawings

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.530 
complicated for most of the drawings
that<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.200> flash<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.880> two<00:02:36.240> point

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
that we do in flash so in two point

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.890 
that we do in flash so in two point
perspective<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.830> point<00:02:38.010> perspective

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
perspective and one point perspective

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200 
perspective and one point perspective
I've<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:40.110> some<00:02:40.320> examples<00:02:40.770> here<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:41.760> one

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
I've got some examples here for one

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.960 
I've got some examples here for one
point<00:02:42.480> perspective<00:02:42.690> definitely<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
point perspective definitely go to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.430 
point perspective definitely go to
google<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.090> check<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.780> some<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> images

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
google and check out some of the images

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.060 
google and check out some of the images
and<00:02:46.500> you'll<00:02:46.740> find<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.160> really<00:02:47.400> nice

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
and you'll find some really nice

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.740 
and you'll find some really nice
drawings<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.850> really<00:02:51.180> good<00:02:51.390> for

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
drawings here that are really good for

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.550 
drawings here that are really good for
animations<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.550> typical<00:02:53.910> perspective<00:02:54.840> that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
animations so a typical perspective that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.380 
animations so a typical perspective that
you<00:02:55.650> might<00:02:55.830> find<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.760> cityscape

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you might find is like this cityscape

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.810 
you might find is like this cityscape
and<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.440> great<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.710> animations<00:02:59.460> because

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
and this is great for animations because

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.610 
and this is great for animations because
it's<00:03:00.000> pretty<00:03:00.240> simple<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.960> realize<00:03:01.320> that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it's pretty simple to realize that

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.530 
it's pretty simple to realize that
everything<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.250> animating<00:03:02.880> from<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.270> one

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
everything is animating from that one

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.630 
everything is animating from that one
center<00:03:04.140> point<00:03:04.170> which<00:03:04.920> makes<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:05.340> drawings

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
center point which makes your drawings

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.730 
center point which makes your drawings
fairly<00:03:05.970> easy<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.330> do<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.410> also<00:03:07.590> use

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
fairly easy to do now you can also use

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.770 
fairly easy to do now you can also use
one<00:03:08.100> point<00:03:08.400> perspective<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:09.270> draw<00:03:09.450> really

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
one point perspective to draw really

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.710 
one point perspective to draw really
effective<00:03:10.610> drawings<00:03:11.610> for<00:03:11.880> animation<00:03:12.480> like

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
effective drawings for animation like

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.500 
effective drawings for animation like
this<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.140> background<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.710> an<00:03:13.980> animation

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
this is a background for an animation

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.210 
this is a background for an animation
possibly<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.860> one<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.040> nice<00:03:17.190> things

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
possibly and one of the nice things

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.270 
possibly and one of the nice things
about<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.390> has<00:03:18.600> an<00:03:19.350> arch<00:03:19.890> here

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
about this is that it has an arch here

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.010 
about this is that it has an arch here
where<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:20.700> could<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.120> character<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.750> enter

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
where they could the character can enter

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.770 
where they could the character can enter
in<00:03:22.200> which<00:03:22.710> means<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.580> masked<00:03:24.180> so

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
in which means that it can be masked so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.240 
in which means that it can be masked so
that<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.110> comes<00:03:25.410> into<00:03:25.740> that<00:03:26.190> area<00:03:28.070> which<00:03:29.070> is

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that it comes into that area which is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.980 
that it comes into that area which is
quite<00:03:29.430> nice<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.090> there's<00:03:30.510> also<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
quite nice and then there's also the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.160 
quite nice and then there's also the
depth<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.410> going<00:03:32.250> back<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.270> couch

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
depth of going back to the to the couch

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.800 
depth of going back to the to the couch
or<00:03:34.470> coming<00:03:35.100> up<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> front<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.360> mantle

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
or coming up to the front of this mantle

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.230 
or coming up to the front of this mantle
here<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.530> we<00:03:37.800> have<00:03:37.920> some<00:03:38.160> space<00:03:38.520> in<00:03:38.580> there<00:03:39.000> to

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
here so we have some space in there to

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.570 
here so we have some space in there to
allow<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.990> depth<00:03:40.320> change<00:03:40.830> which<00:03:41.310> could<00:03:41.340> be

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
allow a depth change which could be

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.540 
allow a depth change which could be
really<00:03:41.820> interesting<00:03:41.940> for<00:03:42.570> our<00:03:42.600> animation<00:03:43.550> if

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
really interesting for our animation if

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.040 
really interesting for our animation if
you<00:03:44.760> go<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.120> look<00:03:45.180> at<00:03:45.480> two<00:03:45.720> point<00:03:45.990> perspective

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
you go and look at two point perspective

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.560 
you go and look at two point perspective
you'll<00:03:46.770> find<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.160> lot<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.570> interesting

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
you'll find a lot of interesting

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.260 
you'll find a lot of interesting
examples<00:03:49.140> one<00:03:49.770> interesting<00:03:50.190> example<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:51.030> this

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
examples one interesting example is this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.770 
examples one interesting example is this
which<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.720> kind<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.910> kind<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.360> feels<00:03:54.570> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
which is kind of a it kind of feels a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.840 
which is kind of a it kind of feels a
little<00:03:54.960> awkward<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.920> looking<00:03:56.310> at<00:03:56.460> it<00:03:56.610> with

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
little awkward to be looking at it with

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.800 
little awkward to be looking at it with
this<00:03:57.090> perspective<00:03:57.740> but<00:03:58.970> I'm<00:03:59.970> sure<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.660> this

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
this perspective but I'm sure that this

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.030 
this perspective but I'm sure that this
is<00:04:01.020> something<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.470> you've<00:04:01.650> seen<00:04:01.890> before

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
is something that you've seen before

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
is something that you've seen before
this<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> little<00:04:03.510> bit<00:04:03.630> more<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.200> our

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
this is a little bit more of our

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.580 
this is a little bit more of our
standard<00:04:05.010> style<00:04:05.760> here<00:04:06.180> where<00:04:06.390> we<00:04:07.230> see<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
standard style here where we see the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.080 
standard style here where we see the
lens<00:04:07.800> kind<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.130> converge<00:04:08.520> here<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.940> bottom

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
lens kind of converge here in the bottom

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.330 
lens kind of converge here in the bottom
whereas<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.470> lines<00:04:10.740> are<00:04:10.980> kind<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.190> going

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
whereas this the lines are kind of going

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.180 
whereas this the lines are kind of going
off<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.940> edge<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.570> it<00:04:12.600> kind<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.560> gives<00:04:13.740> us<00:04:14.010> a

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
off the edge so it kind of gives us a

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640 
off the edge so it kind of gives us a
strange<00:04:14.850> feeling<00:04:15.360> here<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.320> can<00:04:16.470> see

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
strange feeling here but you can see

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.860 
strange feeling here but you can see
that<00:04:16.680> these<00:04:17.040> lines<00:04:17.370> converge<00:04:17.940> on<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.239> point<00:04:18.690> up

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
that these lines converge on a point up

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.370 
that these lines converge on a point up
here<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.650> then<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.640> one<00:04:21.169> vanishes<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.350> a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
here and then this one vanishes to a

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.680 
here and then this one vanishes to a
point<00:04:22.710> that's<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.070> outside<00:04:23.130> so<00:04:24.090> typically

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
point that's on the outside so typically

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.260 
point that's on the outside so typically
when<00:04:24.960> we<00:04:25.020> do<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.830> our<00:04:25.979> perspective<00:04:26.669> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
when we do the our perspective the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.580 
when we do the our perspective the
usually<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.599> points<00:04:27.930> are<00:04:28.020> somewhere<00:04:28.349> on<00:04:28.470> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
usually the points are somewhere on the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.920 
usually the points are somewhere on the
outside<00:04:29.039> rather<00:04:29.729> than<00:04:30.000> kind<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.449> being<00:04:30.690> in<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
outside rather than kind of being in the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.869 
outside rather than kind of being in the
middle<00:04:31.289> of<00:04:31.379> our<00:04:31.500> drawing<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:32.280> this<00:04:32.490> one<00:04:32.729> is

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
middle of our drawing like this one is

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.820 
middle of our drawing like this one is
and<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.720> point<00:04:34.020> would<00:04:34.139> be<00:04:34.169> somewhere

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
and that that point would be somewhere

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.540 
and that that point would be somewhere
up<00:04:34.979> there<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.900> just<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.259> aware<00:04:37.289> of<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.979> as

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
up there so just be aware of that as

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.860 
up there so just be aware of that as
you're<00:04:38.789> working<00:04:38.909> your<00:04:39.210> drawings<00:04:39.539> in<00:04:39.659> flash

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
you're working your drawings in flash

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.320 
you're working your drawings in flash
now<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.680> lash<00:04:41.009> what<00:04:41.550> we're<00:04:41.699> going<00:04:41.849> to<00:04:42.000> do<00:04:42.150> is

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
now a lash what we're going to do is

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.839 
now a lash what we're going to do is
open<00:04:42.900> up<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.289> two-point<00:04:43.800> perspective<00:04:44.039> start

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
open up the two-point perspective start

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.469 
open up the two-point perspective start

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
get started with this drawing project

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.070 
get started with this drawing project
you'll<00:04:50.669> notice<00:04:50.909> that<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.389> has<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.629> horizon

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
you'll notice that it has a horizon

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.730 
you'll notice that it has a horizon

point a guides layer and a box the box

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.129 
point a guides layer and a box the box
is<00:04:56.009> going<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.340> be<00:04:56.430> one<00:04:56.759> of<00:04:56.909> the<00:04:57.030> animated<00:04:57.569> boxes

is going to be one of the animated boxes
that<00:04:58.379> we<00:04:58.620> draw<00:04:58.889> let's<00:04:59.669> go<00:04:59.849> ahead<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.479> open<00:05:00.690> up

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
that we draw let's go ahead and open up

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.629 
that we draw let's go ahead and open up
that<00:05:01.080> file<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:01.680> then<00:05:01.830> go<00:05:02.039> on<00:05:02.069> to<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.430> next
