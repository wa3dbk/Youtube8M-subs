00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.060 
are foods that you can eat anyhow so and
as<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.430> say<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.300> skin<00:03:32.540> exactly<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.800> I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
as you say it for the skin exactly and I

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.800 
as you say it for the skin exactly and I
think<00:03:34.130> people<00:03:34.670> are<00:03:34.820> beginning<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.209> understand

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
think people are beginning to understand

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.229 
think people are beginning to understand
that<00:03:35.930> toxins<00:03:36.920> get<00:03:37.130> absorbed<00:03:37.459> into<00:03:37.820> their<00:03:38.030> skin

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
that toxins get absorbed into their skin

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.570 
that toxins get absorbed into their skin
and<00:03:38.300> they<00:03:38.480> want<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.080> avoid<00:03:39.530> synthetic<00:03:40.160> and

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
and they want to avoid synthetic and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.729 
and they want to avoid synthetic and
natural<00:03:40.880> products<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:41.750> people<00:03:42.019> don't<00:03:42.620> always

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
natural products but people don't always

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.920 
natural products but people don't always
make<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.010> connection<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.540> good<00:03:44.690> stuff

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
make the connection that the good stuff

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.190 
make the connection that the good stuff
can<00:03:45.260> get<00:03:45.440> absorbed<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.730> great<00:03:47.330> point<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
can get absorbed to a great point the

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.140 
can get absorbed to a great point the
enzymes<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.830> honey

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
enzymes in the honey

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.509 
enzymes in the honey
in<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.510> papaya<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.590> everything<00:03:51.370> that
