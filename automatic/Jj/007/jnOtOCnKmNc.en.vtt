00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.210
 assignment 2 some paintball in the sides 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.750
 corner let's go see how 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.850
 you have beards and that sounds 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.030
 the city and that meant it 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.520
 10 of 10 cm barries and 10 are on the way 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.850
 satÃ© all three teenagers in one side 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.680
 with three pawns on their aunt and you 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.990
 you must be shot off and whole 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.100
 applicable to the background it 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.309
 number 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.929
 paint it black from the rolling stones 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.899
 Whom that health should be a genius 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:43.420
 and there will be the first one here 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.420
 quarter rinses a lot 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.609
 shot with the paintball it is 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.649
 of course difficult because we are a beauty 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.309
 focus on governance and the other 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.530
 does it have to 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.469
 one will operate a weapon and there one goes 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.240
 half pawn from December 10 is just none 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:03.610
 panic because if should that count 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.610
 whole purpose of being closed 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.570
 have also suffered a lot of wages and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.670
 10ct very enthusiastic from the window that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 knows the saying for all behind 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.220
 The wheel 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 the paint on the wall and this case there 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.170
 becomes less balcony foxes city shots 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.450
 and going to deposit first that accident 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.370
 10 cm has come off but give you someone 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.370
 we have two more chances 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.460
 sometimes a little help is given 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.340
 the loading of these games though 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.030
 not always successful and high it happens 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.040
 over there 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.390
 team supports an int and hay building 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.950
 are they hungry or something 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.170
 I do n't know either, but she is in it 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 anyway to fix 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.250
 they ca n't put a can on it and make it there 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.800
 other teams naturally use 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.880
 by turning it around here 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:03.550
 even ten cents Barry that next will 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.690
 stops there one by one all that 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.690
 dogs off 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.340
 and there goes the last one and that means 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.420
 that team they no longer participate in it 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.340
 game 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.810
 they have lost anyway it goes now 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.090
 on 110 of and teams and babies 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.970
 now a bit behind it 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.450
 are turning and yes there you are 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.450
 completely stuck 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.170
 a song on the abyss so down 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.170
 changed 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.890
 and there they are just passing by that shed 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.890
 that just goes well 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.220
 for those who shot loose and stand there 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.530
 she then finally silent 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 side by side and teams make it one 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.400
 natural use of because it stops 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.980
 out to the field 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.330
 the other pawn to shoot her and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.190
 he doesn't want to succeed and hope so 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.629
 happens there on 2 wheels repetition 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.970
 please that goes just fine there 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.040
 almost layer them on their side a 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.299
 what good jokes me again and again 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.299
 a collision ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.450
 and from here the last two 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.750
 pawns of 10 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.319
 shot them there and that means that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.319
 there is a winner
