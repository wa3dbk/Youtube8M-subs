00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.350
 growth that stand before motorists in 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.620
 preparation time for your trip 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.370
 this food with this over grow no 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.150
 problems no cafes are found everywhere 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:26.240
 all the way for every taste and color 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.350
 as for the choice of location there is 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.000
 standard answer 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.860
 stay where the cars are 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.090
 truckers with your permission i 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.120
 I will answer a little differently 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.780
 stay at those places that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.179
 have a foundation that is it is not 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.879
 container trays tents a building 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.489
 who stand on the ground have a sign you 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.999
 feel free to stop without much 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.620
 and fears to eat why is that so 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.690
 that the cafe on the highway is basically 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.149
 exists at the expense of regular clientele 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.370
 As a rule, it is a truck driver 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.559
 who often move along this 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.550
 track and already made your choice in 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.750
 favor of this or that institution in case 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.060
 if one day 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.030
 kp provides such a client 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.680
 low-quality service truckers 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.869
 very quickly it is between themselves 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.899
 spread on the radio there during 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.909
 this gas stations and so on and cafes 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.469
 is starting to lose its customers what 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.590
 happens by institution when he loses 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.869
 its customers, it closes therefore 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.380
 all establishments on the track value their 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.369
 reputation and be sure that you have 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.369
 definitely not poisoned 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.240
 1:30 Potter you to drive us 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.200
 Lipetsk region 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.420
 all the same comfortable 4 lanes 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 dividing line on this plot to us 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.240
 I met one valid paid 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.720
 stretch of road and one being on 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.720
 construction phase 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.660
 features of the route m-4 for such here 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.150
 garbage containers that periodically 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.400
 can be found near the road I'm home with 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.040
 such an inscription and you know it 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.770
 running does not arise desire 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.920
 throwing trash just stupid out into the street 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.920
 window 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.720
 unfortunately fortunately we didn't hit on 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.590
 Voronezh bypass it passed this 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.310
 part of the way through the city but i'm ready 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.300
 tell what you heard from 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.050
 truckers as of 1400 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.480
 side of Rostov 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.750
 difficulty about three and a half 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.370
 kilometers of difficulty this is due to 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.990
 what is going active building interchanges 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.000
 Voronezh bypass this is closer 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.400
 on the side of Rostov there is very terrible 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.910
 organized movement is very difficult 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.770
 the intersection is very narrow 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.980
 so in case 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.850
 bypass in the season still will not finish 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:09.160
 I 'm afraid that travelers will wait 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.160
 there is a big hot fucking 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.479
 here 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.960
 radio station on the highway m4 was 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.970
 practically useless stuff despite 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.639
 the fact that the track is really big 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.669
 the number of machines would seem to be aired 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.759
 keep busy talking but 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.160
 the radio station is silent for hours 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:33.190
 get information about the situation on the road 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.190
 ahead of us is unrealistic even on request
