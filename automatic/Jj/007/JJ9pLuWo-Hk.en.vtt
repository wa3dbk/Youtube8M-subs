00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
today or next tues so that's kind of my

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.240 
today or next tues so that's kind of my
reasons<00:02:12.390> behind<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:12.900> today

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
reasons behind that now today

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
reasons behind that now today
we're<00:02:13.340> only<00:02:13.490> going<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:13.820> talking<00:02:14.030> about

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
we're only going to be talking about

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.030 
we're only going to be talking about
these<00:02:14.540> zombies<00:02:14.960> map<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.380> my<00:02:15.500> two<00:02:15.560> theories

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
these zombies map and my two theories

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.590 
these zombies map and my two theories
that<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:16.520> come<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.850> with<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.210> this<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
that I have come up with for this and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720 
that I have come up with for this and
the<00:02:17.660> map<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.990> called<00:02:18.200> buried<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:18.860> if<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.580> take

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the map is called buried so if you take

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.820 
the map is called buried so if you take
a<00:02:19.790> look<00:02:19.970> at<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.420> does<00:02:20.660> look<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:21.140> or<00:02:21.620> if<00:02:21.770> you

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
a look at it it does look like or if you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.990 
a look at it it does look like or if you
look<00:02:21.980> at<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.130> zombie<00:02:22.490> he's<00:02:22.610> wearing<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.850> cowboy

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
look at the zombie he's wearing a cowboy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.820 
look at the zombie he's wearing a cowboy
hat<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.720> looks<00:02:23.870> like<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.110> old<00:02:24.230> settler<00:02:24.650> from

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
hat so it looks like an old settler from

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.080 
hat so it looks like an old settler from
the<00:02:24.920> eighteen<00:02:25.220> hundreds<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.640> something<00:02:25.940> like

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the eighteen hundreds of something like

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.210 
the eighteen hundreds of something like
that<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:27.110> got<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.410> blue<00:02:27.590> eyes<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.100> I'm

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that and it's got the blue eyes so I'm

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.410 
that and it's got the blue eyes so I'm
guessing<00:02:28.430> we're<00:02:28.670> going<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.940> back<00:02:29.150> with<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
guessing we're going to be back with the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.810 
guessing we're going to be back with the
the<00:02:30.110> new<00:02:30.230> characters<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.890> stuff<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.670> want

the new characters and stuff and I want

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.430

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
to say that in the fourth DLC that's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.510 
to say that in the fourth DLC that's
when<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.709> old<00:02:33.830> characters<00:02:34.220> are<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.459> to

it's<00:02:38.000> wearing<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.240> cowboy<00:02:38.360> hat<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:38.840> take<00:02:39.080> a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
it's wearing the cowboy hat and take a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.810 
it's wearing the cowboy hat and take a
look<00:02:39.320> at<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.560> walls<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.070> know<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.370> got<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
look at the walls you know it's got the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.310 
look at the walls you know it's got the
it<00:02:41.180> looks<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.450> you're<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.750> mine<00:02:41.990> pretty

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
it looks like you're in a mine pretty

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.020 
it looks like you're in a mine pretty
much<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.740> map<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.040> called<00:02:43.280> buried<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
much and the map is called buried and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.729 
much and the map is called buried and
generally<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.110> hear<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.350> word<00:02:45.500> Barry

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
generally when you hear the word Barry

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:46.930 
generally when you hear the word Barry
do<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.010> think<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.310> something<00:02:46.640> buried

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
do you think of something buried

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.699 
do you think of something buried
underground<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.720> underground<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.560> key

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
underground so underground is the key

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.380 
underground so underground is the key
word<00:02:48.739> there<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.550> look<00:02:49.910> at<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.360> looks

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
word there and look at this it looks

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.970 
word there and look at this it looks
like<00:02:50.690> you're<00:02:50.810> underground<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.440> some<00:02:51.650> sort<00:02:51.860> of

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
like you're underground and some sort of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.090 
like you're underground and some sort of
tunnel<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.520> if<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.270> settlers<00:02:53.780> my<00:02:54.440> theory<00:02:54.860> my

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
tunnel and if it's settlers my theory my

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.890 
tunnel and if it's settlers my theory my
first<00:02:55.340> theory<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.600> going<00:02:56.840> to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
first theory is that this is going to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.680 
first theory is that this is going to
take<00:02:57.080> place<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.860> Old<00:02:58.130> West<00:02:58.250> area<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.180> the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
take place in the Old West area and the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.780 
take place in the Old West area and the
California<00:03:00.050> Gold<00:03:00.350> Rush<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:01.160> know<00:03:01.280> time<00:03:01.550> frame

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
California Gold Rush you know time frame

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.310 
California Gold Rush you know time frame
that's<00:03:01.940> what<00:03:02.120> i'm<00:03:02.239> thinking<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.840> gold<00:03:03.110> rush

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
that's what i'm thinking the gold rush

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.080 
that's what i'm thinking the gold rush
time<00:03:03.620> frame<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.070> you're<00:03:04.250> you're<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
time frame and you're you're in a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.120 
time frame and you're you're in a
mineshaft<00:03:05.390> pretty<00:03:06.080> much<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.650> i<00:03:06.860> think<00:03:07.040> it'd

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
mineshaft pretty much and i think it'd

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.280 
mineshaft pretty much and i think it'd
be<00:03:07.220> pretty<00:03:07.370> cool<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.870> could<00:03:08.959> hop<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.260> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
be pretty cool if you could hop on a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.290 
be pretty cool if you could hop on a
little<00:03:09.500> mine<00:03:09.709> cart<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:11.000> know<00:03:11.120> right

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
little mine cart and you know right

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.000 
little mine cart and you know right
railroad<00:03:11.720> tracks<00:03:12.050> or<00:03:12.470> ride<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.830> railroad

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
railroad tracks or ride the railroad

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.350 
railroad tracks or ride the railroad
tracks<00:03:13.400> all<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.580> way<00:03:13.670> down<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.030> mind<00:03:14.239> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
tracks all the way down the mind and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.610 
tracks all the way down the mind and
stuff<00:03:14.570> think<00:03:14.780> about<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.170> how<00:03:15.290> cool<00:03:15.500> would

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
stuff think about that how cool would

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280 
stuff think about that how cool would
that<00:03:15.680> be<00:03:15.830> another<00:03:16.820> theory<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:18.049> takes

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
that be another theory is that it takes

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.050 
that be another theory is that it takes
place<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.830> paris<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.549> reason<00:03:19.820> for<00:03:19.970> this

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
place in paris and the reason for this

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.520 
place in paris and the reason for this
is<00:03:20.120> i<00:03:20.510> don't<00:03:20.570> buy<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.350> much

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
is i don't buy this one that much

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.039 
is i don't buy this one that much
because<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.940> know<00:03:23.060> Paris<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.630> don't<00:03:23.780> think<00:03:23.959> it

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
because you know Paris I don't think it

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.509 
because you know Paris I don't think it
would<00:03:24.170> take<00:03:24.200> place<00:03:24.470> underground<00:03:24.950> with<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
would take place underground with a

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.370 
would take place underground with a
bunch<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.880> settler<00:03:26.299> cowboy<00:03:26.690> looking<00:03:27.019> zombies

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
bunch of settler cowboy looking zombies

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.530 
bunch of settler cowboy looking zombies
so<00:03:27.950> i'm<00:03:28.010> gonna<00:03:28.130> guess<00:03:28.370> it's<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
so i'm gonna guess it's in the the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.180 
so i'm gonna guess it's in the the
California<00:03:30.110> Gold<00:03:30.140> Rush<00:03:30.350> timeframe<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.100> i

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
California Gold Rush timeframe like i

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.160 
California Gold Rush timeframe like i
said<00:03:31.459> but<00:03:31.670> however<00:03:32.120> if<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.660> does<00:03:32.840> take<00:03:33.049> place

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
said but however if it does take place

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.810 
said but however if it does take place
in<00:03:33.380> paris<00:03:33.739> i<00:03:33.830> heard<00:03:33.980> some<00:03:34.160> people<00:03:34.430> say<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.760> in

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
in paris i heard some people say that in

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.949 
in paris i heard some people say that in
the<00:03:34.910> background<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:35.330> can<00:03:35.450> see<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.660> Eiffel

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
the background you can see the Eiffel

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.170 
the background you can see the Eiffel
Tower<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.500> looked<00:03:37.040> at<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.310> image<00:03:37.670> for<00:03:37.880> like<00:03:38.030> a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
Tower I looked at the image for like a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.460 
Tower I looked at the image for like a
good<00:03:38.299> five<00:03:38.540> minutes<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:39.049> didn't<00:03:39.290> see<00:03:39.440> that

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
good five minutes and I didn't see that

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.890 
good five minutes and I didn't see that
but<00:03:39.920> if<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.670> does<00:03:40.820> take<00:03:41.000> place<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.330> Paris<00:03:41.630> my

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
but if it does take place in Paris my

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.479 
but if it does take place in Paris my
only<00:03:42.049> really<00:03:42.380> theory<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.250> for<00:03:43.370> that

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
only really theory that I have for that

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.370 
only really theory that I have for that
is<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.880> takes<00:03:44.060> place<00:03:44.329> in<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.570> catacombs<00:03:45.110> of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
is it takes place in the catacombs of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.530 
is it takes place in the catacombs of
Paris<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.340> tunnels<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:47.480> run

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
Paris and that is the tunnels that run

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.970 
Paris and that is the tunnels that run
under<00:03:47.870> Paris<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.320> know<00:03:48.410> just<00:03:48.620> pretty<00:03:48.799> much

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
under Paris you know just pretty much

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.340 
under Paris you know just pretty much
mass<00:03:49.310> tombs<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.000> stuff<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:51.019> really<00:03:51.230> don't

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
mass tombs and stuff and I really don't

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.350 
mass tombs and stuff and I really don't
think<00:03:51.470> it'd<00:03:51.739> be<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.489> that's<00:03:53.000> pretty<00:03:53.269> much

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
think it'd be that so that's pretty much

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.670 
think it'd be that so that's pretty much
my<00:03:53.630> two<00:03:53.690> theories<00:03:54.140> let<00:03:54.350> me<00:03:54.410> know<00:03:54.500> what<00:03:54.620> you

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
my two theories let me know what you

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.560 
my two theories let me know what you
think<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.920> this<00:03:55.040> down<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.640> comments<00:03:56.150> and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
think of this down in the comments and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.330 
think of this down in the comments and
if<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.140> guys<00:03:57.260> want<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.739> leave<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.100> like<00:03:58.280> and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
if you guys want to leave a like and
