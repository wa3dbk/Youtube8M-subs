whatever you want to play it so when you

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.870 
whatever you want to play it so when you
see<00:01:41.720> me<00:01:41.840> playing<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.259> minor<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:43.220> not<00:01:43.460> exactly

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
see me playing a minor it's not exactly

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.609 
see me playing a minor it's not exactly
an<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.119> minor<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:45.380> would<00:01:45.530> be<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:47.080> whole<00:01:48.080> step<00:01:48.350> down

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
an a minor it would be a whole step down

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.120 
an a minor it would be a whole step down
from<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.100> which<00:01:49.280> would<00:01:49.460> be<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.580> G<00:01:49.880> minor

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
from that which would be a G minor

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.690 
from that which would be a G minor
standard

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
standard

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
standard
is<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:55.850> yeah<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.150> think<00:01:57.900> that's<00:01:58.110> right

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
is that right yeah I think that's right

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.399 
is that right yeah I think that's right
so<00:02:00.720> it's<00:02:00.930> basically<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> minor<00:02:02.100> shape<00:02:03.409> here

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so it's basically the a minor shape here

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.280 
so it's basically the a minor shape here
at<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> minor<00:02:05.280> stage<00:02:05.580> up<00:02:06.330> one<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.050> still

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
at the a minor stage up one you still

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
at the a minor stage up one you still

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.350 
and then you slide up two frets and go
to<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.170> nice<00:02:46.440> Evan<00:02:46.830> which<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.640> play<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.120> bass

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
to a nice Evan which I play the bass

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.210 
to a nice Evan which I play the bass
note<00:02:48.659> here<00:02:49.409> so<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> lot<00:02:50.159> deeper

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.010 

and<00:02:54.670> that's<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.970> lead-up<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.510> cordis<00:02:55.840> and

and that's the lead-up to the cordis and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.770 
and that's the lead-up to the cordis and
then<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.200> goes<00:02:56.320> into<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> minor

see<00:03:00.860> five<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.459> what<00:03:02.610> is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.800 

hopefully<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.830> some<00:03:32.070> insight<00:03:32.520> on<00:03:32.810> how

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
