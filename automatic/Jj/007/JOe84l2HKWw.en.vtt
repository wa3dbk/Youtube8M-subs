00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.289
 Hi here in from and today I 'm going to teach how 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.630
 is that son of the hairstyle here I am 

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:12.110
 using it now is very easy, you go 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.290
 need only two elastics and 2 or 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.119
 4 hair clips completed in several 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.189
 Flemish we do not have a doctor had 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.630
 the smaller ones and this will require a 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.039
 Cupid 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.039
 or several middles 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.609
 so come on first I shared my 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.960
 cool hair in the middle you have several 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.720
 to layer your hair for example 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.480
 he is of this size to everyone who believes 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.910
 tactic than if it were only the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.140
 my hair is not just my opinion no 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.140
 it's just a tip get out then split in the middle 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.440
 even a little behind the ear not in the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.910
 height of the ears of a little 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.910
 Really, you have a bump. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.850
 so and now with clamp 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.800
 You will put it from the bottom up. 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.440
 Like that, because then, it's better that I 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.820
 I think it was the turn of the time. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.650
 then there is only one thing and ignore this 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 part of hair and if it is going to be 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.010
 too thick or too cool 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.910
 Then I left the chosen one but at last it goes to 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.480
 king party 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.240
 I think it 's just that you made it forward. 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.980
 that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:50.150
 I just gave it easy, right? 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.150
 and then the clamp puts to go to a single head 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.140
 to glaze 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.590
 Ready, this is all very easy and please. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.850
 ignores that the acid is black with it either 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:26.830
 show how it is 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:28.600
 in other years then is hope 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.070
 everybody can do 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.640
 he is one more hairstyle that had the photo 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.030
 because obviously you have an applique 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.340
 spoiled wrong as mine so he is 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.360
 male take photo, because they do not 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.520
 is really cool because the app 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.990
 but you have long hair will not have 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.190
 this kind of problem 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.190
 and this is it
