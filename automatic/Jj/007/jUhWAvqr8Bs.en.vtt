big<00:00:06.150> day<00:00:07.429> the<00:00:08.429> whole<00:00:08.610> liner<00:00:08.790> material<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.510> think

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
big day the whole liner material I think

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.419 
big day the whole liner material I think
looks<00:00:10.800> great<00:00:11.150> it<00:00:12.150> took<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.950> little<00:00:13.950> bit<00:00:14.099> more<00:00:14.340> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
looks great it took a little bit more of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
looks great it took a little bit more of
the<00:00:14.490> glue<00:00:14.700> than<00:00:14.880> his<00:00:15.420> sickle<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> do

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the glue than his sickle is going to do

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.019 
the glue than his sickle is going to do
but<00:00:16.500> beyond<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.550> worked<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:17.850> pretty

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
but beyond that it worked out pretty

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.109 
but beyond that it worked out pretty
well<00:00:18.980> you<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.189> go<00:00:20.340> through<00:00:20.520> about<00:00:20.699> twice<00:00:20.939> as

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
well you do go through about twice as

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.580 
well you do go through about twice as
much<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.630> say<00:00:21.810> you're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
much as they say you're going to and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920 
much as they say you're going to and
maybe<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:22.980> went<00:00:23.570> aggressive<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.779> much

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
maybe I just went aggressive on how much

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.490 
maybe I just went aggressive on how much
I<00:00:25.019> put<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> looks<00:00:27.630> fine<00:00:27.869> there

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I put on but I think it looks fine there

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.439 
I put on but I think it looks fine there
you<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> dimples<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you can see some of the dimples from the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.600 
you can see some of the dimples from the
screws<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.399> compared<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> what

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
screws and the like but compared to what

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.130 
screws and the like but compared to what
it<00:00:32.700> used<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.969> look<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.570> think<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.960> great

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it used to look like I think it's great

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
it used to look like I think it's great
now<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.370> thing<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.640> am<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.120> mentioned

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
now the one thing I am doing I mentioned

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
now the one thing I am doing I mentioned
this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.140> painting<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.770> area

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this is that I'm painting the area

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.389 
this is that I'm painting the area
behind<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.480> galley<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.040> because

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
behind the the galley and so because

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.160 
behind the the galley and so because
that<00:00:41.550> paint<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.910> still<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.390> need<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> put<00:00:42.960> about

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
notice I did is I put some foam some

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.470 
notice I did is I put some foam some
closed-cell<00:00:49.410> foam<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> help<00:00:50.760> close

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
closed-cell foam up here to help close

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
closed-cell foam up here to help close
to<00:00:51.800> eliminate<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> dimple<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.309> X<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> see

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to eliminate the dimple of X you can see

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.400 
to eliminate the dimple of X you can see
right<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.050> done<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> much

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
right here it's actually done a much

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
right here it's actually done a much
better<00:00:55.440> job<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:56.789> happy<00:00:57.120> about

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
better job so I was pretty happy about

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
better job so I was pretty happy about
how<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.719> that's<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> turn<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.460> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
how I think that's going to turn out I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
how I think that's going to turn out I
haven't<00:01:00.300> quite<00:01:00.600> sussed<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.230> going

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
haven't quite sussed out what I'm going

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
is and that went on with some 3m rubber

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.810 
is and that went on with some 3m rubber
headliner<00:01:24.960> adhesive<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.250> stuff<00:01:26.520> stinks

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
headliner adhesive and that stuff stinks

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.090 
headliner adhesive and that stuff stinks
like<00:01:27.030> sticks<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.140> stink<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:28.979> uh

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I'd already started on my second beer

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.030 
I'd already started on my second beer
and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> figured<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.740> something

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and I figured you know that's something

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
and I figured you know that's something
to<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.490> clear<00:01:53.759> head<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.149> possible

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
to do with this clear head as possible

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
to do with this clear head as possible
so<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.439> gonna<00:01:55.530> tackle<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.040> port's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so we're gonna tackle the port's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.330 
so we're gonna tackle the port's
tomorrow<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.530> get<00:01:58.530> most<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.070> stuff

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
tomorrow and get most of this stuff

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
tomorrow and get most of this stuff
wrapped<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.060> other<00:02:00.210> than<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.390> I'd<00:02:00.780> say

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
wrapped up but other than that I'd say

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.310 
wrapped up but other than that I'd say
