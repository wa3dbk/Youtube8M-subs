 there is no French language so 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.380
 you put in English tension the game is going 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.770

 install the multi you do and alas 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.960
 if you do not have to do anything else 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.490
 it will not work 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.670
 you go in your folder you go 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.510
 install or you have install steam 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.310
 so that's you who see me I 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 the installed in world to your voice china 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.340
 So here it is you who see 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.290
 so from the hall to 7 at home I 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.180
 so you go where you have it where you 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.070
 have a dirty estimate so it's steam 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.610
 then you have to have exactly the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.010
 same thing as me you go in steam 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.960
 slim ap common euro transmitter 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.090
 did that want to know everything it's done next 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.410
 great neck this fact nex is made 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.470
 installs I do not want to do it he's 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.100
 already there then you will have the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.000
 multiplayer you can start it 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.960
 but but but but but you can not 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.490
 not to return because it is necessary 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.450
 connect with ThiÃ¨s IDs 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.500
 from mv.com to connect to the game but 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.060
 you can not login because 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.650
 that I do not know why but you can 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.260
 not to make a robin on the site mam 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.590
 so what you have to do is create a 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.000
 text document up then also for those 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.980
 who say they do not know it takes 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.240
 download the latest version on sim 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.220
 if it still sends you a message 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.230
 error that you have installed 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.970
 the thing as I wanted to say that it does not 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.400
 not work you're going all 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.680
 just what you did not put in 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.360
 day your game on steam so also by 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.730
 precision I say it anyway 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.620
 the game on steam to have the multi it 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.360
 it's something that seems obvious to me but 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.310
 I read you then commits once 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.370
 you have the game on steam are which 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.510
 the multi does not work as I say 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.890
 you go on the game they have to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.200
 are in last version for that you 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 right click on the property game 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.560
 beta is there he has to be in the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.359
 last version bella here is the 1.3 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.000
 so that's not it's a point 19.1 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.010
 yeah that's it and there it is in the last 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.270
 version is so there will be no 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.340
 problem like it would not work 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.580
 then done that you can not do 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.100

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.970
 do up do it paste here it's organized 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.280
 it makes you choose your 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.160
 server so you go hop to europe from 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.880

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.930
 what happens is that 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:52.920
 how do you explain that the 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.240

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.470
 full all that you are connected with 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.280

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.930
 class to connect 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.110
 I have the place so it will connect 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.580
