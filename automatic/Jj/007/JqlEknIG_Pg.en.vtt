00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 today dressed like this in its inclusion 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.750
 I bring you achieve more in minecraft 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.960
 totally without many but before 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.360
 start I want to show you this so that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.009
 go to see the video the punch as 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.400
 can see here we have where the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.520
 drilling here was sweeping with all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 the trees and over there to the bottom 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.490
 see how it begins to destroy completely 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.189
 the mountain that is over there as they can 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 see now the drilling machine starts 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.489
 this I tell you this is very epic les 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.260
 I highly recommend that you go see 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.460
 video the September drill how it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.530
 does all this and the truth is that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.079
 only two commands are needed 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.969
 to do all this I recommend it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.670
 rather than winning that video but good 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.890
 let's continue with the video of the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.809
 holograms so to speak the screens and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.610
 how to call them I think it achieves more is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.240
 Well, now I'm going to show you 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.790
 has left in the last update 14 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.700
 w21 see that these names are very 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.740
 difficult one you name me I learn this has 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.650
 come out that you can now name 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.840
 above those of the iters or for example 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.640
 here he invoked an item and as you can see 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.750
 I can name it up something that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.060
 Well, it's like that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.440
 there we have the name we can change 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.270
 Well, the name obviously we can 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.280
 put me I know the apple the apple 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.740
 apple of truth because like that but 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.440
 good berga put long 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.810
 unconsciously now we were have 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.060
 the apple of truth there we have it 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.900
 this we can do with swords with 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 practically any this one 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.500
 any object only what 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.740
 we have to do is change the name 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.710
 here for example to put him 154 thing that does not 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.470
 I know neither what is the 154 we are to see and you 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.360
 we give for example and we have a hopper or 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.010
 for example we can change it to this 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.930
 let's see if we get something right 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.200
 I love you months the Nazis believe that the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.450
 idea of ​​diamonds 264 if I'm not wrong 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.160
 there we are a diamond with the name 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.140
 of the apple tree of truth I tell you no 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.760
 has great great mystery is quite 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.040
 simple alike if they want to do this they 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.959
 I will put it in the description that 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.000
 only here because they change the air if 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.610
 they want another object and if they want to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 example to change the name for him here 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.150
 where I did custom line they change the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.490
 name and ready is all they have to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.990
 do let's try one more time as not 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.330
 is we have a diamond helmet that 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.620
 call apple of truth the only bad thing 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.830
 is that as you can see here they are called 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.230
 apple the truth and if I take it and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.610
 here already changes the name to the original no 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.020
 which I would like for example if 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.600
 you put the name on it when 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.150
 pick up then call as you like 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.820
 called at the beginning no, but well, that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.020
 this is only for them to understand 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.810
 how this works 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.330
 well now with this thanks to this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.840
 new this new command that can be 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.450
 do with items we can invoke an item 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.050
 that is invisible in this case is a 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.650
 woman school or these heads of the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.720
 widgets 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.939
 we make it invisible and now yes 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.010
 we put the name on top then it goes to 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.569
 appear to be purely pure 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.970
 name as you can see here we have the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.530
 name obviously here also 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.870
 we can change the name with this what 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.280
 we delete as you can see we can change 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.790
 the name for example put something that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.990
 we are and if we put this there is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.210
 my own 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.600
 we are well here we have a penis 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.420
 flying sees 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.310
 and you have to have this on a server I'm going 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.970
 to put here you have it on a server 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.670
 imagine everything there is a flying penis and 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.060
 we can also do this with is of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.540
 other other entities for example 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.969
 an arrow we'll see until here 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.319
 for here we can do it with him I do not think 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.000
 that this date flies up if not 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.920
 I'm wrong if we were there as we can 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.349
 see here is the icai arrow and it has a 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.269
 face then two points and a 3 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.969
 example we go back to do it there has 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.730
 exactly the same and this the only thing 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.470
 bad is that you can not pick it up is not it 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.209
 only bad that these arrows do not 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.620
 can pick up tell them this is a 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.500
 snapshot so it is understood that still 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.659
 some things are missing this is for 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.060
 erase it how can they also notice 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.639
 we can change the trajectory to the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.099
 arrow for example if I put it here and 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.680
 I think it's here we put and I put a 2 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:23.110
 I think it's going to go over there by the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.120
 other side as you can see from now 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.919
 play everything here we have the arrow as 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.139
 can see there but we can also 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.310
 do it exactly the same only that 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:38.140
 with snow bag like snow world 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.620
 we're not going to put a zero here 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.860
 let's put him here 10 and we're going to 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.840
 remove them and there we have the ball of 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.640
 snow that is falling and good this 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.840
 nap if it is destroyed as you can see 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.760
 there we have the snowball that says 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.740
 two points three quads and is happy and 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.370
 when it falls, they are destroyed 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.050
 this one I do not find much pleasure yet and 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.330
 we can also do exactly what 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.250
 but I think with the balls you're 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.050
 of snow that we have brought the annoying 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.380
 of fire that we have here or until 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.390
 what to see later what can be done in 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.390
 a fire val agreement 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.880
 I do not think you can not with these balls 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.620
 of fire but then with the arrows and with 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.200
 the snowballs if you can like 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.080
 they can write down the moments but good 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.940
 this is basically all the commands of 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.400
 the hue leave a description so that 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.190
 can do all this so much of the 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.110
 named items like these also that 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.260
 they are then to put a flying penis and 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.960
 today this and this one that is to expose 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.180
 an arrow or a in a snowball with 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.730
 name then good trova this description 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.660
 as always so I hope there will be 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.760
 liked 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.310

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.530
 piercer please this one is very 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.030
