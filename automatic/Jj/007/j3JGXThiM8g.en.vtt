00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.960
 everyday in the op der uniklinik tübingen 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.599
 the vascular surgeon josef huber and his 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 Team replace a capped blood vessel 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.569
 by a vascular prosthesis actually one 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.159
 routine intervention but often leads the 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.540
 Vascular replacement to inflammatory reactions 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:37.640
 and clog a new vessel 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.250
 the molecular biologist hans peter wendel 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.470
 and his colleague with the fca dalí 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.810
 look at the vascular surgeon over the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.090
 shoulder the two scientists 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.760
 go to the research lab of the clinic 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.860
 ask about how vascular prostheses go through 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.840
 improve biotechnological methods 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.610
 to let 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.760
 The circulating blood naturally recognizes 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.710
 the foreign body vascular prosthesis and supports 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.990
 on this foreign body around this 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.920
 supposed pathogenic invader 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.840
 to fight 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.960
 That's why we try the surface 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.950
 This vascular prosthesis with finger molecule 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.020
 to coat that cause the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.390
 circulating cells 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.539
 blood for the tube you husband 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.939
 responsible that the plants themselves are 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.640
 we bring the body to the 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.119
 inner wall of this vascular prosthesis this 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.009
 lining the foreign surface so that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.479
 the fabry flowing blood this 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.969
 Surface no longer as foreign 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.500
 surface but as its own 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.659
 body own surface reporting mafia 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.429
 dalí prepares human cells from the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.770
 vessel inner wall so-called 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.110
 endothelial cells for an experiment before 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.459
 These must have an attachment to the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.640
 show vascular prostheses and therefore can 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:02:00.840
 We also try before with these 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.429
 perform key figures from roman veins 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.530
 The cell solution gets into a syringe 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.349
 reared in the one piece of the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.269
 vascular prosthesis is here are some 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.170
 Prostheses with finger molecules 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.700
 coated and some not 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:26.260
 after the procedure, the samples remain for 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:29.019
 Two days in the closet with it 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.579
 has a continuous movements 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.579
 that too a settlement 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.970
 The experiment succeeded in violet 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.389
 Coloring shows that the cells are the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.190
 coated prosthesis 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:49.500
 the uncoated vascular prosthesis 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.500
 looks pale in comparison 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.900
 the right finger molecules too 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.209
 to synthesize and identify 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.450
 a surface of these foreign 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.040
 materials to these prostheses 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.049
 mobilize to dock 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.870
 we have solved that so far in the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.849
 Laboratory scale works very well 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.709
 also the settlement with the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.959
 endothelial cells works completely 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.480
 Outstanding hope that we would 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.849
 the next three to four years like that 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.709
 far, we are the first patients 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.540
 then you can do studies 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.599
 hopefully so promising 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.519
 that we have completely new treatment options for 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.519
 well the patient can offer
