00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
going to medical school and we hope

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.120 
going to medical school and we hope
we'll<00:00:58.930> also<00:00:59.079> then<00:00:59.560> continue<00:00:59.980> on<00:01:00.010> to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
we'll also then continue on to

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.940 
we'll also then continue on to
specialize<00:01:00.700> in<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.240> neurological<00:01:02.110> diseases

specialize in the neurological diseases

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.770 
specialize in the neurological diseases
and<00:01:03.460> neurosurgeons<00:01:04.210> neurologists

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
and neurosurgeons neurologists

psychiatrists

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.600 

I<00:01:08.390> want<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> become<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.500> neurosurgeon<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:10.340> wasn't

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
I want to become a neurosurgeon I wasn't

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.400 
I want to become a neurosurgeon I wasn't
going<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.970> neuroscience<00:01:11.510> field<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.380> I

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
going to a neuroscience field so I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.750 
going to a neuroscience field so I
thought<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:13.220> would<00:01:13.370> be<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.580> good

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
thought that this would be a good

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.600 
thought that this would be a good
opportunity<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.590> showcase<00:01:15.590> my<00:01:16.010> talent<00:01:16.460> or

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
opportunity to showcase my talent or

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.830 
opportunity to showcase my talent or
learn<00:01:17.090> about<00:01:17.360> your<00:01:17.870> science<00:01:25.600> it's<00:01:26.600> pretty

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
learn about your science it's pretty

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.080 
learn about your science it's pretty
tense<00:01:27.140> because<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.980> lot<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.460> people<00:01:28.820> have

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
tense because a lot of people have

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.450 
tense because a lot of people have
studied<00:01:29.660> all<00:01:30.050> year<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.190> pretty

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
studied all year so it's pretty

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.030 
studied all year so it's pretty
competitive<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.450> it's<00:01:32.810> also<00:01:33.040> friendly

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
competitive but it's also friendly

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.860 
competitive but it's also friendly
because<00:01:34.370> we<00:01:34.790> all<00:01:34.910> know<00:01:35.060> it's<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.390> friendly

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
because we all know it's a friendly

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.130 
because we all know it's a friendly
competition<00:01:39.940> we<00:01:40.940> have<00:01:41.060> three<00:01:41.600> rounds<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
competition we have three rounds the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.800 
competition we have three rounds the
first<00:01:42.260> round<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:43.130> thirty<00:01:43.550> questions<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.600> top

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
first round is thirty questions the top

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.950 
first round is thirty questions the top
50%<00:01:45.229> they<00:01:45.920> move<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.460> second<00:01:46.850> round<00:01:46.970> in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
50% they move on to the second round in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.030 
50% they move on to the second round in
the<00:01:48.110> second<00:01:48.380> round<00:01:48.440> we<00:01:48.590> have<00:01:48.680> twenty

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the second round we have twenty

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.650 
the second round we have twenty
questions<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.180> top<00:01:50.360> three

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
questions and then the top three

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.170 
questions and then the top three
students<00:01:51.140> go<00:01:51.350> on<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:52.100> final<00:01:52.790> round<00:01:52.820> where

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
students go on to a final round where

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.270 
students go on to a final round where
there's<00:01:53.330> ten<00:01:53.810> questions<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.890> practice

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
there's ten questions and the practice

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.430 
there's ten questions and the practice
is<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.180> amygdala<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:58.720> guess<00:01:59.720> people<00:01:59.960> are<00:02:00.170> all

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
is the amygdala I guess people are all

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.800 
is the amygdala I guess people are all
the<00:02:00.830> service<00:02:01.550> but<00:02:01.910> they're<00:02:02.060> also<00:02:02.180> pretty

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the service but they're also pretty

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.990 
the service but they're also pretty
excited<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:04.100> people<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:04.550> pretty

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
excited and I think people are pretty

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.960 
excited and I think people are pretty
nice<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.300> each<00:02:05.420> other<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.490> this

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
nice to each other so it is this

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.000 
nice to each other so it is this
understanding<00:02:08.240> stuff<00:02:09.170> instead<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.740> slimmer

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
understanding stuff instead of a slimmer

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.199 
understanding stuff instead of a slimmer
izing<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.300> study<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:11.900> work<00:02:12.170> harder<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
izing and just study and work harder the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.330 
izing and just study and work harder the
level<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.019> knowledge<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:15.830> high<00:02:16.040> school

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
level of knowledge of these high school

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:37.110 
level of knowledge of these high school
students<00:02:16.820> is<00:02:17.180> really<00:02:17.390> really<00:02:18.050> impressive

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.089 

survivor<00:02:38.120> experience<00:02:38.450> like<00:02:38.989> talking<00:02:39.950> with

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
survivor experience like talking with

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.119 
survivor experience like talking with
people<00:02:40.250> who<00:02:40.400> are<00:02:40.519> actually<00:02:40.939> like<00:02:41.090> doing<00:02:41.420> on

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
people who are actually like doing on

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.379 
people who are actually like doing on
research<00:02:43.129> that's<00:02:43.159> being<00:02:43.609> done<00:02:43.939> like<00:02:44.180> right

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
research that's being done like right

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.500 
research that's being done like right
now<00:02:44.799> yes<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:45.980> would<00:02:46.159> recommend<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.849> any<00:02:47.060> high

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
now yes I would recommend it to any high

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.559 
now yes I would recommend it to any high
school<00:02:47.650> students<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:49.519> was<00:02:49.639> a<00:02:49.819> cool<00:02:50.120> event<00:02:50.239> I

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
school students it was a cool event I

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.929 
school students it was a cool event I
enjoyed<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.409> lot<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.920> encourage<00:02:52.489> other<00:02:52.700> people
