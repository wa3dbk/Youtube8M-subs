00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.280
 so hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:10.120
 unboxing the sennheiser pc 360 game 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.999
 Headsets I exchanged now 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.490
 against mainz steelseries siberia headset 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.820
 because the microphone of the steelseries 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.470
 siberia headset not that gentleman gave what 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.320
 I click here I have equipped my cardboard 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.780
 lay on my table here 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.240
 and I will now this this me 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.810
 do not know what that is called in the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:38.530
 technical language but this white goes 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:48.370
 truncate binder and have tesa band 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:51.309
 but here we also solved that 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.239
 I just thought if not anyway 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.089
 ask for an audio freak and the calculator 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.609
 and in addition a good microphone 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.559
 I would like to have quality at water 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:09.009
 then I can sennheiser yes 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.689
 not really wrong so really 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.420
 if you have not asked for parents 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.420
 your enough paper afterwards 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.460
 so and now to the headset 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.540
 Here we told it that pc 360 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.860
 I'll just this whole 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 papers fucking back in the carton 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.520
 stuff my table to that now 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.520
 headset was hidden 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.299
 so then let's see the thing 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.299
 more exactly 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.939
 we are actually right here 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.960
 simple carton so nothing too much 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.090
 big is the headset intuitive volume 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.679
 controller and her cup that is on the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.080
 ear bells I do not know if left or 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.549
 on the right I guess at this place 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.440
 all microphone imamen left ear one 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.290
 small regulator where we have the volume 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.450
 up and down 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.940
 from judith weir boom arm that is 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.209
 micro pulled up micro music xxl caps so 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.640
 so you cups xl so that too 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.019
 over each ear fit now small 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.299
 but really big 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.650
 it would not have to be on the ear 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.160
 but the ear completely 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.160
 enclose festival boom in the proam 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.750
 iclear checks yes the microphone should yes 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.069
 to be really good, I will be right away 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.760
 a microphone test make it to times 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.280
 look 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.620
 and of course it's an open design 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.299
 means it does not close 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.780
 background noise excludes it 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.150
 not much of what I am 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.769
 heard 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.239
 However, that actually does me 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.280
 does not do that personally because of me 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.500
 actually like to hear when we enter 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.060
 room comes but the keyboard I think 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.410
 I will not necessarily be that loud 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.030
 will exclude a bit something 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:22.269
 so I'll get it out of the outer 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.269
 packaging if I knew how to do that 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:34.569
 there, of course, is stuck as stupid 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.840
 we see it is just a simple one 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.840
 black cardboard to make the heap 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:56.050
 want that out of the inside out me 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.250
 Too much violence as you see 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.709
 Do not see anything there is actually 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.630
 nothing but that would have the first 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.370
 really only sennheiser tells that 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.069
 productive in front of australia and lean thanks 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.530
 I do not want to australia case 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.919
 to send my heart back 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:23.440
 so then we have the headset on here 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:31.419
 a stand part , we take the time 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:34.300
 get it off and pick it up here is real 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:39.270
 it's not so much plastic 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.270
 we'll remove that 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.900
 I'm really curious because it's just a stop 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.060
 a hifi sound has and no one no 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.220
 somehow she dot 12 o'clock a shit 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.540
 what other companies will do that 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.280
 sennheiser will sound with a hifi and 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.020
 that 's pretty good 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.860
 as far as I'm concerned so far as I am 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:11.580
 understand is that pc 360 simply one 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.020
 sennheiser hd 558 with the microphone on it 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.950
 I do not know if I'll do it 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.910
 maybe it's different 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.220
 Actually, that is what we will become 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.810
 see 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.770
 I want that from the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.419
 plastic wrap out if I am now 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.690
 get out of the plastic packaging 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.610
 that's real so it's good 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:48.010
 packaged there is nothing to it as well as that 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:51.030
 is packed there is nothing I'm me 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.320
 I'm helpless 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.490
 I'll just cut here 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.570
 and soon the plastic will be down 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.100
 I will connect it afterwards and microphone 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.120
 Do a test because I do not know me 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.630
 it still needs a lot for that 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.930
 complicated 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.990
 we'll get a few by the time we get there 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.930
 days later to the microphone test of the 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.550
 sennheiser pc 360 why do i have that 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.190
 recorded a few days later 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.930
 as that all has as unboxing that 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.760
 a simple reason of my soundcard 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.370
 my boarding pass was in my computer 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.890
 simply absolute bullshit so realtech 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.930
 shit and I have now the asus 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:32.190
 xonar dg 5.1 baptized and as you hear 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.450
 is the microphone of this headset 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.300
 outstanding so I can not now 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.310
 headset somehow think of something 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.220
 has better microphone than this headset 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.590
 it's really important to partially 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.570
 on cheap large membrane microphones ran 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.190
 if I put on such a thing now 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.090
 head protection could have that one with itself 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.419
 the 5th 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.480
 where to buy then I think that this 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:58.090
 headset really top let's play is capable 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.320
 and the sound quality is gradually decreasing 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.540
 three four days as easy 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.820
 This makes a real headway for gaming 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.440
 headset really absolute 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.990
 buy recommendation for this headset me 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.410
 Can you only guess it is 170 euros 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.910
 Worth really so hit us as long as we can 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.080
 still can as long as that still exists and 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.030
 has not been overtaken 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.350
 buy the thing I say thank you 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.350
 for watching and see you next time
