thousand<00:04:56.500> coins<00:04:56.680> from<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.480> I<00:04:58.510> kind<00:04:59.440> of

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
thousand coins from that so I kind of

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.590 
thousand coins from that so I kind of
lost<00:04:59.800> coins<00:05:00.190> on<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.580> doing<00:05:00.850> this<00:05:01.000> collection
