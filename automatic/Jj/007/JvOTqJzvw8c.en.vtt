00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 virtua tennis 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.210

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 quite simply 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.260
 a sky 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.450

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.829
 so I preferred to go to the private 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.479
 I count 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.719
