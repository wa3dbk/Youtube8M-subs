00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

happens in it in the way of you know
growth<00:00:41.250> along<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> bottom<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.480> anything<00:00:42.860> they

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
growth along the bottom or anything they

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.819 
growth along the bottom or anything they
just<00:00:43.890> sit<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.930> after<00:00:46.620> about

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
just sit there and then after about

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.869 
just sit there and then after about
three<00:00:47.129> weeks<00:00:48.050> they<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.590> take<00:00:49.860> off<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
three weeks they just take off and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479 
three weeks they just take off and
that's<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:51.989> building<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> root

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that's because they are building a root

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
that's because they are building a root
system<00:00:53.760> they're<00:00:54.180> pretty<00:00:54.480> strong<00:00:57.410> they<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
system they're pretty strong they have a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
system they're pretty strong they have a
pretty<00:00:59.129> strong<00:00:59.370> root<00:00:59.609> system<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.989> just

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
pretty strong root system and they just

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
pretty strong root system and they just
need<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> establish<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:03.449> they

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
need to establish that and then they

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.330 
need to establish that and then they
just<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:05.750> get<00:01:06.750> internet<00:01:07.500> works<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.860> efolio

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just go get internet works on efolio

and this guy is really turning red just
about<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.790> think<00:03:01.329> it's<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
about I think it's just about the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.680 
about I think it's just about the
reddest<00:03:02.680> looked<00:03:03.459> v<00:03:03.670> Kia<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:03.940> can<00:03:04.269> get<00:03:04.450> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
reddest looked v Kia you can get and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.259 
reddest looked v Kia you can get and
it's<00:03:04.840> even<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.500> easiest<00:03:06.010> grows<00:03:06.940> really<00:03:07.120> fast

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
it's even the easiest grows really fast

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's even the easiest grows really fast
and<00:03:08.250> once<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.459> done<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.920> funny<00:03:12.190> thing<00:03:12.400> about

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
and once it's done the funny thing about

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.890 
and once it's done the funny thing about
this<00:03:12.790> plant<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.269> even<00:03:13.980> even<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.250> petioles

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
this plant is even even the petioles

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.449 
this plant is even even the petioles
which<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.799> stem<00:03:18.160> between<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:19.950> way<00:03:20.950> is

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
which is the stem between the way is

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.400 
which is the stem between the way is
that<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.209> part<00:03:22.480> between<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.900> stem<00:03:23.170> and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
that it's a part between the stem and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.319 
that it's a part between the stem and
the<00:03:23.620> leaves<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:24.160> little<00:03:24.400> stalk<00:03:24.790> there<00:03:25.060> that's

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
the leaves a little stalk there that's

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.270
