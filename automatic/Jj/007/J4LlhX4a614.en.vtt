interested in MGS 2 episode 6 and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
interested in MGS 2 episode 6 and
something<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.490> I've<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> time<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
something that I've had a lot of time to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.920 
something that I've had a lot of time to
think<00:01:10.380> about<00:01:10.650> entirely<00:01:11.610> too<00:01:12.180> much<00:01:12.360> time<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
think about entirely too much time to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
think about entirely too much time to
think<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> think

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
think about really and the more I think

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.249 
think about really and the more I think
about<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.659> needs<00:01:18.900> revision<00:01:19.909> so

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
about it the more it needs revision so

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.050 
about it the more it needs revision so
that'll<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.680> delayed<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.850> while

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that'll probably be delayed for a while

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
that'll probably be delayed for a while
I<00:01:24.439> don't<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.369> long<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> other

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I don't really know how long the other

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.920 
I don't really know how long the other
than<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.549> there's<00:01:29.909> also<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:31.820> one-shot<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
than that there's also a one-shot that I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.219 
than that there's also a one-shot that I
had<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> tubes<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> while<00:01:35.250> um

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
had in the tubes for a while um

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.219 
had in the tubes for a while um
basically<00:01:37.850> back<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.150> started<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.049> was

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
basically back when I started it it was

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.130 
basically back when I started it it was
to<00:01:40.530> sort<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.180> dragged<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.869> little

editing rut which now obviously it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.730 
editing rut which now obviously it
didn't<00:01:46.560> work<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.600> maybe<00:01:48.600> second<00:01:49.409> time's<00:01:49.619> the
