00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello I'm a rich marco while you're there 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.660
 I welcome you to my site 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.809
 web and I deal with mental coaching of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.130
 mental training for sportsmen 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.599
 mental training is nothing more 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 nothing less than training 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.920
 tactical technician you do with the mister ho 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.039
 to the athletic training you do with the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 athletic trainer during the sessions 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 and mental coaching deals with 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 train the mind but in reality 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.970
 we use the word mind a little bit 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.579
 convention because we all train 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 those aspects are the requirements that the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
 make up 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.950
 for example, emotions and states 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.520
 of mind the mental film dialogue 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 inner 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 the attitude the character the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.700
 behavior all the requirements 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.700
 important that serve to do well 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 if you are the sportsman 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 I bet he knows at least one athlete 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.329
 that particular time he had 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 the feeling in advance of how 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.440
 he would have played that game 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.620
 exactly knows how important it is 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.780
 be at your best when you need it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.240
 what to do as many athletes do yes 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.189
 literally let fall by 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.799
 events from the importance of the occasion 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.500
 from the pressure of the moment from the mail 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.640
 up for grabs rather than from the audience 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.439
 tv from the media or from newspapers and the goal 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.540
 coaching takes care of training all 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.150
 these components to let me 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.210
 find myself in the right place at the moment 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 right with the right mood with i 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.110
 mental films reinforcing with dialogue 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 strong inner and with attitude 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.070
 quite right 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.079
 many athletes and many sportsmen believe 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.630
 that all this must be innate e 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.250
 natural wellness or you have it or you don't 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.350
 you have 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.060
 in reality all this can be trained 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 all this can be improved 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.439
 putting into practice just a pinch 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.549
 of good will and a little dedication to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.140
 improvement 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.880
 my role is to support one 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.840
 sports is the whole build a 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.039
 path of this type if you want more
