00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:05.790
 In addition, the whole shop base where the explanation of the motherboard was done ends 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.790
 If it is next, it is the case of PC case 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.459
 Dog and haste 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.009
 Do not leave it as it is created as confidential information 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.039
 It is always attached to the interface panel etc. 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.849
 Yes this is 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.910
 It is to be a burden when you say 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.829
 Install 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.839
 It's a close-up so you can see it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.420
 Wintering 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.710
 Here are some of them 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.810

 I'm going to go ぇ iron with mouse and keyboard 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.680
 That Ana 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.690
 In the literature 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.020
 Become 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.079
 Mama 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.100
 It may be a memorial but I'm talking 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.650
 I think it was over US time 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.270
 Exhausted to rice flour 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.649
 Because it was made 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.649
 Please go ahead 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.220
 Cach 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.410
 Isolated 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.600
 Separately 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.090
 Hit here 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 Thoroughly 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 Motherboard 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.080
 In this work 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330
 I plow 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.520
 Always on the motherboard 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.860
 Other than this 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.440
 According to the fixed hole 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.950
 Be sure to install this space guard 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.450
 It is all in the other PC case 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.789
 I'm talking about that prediction, and the global environment is at once 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.020
 Though 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.220
 Excuse me 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 There is also a plastic plug-in type 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.830
 I am Akafuku 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.370
 It seems that it went to offer 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.780
 I've always been 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 In other cases 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.910
 Then it becomes like that, but cheap pc case 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.580
 was 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 It becomes an exchange space 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.049
 Why is it that the motherboard is ready to be installed 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.689
 Will be 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.689
 It is motherboard metropolitan system 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.229
 I do not have to do it after interface 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.529
 Do you laugh at the interface panel? 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.599
 I went to the top page presented files and with foreign countries 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.209
 A stand that was light 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.579
 Yes, the riot police will start, so be careful 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.659
 It is not always the case that you can insert it. 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.249
 Hey that 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.129
 Since there is a start in the interface panel 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.870
 Just a bit 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.809
 Both live 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.219
 It is an image romi 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.819
 If you have a good motherboard to enter, Atsugiba 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.379
 I'm going to screw up 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.719
 But first 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.109
 I was holding it by hand 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.189
 Please borrow 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 I saw it 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.979
 I think this person is an easy win, even if it is not triple 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.429
 It is feeling 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.779
 that 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.779
 Itano of flight earlier 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.539
 url 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.989
 With format reset 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.989
 Hard disk access lamp 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.319
 President Babinejad 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.720
 It is a director 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.890
 Is it a feeling of theft 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.129
 Eco friendly 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.769
 If it only clears 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.169
 It is not difficult to report that it is self-made 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.479
 It became so-called but what to do with fox 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.969
 By self-made walking 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.909
 If you are making your own for the first time 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.740
 It's a really self-made kit 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.819
 Prime Minister in Chiba accreditation problem 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.229
 I'm looking at tapes here 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.440
 Is it to be an ie or cret? 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.710
 Model of lga 775 or more 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.629

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.629
 Main school 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.870
 I think the team was there 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.060
 Rocky Interface I think that the Emperor Prize Spring 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.729
 is not it 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.360
 I think only one will be open to the meeting 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.229
 I think there is Akashi, but it is mainstream 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.789
 I can do serial ata Boston serial 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.439
 I got old 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.020
 was 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.039
 At first it is called congruence 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.449
 It is inconceivable 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.460
 It's easy 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.830
 I'm out of breath
