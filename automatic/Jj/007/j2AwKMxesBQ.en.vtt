00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 every year gardeners and and lovers 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 extreme sports 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.760
 for the first time cling to the car trailer 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 not having an idea of how 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.780
 it went dangerously with sending me a goat 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 Well, in fact, it is not difficult to need 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 just remember that with your trailer 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.760
 the car is longer still the trailer is prone to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.160
 drift 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.410
 reluctantly stops and may 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.779
 damage but already machine is easy 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.750
 You say you can park a trailer and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 manually this trailer starts to carry 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 literally out of the blue and the driver doesn't 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.960
 only 5 seconds to fix 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.379
 and swinging lisipp recipe with a load 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 flips over to yourself voted flips noo 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.989
 why 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.969
 dramatically rebuilt or even just 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.070
 slowed the skid then handle not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 hard but i'm not sure i can 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.440
 but now and check which one of you 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.719
 summer resident only in a straight walk and turn 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.489
 do not damage your car to the finish 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.670
 permitted speed of 7 kilometers an hour 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.449
 I know 20 less everyone usually exactly there 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.100
 everything is ok 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.100
 brother all right bread 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:23.350
 so turn reset speed real 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:26.259
 brakes in turn folded in half well 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.039
 here you go to the dacha wing bumper 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.740
 trailer twist lost what I did wrong 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.619
 Well, first of all, too tightly pressed 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.049
 turn left your classes to the left 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.649
 car with a trailer wider therefore in 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.590
 turnaround 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.929
 leave lateral spacing more then 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.390
 there is if I turn left and oak in 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.060
 the arc is more to the right and vice versa 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.280
 a skid he could have tipped over yes you 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.640
 fulfilled the most common mistake 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.360
 began to brake in turn and the trailer 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 do not forgive such maneuvers 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.119
 turns with a trailer need on stable 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.019
 speeds without reducing them or raising them otherwise 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.759
 he will drag you away so slowed down 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.450
 and turned and if all the same trailer 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.660
 starts to shake from side to side 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.709
 everything is very simple you need to press the gas 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.670
 enter the turn 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.489
 push to achieve and no splinter 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.500
 all it turns out well is that 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.209
 Anything else you advise beginner 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 machinists author search 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.200
 keep your distance many of their trailers 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.599
 just no brakes so brake 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 road course is longer and much more as well 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.709
 let's check accelerates to 70 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.519
 kilometers per hour and near the entry 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.519
 start to slow down 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.980
 wow 8 meters difference and remember that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.410
 on a car with a trailer you need to brake 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.250
 as smoothly as possible 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.250
 passed 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.360
 so ja tu twist 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.360
 everything 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.950
 applause 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.440
 if your trailer is not in a hurry
