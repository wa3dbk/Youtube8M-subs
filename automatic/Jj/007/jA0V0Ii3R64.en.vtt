00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
so it doesn't make crushed ice so it was

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.209 
so it doesn't make crushed ice so it was
worth<00:00:12.940> it<00:00:13.119> to<00:00:13.180> me<00:00:13.449> to<00:00:13.660> buy<00:00:13.959> something<00:00:14.650> to<00:00:14.949> crush

so if it does not crush ice I'm going to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:46.290 
so if it does not crush ice I'm going to
take<00:00:35.050> it<00:00:35.200> back<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:37.020> opening<00:00:38.020> it<00:00:45.120> that's<00:00:46.120> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.390 

and<00:01:15.920> then<00:01:16.040> on<00:01:16.160> this<00:01:16.340> side<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.750> cup<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:19.280> a

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
and then on this side is the cup it's a

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.020 
and then on this side is the cup it's a
pretty<00:01:19.580> decent<00:01:19.790> sized<00:01:20.180> cup<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.630> think<00:01:20.900> and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
pretty decent sized cup I think and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.430 
pretty decent sized cup I think and
there's<00:01:23.030> where<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.330> blender<00:01:23.780> goes<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.320> then

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
there's where the blender goes and then

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.410 
there's where the blender goes and then
you<00:01:24.470> screw<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.070> off<00:01:25.220> I'm<00:01:25.490> assuming<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.210> put

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you screw it off I'm assuming and put

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
the very top and if it doesn't blend

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.880

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
then I want it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.020 
then I want it
alright<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> next<00:02:31.160> thing<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.520> do<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.730> you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
alright so the next thing you do is you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.640 
alright so the next thing you do is you
take<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.360> part<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.810> has<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.260> spinning

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
take the part that has the spinning

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:43.030 
take the part that has the spinning
blades<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:36.440> screw<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.760> way<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
blades and you screw that this way it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.100 
blades and you screw that this way it
looks<00:02:43.070> like<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:43.400> gonna<00:02:43.550> be<00:02:43.640> too<00:02:43.970> big

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
looks like it's gonna be too big

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.110 
looks like it's gonna be too big
make<00:02:45.350> sure<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.709> nice<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:45.980> tight<00:02:46.400> then

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
make sure it's on nice and tight then

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
make sure it's on nice and tight then
the<00:02:47.239> way<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.450> understand<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:49.900> it's<00:02:50.900> gonna<00:02:51.050> be

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the way I understand it is it's gonna be

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.520 
the way I understand it is it's gonna be
loud<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.880> may<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.750> pause<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.170> after<00:02:54.440> it

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
loud so we may have to pause it after it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.860 
loud so we may have to pause it after it
goes<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.550> for<00:02:56.150> my<00:02:56.239> understanding<00:02:56.480> you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
goes so for my understanding you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.479 
goes so for my understanding you

as<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.190> put<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.460> cremated<00:04:10.940> ice<00:04:12.220> pick<00:04:13.220> up<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:14.090> I

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
as I put the cremated ice pick up and I

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.920 
as I put the cremated ice pick up and I
kept<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.570> big<00:04:14.810> chunks<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:15.890> here<00:04:16.630> I'm<00:04:17.630> gonna<00:04:17.720> do

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
kept the big chunks in here I'm gonna do

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:27.990 
kept the big chunks in here I'm gonna do
with<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.200> same<00:04:18.380> thing<00:04:18.560> again

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:46.930 

there's<00:04:29.000> an<00:04:29.090> arrow<00:04:44.260> all<00:04:45.260> right<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.940> guess

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
there's an arrow all right I guess

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.860 
there's an arrow all right I guess
that's<00:04:47.150> good<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:49.270> might<00:04:50.270> be<00:04:50.419> taking<00:04:50.780> this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
that's good so I might be taking this

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.330 
that's good so I might be taking this
back<00:04:51.110> because<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:52.010> don't<00:04:52.250> wanted<00:04:52.639> crushed<00:04:53.240> ice

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
back because I don't wanted crushed ice

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.790 
back because I don't wanted crushed ice
and<00:04:55.340> rain<00:04:55.580> not<00:04:56.510> snow<00:04:56.540> but<00:04:57.260> like<00:04:57.290> look<00:04:57.560> at<00:04:57.650> that

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
and rain not snow but like look at that

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.570 
and rain not snow but like look at that
that's<00:04:57.980> pulverized<00:04:59.139> that's<00:05:00.139> pretty<00:05:00.320> good

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
that's pulverized that's pretty good

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.969 
that's pulverized that's pretty good
I'll<00:05:01.580> try<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.090> drink<00:05:02.450> with<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.139> see<00:05:03.770> if<00:05:03.860> I

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
I'll try a drink with it and see if I

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.440 
I'll try a drink with it and see if I
like<00:05:04.010> it<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.580> then<00:05:04.669> I'll<00:05:04.790> get<00:05:04.940> back<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.180> you

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
like it and then I'll get back to you

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.610 
like it and then I'll get back to you
because<00:05:05.630> I'm<00:05:05.840> not<00:05:05.990> sure<00:05:06.940> I'm<00:05:07.940> gonna<00:05:08.060> keep<00:05:08.270> it

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
because I'm not sure I'm gonna keep it

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.620 
because I'm not sure I'm gonna keep it
so<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.800> ice<00:05:09.950> is<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.340> little<00:05:10.669> thinner<00:05:11.060> than<00:05:11.570> I

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
so the ice is a little thinner than I

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.560 
so the ice is a little thinner than I
like<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:13.220> do<00:05:13.550> believe<00:05:13.850> I'm<00:05:14.150> going<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.330> keep

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
like but I do believe I'm going to keep

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.170 
like but I do believe I'm going to keep
it<00:05:14.810> it's<00:05:15.169> still<00:05:15.410> nice<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.830> chew<00:05:16.130> on<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:17.000> it

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
it it's still nice to chew on and it

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.110 
it it's still nice to chew on and it
makes<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:17.570> softer<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.460> think<00:05:19.880> I'm

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
makes it softer so I think I'm

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.719 
makes it softer so I think I'm
definitely<00:05:20.450> gonna<00:05:20.510> keep<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.960> for<00:05:21.200> $20<00:05:22.130> on<00:05:22.400> sale

definitely gonna keep it for $20 on sale

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.080 
definitely gonna keep it for $20 on sale
