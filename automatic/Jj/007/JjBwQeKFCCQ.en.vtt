00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello I would like I am the creator 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 and the pastry workshop of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.360
 cakes and today I can present 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.950
 for me we make chouquettes then 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.299
 now to straighten the shoes 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 plate what it takes already is a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.470
 plate and especially not a grid so 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.859
 a flat we will cover with paper 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.859
 greaseproof 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 then we will put the dough in a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590
 pocket with a boil obviously 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.790
 we could have done to help proud but 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.290
 for sure the result will not be 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
 everything while they try to use 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.129
 a page that will look like this and a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.239
 sleeve that looks like that then 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 to do the things you need 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 it is a smooth socket and at the level of the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.059
 German diameter is written on it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.510
 to make crazy by the chouquettes 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.640
 you need 12 mm diameter or 15 mm 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.690
 of diameter at the level of the pockets as 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 that will get you into some 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.899
 specialty shops if you do not have it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.180
 not nothing prevents you from taking a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.370
 big freezer bag so enough 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 thick and good quality so the principle 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 is time to cut off the end and the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.619
 cozy mattress inside there for 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.510
 security reasons we will come 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.850
 close the page that squeezed one end 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.830
 of plastic and in fact we will do this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 we call the skirt the skirt that goes 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:26.700
 allow you to garnish the clean pocket 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:29.700
 camp then we go back the age he is there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 just pull on the socket and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.509
 to go up the slope until then 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.619
 now we will do little 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.670
 horses because I remind you that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.110
 the chouquettes is a little bite 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.070
 so do not do them too much 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 large 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.700
 so the idea is close it's so 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.130
 with your fingers so you squeeze yourself 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.939
 have your little cabbage or press when 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.229
 it's the right size 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.540
 we release completely from the pressure 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.220
 and we direct man u 13 to the surface a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.450
 once the saq is over when you 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.920
 go watch if you have small 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.420
 points like that in the beginning it's from the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.729
 then remove to remove them we take 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 a glass of water with the fork we go 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.290
 deceive the fork of antwerp and there 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.820
 simply come crush the cabbage in 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.290
 area 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.349
 so too must not press it on 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.240
 principle it's just in bellac suspense 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.560
 it's not flattening it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.819
 and finally before putting them in 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 the fake must not forget but the sugar 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.239
 because sugar always smiles before 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.040
 cooking of course these rich have fled 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 but it's because we did not stick anymore 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.920
 what is needed is brown sugar 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.510
 the obstacle exists several sizes of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 sugar grains where we wanted bigger 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.380
 or more fine so now it's written 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.130
 above a special support chouquettes 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.489
 so here we will come to rodez 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.489
 chouquettes 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.380
 we see that excess sugar and removed 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.710
 his business is that we will put them to 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.300
 cook 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.880
 so that's pretty hot so 1 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.800
 195 degrees for about 13 to 14 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.790
 minutes then not hesitate to stay in front 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.170
 to see what's going on in your 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.660
 oven because once it's too much 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.400
 burnt there is nothing more to do open his 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.630
 needs before and when is it killing you 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.970
 to the error it starts slightly at 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.090
 caramelize on the epic and include it and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.500
 it's very good so here we wait for them 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.420
 chouquettes have arrived so you see 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.700
 it has caramelized on the side and 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.380
 on it then the chouquette is eaten 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.430
 minutes we do not plan to do it for 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.920
 the rest of the scene where she 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.020
 luckily that's going to be eating in the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.620
 day and it stays good 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.620
 crisp
