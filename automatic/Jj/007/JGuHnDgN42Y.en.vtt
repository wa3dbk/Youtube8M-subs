00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello everyone this is my first loquendo 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.389
 for this new channel before I had a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.280
 channel but I deleted it good without more the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.530
 treatment of circus animals is 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.109
 modified as the attitude in front 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.029
 the animals also changed but the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.859
 animal rights activists and the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 trainers of these animals do not 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 agree about the truth that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.109
 finds behind the methods of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 training that are used and if still 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 you should use the animals to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.560
 entertain the humans the circuses still 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 they use training methods 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 humanitarian aid based on 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.680
 behavior of the animal's innate 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.719
 activists claim that these animals 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.989
 of circus are forced to perform tricks 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.370
 unnatural through fear 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 history to the history of circuses is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 traces back to ancient egypt greece and rome 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.539
 the maximum Roman circus was the place in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.309
 where shows were offered 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 entertainment for the masses in 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.480
 outdoor spaces and included 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 battle scenes acrobats and others 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.609
 artists and of course shows with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.040
 animals many circuses presented 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.750
 exotic animals trained to act 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 in front of the crowd 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 fall of the empire of Rome ' meant the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.500
 deterioration of the circus that became 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.510
 independent artists wandering up 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.690
 that the 18th century was organized the first 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.580
 traveling circus positive stimulus the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.860
 circuses like the ringling brothers and the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.410
 non-profit organizations like 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.510
 The European Circus Association supports the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.190
 positive stimulus and repetition like 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.420
 training methods for 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.430
 animals 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 The positive stimulus consists of rewarding 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.660
 to the animal if it behaves in the way 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.430
 desired instead of punishing him for not 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.979
 perform the trick or force it with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.720
 cruelty to do so much in circus 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.340
 ringling and the circus association 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.410
 they claim that the tricks that they 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.270
 practice are based on the capabilities 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.180
 natural and physical condition of the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.979
 animals the association also imposes a 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.660
 code of conduct that requires the use 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.759
 of trained personnel for the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.860
 regular exercise training and 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.770
 veterinary care for animals 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 of circuses negative stimulus to what 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.759
 throughout history the coaches of 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 animals in the circuses used the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.869
 method of punishment to force the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.690
 animals to perform tricks by means of 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.050
 fear many humanitarian groups among 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.510
 they 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.120
 and first of all the group of people 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.710
 for the ethical treatment of animals 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 they argue that these methods persist 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.940
 currently together with other types 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.890
 of abuse like that of nature 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.030
 inherently transient of a circus 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.920
 walking 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 these groups documented the use of 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 whips electric prods and hooks with 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.490
 school point for training 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.800
 they also recorded several coaches 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.740
 while explaining how to terrify the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.630
 animals to submit them future the 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.130
 campaigns carried out by groups of 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.290
 defense and fundamental changes 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.210
 about the way it is perceived and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.920
 treats the animals generated 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.540
 stricter regulations and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.370
 Total bans on 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.160
 shows with animals throughout 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.980
 world costa rica- singapore sweden 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.900
 finland india and austria have 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.300
 national laws as well as 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.700
 US municipalities and districts in 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.210
 Australia Argentina Brazil Canada 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.270
 colombia and greece however the public 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.010
 still go to the circus to see animals 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.960
 support humanitarian training by 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.970
 means of regulation and sponsorship 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.500
 the circuses that use those methods can 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.040
 influence the way he 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.830
 that performs the circuses well in this what 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.930
 said I add something more the coach 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.000
 he needs more knowledge instead of 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.700
 look empirically for behavior 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.650
 every living thing comes from an engineering 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.640
 biological based on natural laws 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.260
 existing goodbye would help me a lot that
