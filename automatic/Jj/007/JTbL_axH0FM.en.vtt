00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 super crazy experience audacious neither 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.970
 all our audacious using in two 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.710
 legs and jealous of four years one 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 Artist tightrope that defies 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.570
 death in the united kingdom the play begins well 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.890
 simple a two-legged dog in the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.890
 Nothing impressive rope 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.890
 he suddenly jumps is a dog 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.900
 acrobat amazing juggler who but 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 It's cool to see a dog on the rope. 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.579
 Bamba is a dog with all four legs. 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.200
 on the tightrope I was impressed 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.840
 then stands as if balancing on 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.570
 two legs on a rope being a dog 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.430
 or the question so we went until night 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.280
 in england win ozzy at its best 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.469
 friend nick johnson to discover I 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.770
 I find it cheap to see the oasis balancing 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.070
 he does it very well then we both 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 This is an example of a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 dog on the tightrope or will be a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.039
 example of this guy showing his 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.379
 general powers 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.360
 will anyone be the master geday or 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.000
 science is there said 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.920
 This is very difficult for a dog. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.320
 they do not have the same on Sunday 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.509
 animals that live on tree limbs 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 long and hands grasping like primates 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.229
 I was not even stuck the dog has nothing 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.369
 Just like us when we walk in the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 tightrope 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.299
 we have to distribute the weight further 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 the center of gravity of the point 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.670
 central axis if you prefer the ovi to do 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.409
 just stretch your tail as much as you can 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 he has to make several small 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 adjustments to keep the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.759
 belts on the rope he is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.710
 at a disadvantage but still manages to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.680
 I think that few dogs in the world can 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.570
 to do this but how did 11 barked at 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.990
 face of biology and physics to do 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.909
 this spectacular balance trick is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 an awesome feat 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.619
 I think the first one is about a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.390
 intelligent breed is a shepherd dog and they 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.340
 tend to be 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.159
 and he trained him with 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.229
 various rewards conditioned you today 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.209
 Do not know what will win but you know 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.130
 Something cool is going to happen to him. 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.709
 very well 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.880
 the next step of ozzy is to try the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.320
 female world record on the tightrope 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.320
 Hoss, my congratulations
