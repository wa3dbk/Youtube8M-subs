00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
according to my calculations the Box cut

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.709 
according to my calculations the Box cut
is<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.579> most<00:00:36.789> aerodynamic<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:40.120> will<00:00:40.360> fly

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
is the most aerodynamic it will fly

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.010 
is the most aerodynamic it will fly
better<00:00:41.079> we'll<00:00:41.920> see<00:00:42.100> about<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.370> I<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.870> the
