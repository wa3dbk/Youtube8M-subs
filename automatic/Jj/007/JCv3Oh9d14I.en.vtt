00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
android for all I guess so yeah here's a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.360 
android for all I guess so yeah here's a
look<00:02:36.090> at<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.330> folders<00:02:37.220> nothing<00:02:38.220> too

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
look at the folders nothing too

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.730 
look at the folders nothing too
outrageous<00:02:38.819> at<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> folder<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.140> put<00:02:40.319> apps<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
outrageous at the folder and put apps in

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.059 
outrageous at the folder and put apps in
it<00:02:41.420> keeps<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.569> from<00:02:42.720> having<00:02:43.069> complete

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
it keeps you from having complete

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.240 
it keeps you from having complete
overload<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.640> apps<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:45.030> every<00:02:45.240> screen<00:02:46.250> there's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
overload of apps on every screen there's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.300 
overload of apps on every screen there's
the<00:02:47.459> status<00:02:47.790> notification<00:02:48.510> widget

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the status notification widget

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.670 
the status notification widget
so<00:02:51.209> what<00:02:51.330> else<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.569> starving<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> settings<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so what else is starving the settings a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.479 
so what else is starving the settings a
bit<00:02:55.670> new<00:02:56.670> settings<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.920> yes<00:02:58.920> indefinite

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
bit new settings are yes indefinite

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.610 
bit new settings are yes indefinite
definitely<00:03:00.090> UI<00:03:00.270> changes<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.349> this<00:03:01.470> is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
definitely UI changes here so this is

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.030 
definitely UI changes here so this is
the<00:03:01.709> data<00:03:01.950> usage<00:03:02.569> icon<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:04.349> they<00:03:04.500> show<00:03:05.010> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the data usage icon that they show it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.870 
the data usage icon that they show it
off<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.540> set<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.840> mobile<00:03:06.989> data<00:03:07.349> limit

good stuff to get oh and in fact let's

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.330 
good stuff to get oh and in fact let's
let's<00:04:24.510> try<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.350> having<00:04:25.590> some<00:04:25.800> Samsung

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
let's try so it's having some Samsung

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.010 
let's try so it's having some Samsung
devices<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.940> galaxy<00:04:27.360> s2<00:04:27.479> you<00:04:27.720> could<00:04:27.870> just

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
devices like a galaxy s2 you could just

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.600 
devices like a galaxy s2 you could just
hit<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.289> power<00:04:28.590> button<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.100> home<00:04:29.340> button

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
hit the power button and a home button

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.060 
hit the power button and a home button
down<00:04:29.910> here<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:30.780> would<00:04:30.900> take<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.440> screen

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
down here and it would take a screen

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.469 
down here and it would take a screen
capture<00:04:32.100> but<00:04:32.700> there's<00:04:32.850> obviously<00:04:33.180> no

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
capture but there's obviously no

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.600 
capture but there's obviously no
physical<00:04:33.990> home<00:04:34.169> button<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.280> if<00:04:35.580> we

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
physical home button on this so if we

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.490 
physical home button on this so if we
hit<00:04:35.789> the<00:04:35.940> power<00:04:36.210> button<00:04:36.360> over<00:04:37.020> here<00:04:37.050> and

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
hit the power button over here and

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.029 
hit the power button over here and
volume<00:04:38.070> down<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.370> believe<00:04:39.650> let's<00:04:40.650> see<00:04:40.889> if<00:04:40.979> this

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
volume down I believe let's see if this

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.469 
volume down I believe let's see if this
is<00:04:41.190> enabled

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.540 

there<00:04:45.479> goes<00:04:45.810> right<00:04:46.259> there<00:04:46.530> okay<00:04:47.009> so<00:04:47.460> you

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
there goes right there okay so you

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.790 
there goes right there okay so you
actually<00:04:47.699> have<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.150> hold<00:04:48.389> that<00:04:48.569> so<00:04:49.169> screenshot

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
actually have to hold that so screenshot

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.950 
actually have to hold that so screenshot
shaved<00:04:50.129> to<00:04:50.370> gallery<00:04:50.729> there<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.810> actually

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
shaved to gallery there you actually

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.990 
shaved to gallery there you actually
have<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.319> hold<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.889> bit<00:04:53.159> longer<00:04:53.400> than<00:04:53.789> you

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
have to hold that a bit longer than you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.610 
have to hold that a bit longer than you
do<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.389> galaxy<00:04:54.750> s2<00:04:54.870> but<00:04:55.199> that's<00:04:55.349> probably

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
do on the galaxy s2 but that's probably

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.499 
do on the galaxy s2 but that's probably
a<00:04:55.919> good<00:04:56.129> thing<00:04:56.460> so<00:04:56.520> in<00:04:56.759> your<00:04:56.879> pocket<00:04:57.210> you<00:04:57.330> just

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
a good thing so in your pocket you just

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.969 
a good thing so in your pocket you just
don't<00:04:57.659> take<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> ton<00:04:58.169> of<00:04:58.199> screen<00:04:58.500> grabs<00:04:58.770> so

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
don't take a ton of screen grabs so

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.369 
don't take a ton of screen grabs so
that's<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.340> maybe<00:04:59.520> one<00:05:00.240> or<00:05:00.360> two<00:05:00.389> seconds<00:05:00.840> very

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
that's a maybe one or two seconds very

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.189 
that's a maybe one or two seconds very
obvious<00:05:01.889> when<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:02.819> is<00:05:02.940> saved<00:05:03.180> one<00:05:03.389> so<00:05:03.930> that's

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
obvious when it is saved one so that's

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.450 
obvious when it is saved one so that's
convenience<00:05:04.650> convenient<00:05:05.039> for<00:05:05.129> people<00:05:05.220> like

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
convenience convenient for people like

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.790 
convenience convenient for people like
us<00:05:05.520> but<00:05:05.849> if<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.060> want<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.379> take<00:05:07.379> a<00:05:07.409> picture<00:05:07.770> of

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.980 
us but if you want to take a picture of
something<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.879> you<00:05:09.210> know<00:05:09.389> someone<00:05:09.750> just<00:05:09.780> a

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
something and you know someone just a

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.499 
something and you know someone just a
screenshot<00:05:10.289> that's<00:05:10.940> very<00:05:11.940> convenient<00:05:12.300> way<00:05:12.449> to

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
screenshot that's very convenient way to

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.200 
screenshot that's very convenient way to
do<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.289> power<00:05:13.500> button<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:14.099> located<00:05:14.819> here

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
do it the power button is located here

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.610 
do it the power button is located here
on<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:16.650> edge<00:05:17.720> nothing<00:05:18.720> on<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.960> top<00:05:19.139> actually

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
on the edge nothing on the top actually

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.550 
on the edge nothing on the top actually
because<00:05:19.889> it's<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.720> tamper<00:05:21.720> taper<00:05:21.930> down<00:05:22.080> there

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
because it's a tamper taper down there

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.990 
because it's a tamper taper down there
so<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.800> guess<00:05:23.039> they<00:05:23.190> couldn't<00:05:23.370> fit<00:05:23.580> much<00:05:23.729> on<00:05:23.909> the

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
so I guess they couldn't fit much on the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.480 
so I guess they couldn't fit much on the
top<00:05:26.930> clicking<00:05:27.930> on<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.199> side<00:05:28.500> that's<00:05:29.190> the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
top clicking on this side that's the

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.520 
top clicking on this side that's the
volume<00:05:29.819> rocker<00:05:29.849> really<00:05:30.840> understated<00:05:31.319> design

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
volume rocker really understated design

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.779 
volume rocker really understated design
I<00:05:32.190> think<00:05:33.000> this<00:05:33.690> battery<00:05:34.400> compartment<00:05:35.400> yeah<00:05:35.610> I

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
I think this battery compartment yeah I

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.680 
I think this battery compartment yeah I
supposed<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.120> be<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.270> bit<00:05:36.449> flusher<00:05:36.780> there<00:05:37.259> we<00:05:37.349> go

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
supposed to be a bit flusher there we go

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.110 
supposed to be a bit flusher there we go
so<00:05:39.690> there's<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.349> memory<00:05:41.159> USB<00:05:41.340> port<00:05:41.879> and<00:05:42.030> the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
so there's the memory USB port and the

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.930 
so there's the memory USB port and the
headphone<00:05:42.750> jack<00:05:42.780> is<00:05:43.229> on<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.860> bottom<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.819> the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
headphone jack is on the bottom of the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.490 
headphone jack is on the bottom of the
device<00:05:47.000> that's<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.180> four<00:05:48.360> buttons<00:05:48.780> are<00:05:49.020> on<00:05:49.199> the

device that's it four buttons are on the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.930 
device that's it four buttons are on the
back<00:05:49.710> so<00:05:50.490> look<00:05:50.610> at<00:05:50.699> the<00:05:50.789> camera<00:05:52.789> it's<00:05:53.789> actually

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
a nice soft eye it looks a lot like the

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.540 
a nice soft eye it looks a lot like the
rigid<00:05:56.880> back<00:05:57.060> on<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.389> s2<00:05:57.900> but<00:05:58.440> it's<00:05:59.190> actually<00:05:59.340> a

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
rigid back on the s2 but it's actually a

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.449
