really enjoyed working out as a club
that<00:00:22.050> gave<00:00:22.350> me<00:00:22.529> my<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.430> opportunity<00:00:23.670> in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180

that<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> always<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.460> close<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> clock

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that and always be close to the clock

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
that and always be close to the clock
but<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.289> felt<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> wasn't<00:00:28.920> necessarily

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
but I just felt it wasn't necessarily

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.089 
but I just felt it wasn't necessarily
just<00:00:29.939> saturday<00:00:30.330> i<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:30.929> been<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
just saturday i think there's been a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.209 
just saturday i think there's been a
sequence<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> results<00:00:32.430> where<00:00:33.649> for<00:00:34.649> several

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
sequence of results where for several

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
sequence of results where for several
weeks<00:00:35.250> now<00:00:35.520> i<00:00:35.670> thought<00:00:36.090> i<00:00:36.120> could<00:00:36.450> improve

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
weeks now i thought i could improve

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.049 
weeks now i thought i could improve
things<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.320> thought<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:37.890> man<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
things I thought was the right man to to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
things I thought was the right man to to
get<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> results<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> hasn't

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
get the results going and it hasn't

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.209 
get the results going and it hasn't
materialized<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> felt<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
materialized so I felt that there was a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
materialized so I felt that there was a
need<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> decision<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.450> made<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.960> don't

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
need for a decision to be made I don't

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
need for a decision to be made I don't
think<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.440> could<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.739> carry<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.090> same

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
think we could just carry on in the same

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.830 
think we could just carry on in the same
vein<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:49.860> decision<00:00:50.370> reach<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.600> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
vein and that decision reach was that I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.729 
vein and that decision reach was that I
would<00:00:52.320> step<00:00:52.649> down<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:54.170> team<00:00:55.170> manager<00:00:55.289> shows

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
would step down as as team manager shows

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.770 
would step down as as team manager shows
b-town<00:00:56.120> right<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> last<00:00:57.539> few<00:00:57.719> weeks

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
b-town right over the last few weeks

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.080 
b-town right over the last few weeks
there's<00:00:58.410> been<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.590> team<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.430> getting

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
there's been a team going out getting

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
there's been a team going out getting
resort<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> old<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.109> putting<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.530> good

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
resort to old and putting in good

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
resort to old and putting in good
performances<00:01:02.190> MK<00:01:02.579> Dons<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
performances MK Dons so it's a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
performances MK Dons so it's a
frustration<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.489> come

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
frustration that it's just not come

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.050 
frustration that it's just not come
together<00:01:06.080> yeah<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> manager

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
together yeah I think that as a manager

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
together yeah I think that as a manager
you<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.390> responsibility<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.100> think

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
you take responsibility for that I think

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
you take responsibility for that I think
that<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.360> two<00:01:12.390> things<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:13.049> improve<00:01:13.470> we've

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that one or two things can improve we've

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
that one or two things can improve we've
got<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.790> players<00:01:15.000> coming<00:01:15.270> back<00:01:15.479> from

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
got one or two players coming back from

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
got one or two players coming back from
injury<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> Luke<00:01:16.350> Summerfield<00:01:16.650> Adam<00:01:17.189> will

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
injury and Luke Summerfield Adam will

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039

in<00:01:19.170> training<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.530> morning<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
in training this morning so all that

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.080 
in training this morning so all that
will<00:01:21.270> help<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> cause<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.369> feel<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
will help the cause but I just feel that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.410 
will help the cause but I just feel that
sometimes<00:01:24.720> there's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> fresh<00:01:26.189> voice<00:01:26.640> needed

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
sometimes there's a fresh voice needed

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.109 
sometimes there's a fresh voice needed
at<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> helm<00:01:28.280> fresh<00:01:29.280> voice<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> dressing

at the helm fresh voice in the dressing
room<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> time<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.530> do

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
room and I think the time is right to do

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
room and I think the time is right to do
that<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.700> club<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:37.640> think<00:01:38.640> I'd<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that at this club I think I'd got the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.050 
that at this club I think I'd got the
belief<00:01:40.890> from<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> chairman<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> could

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
belief from the chairman that I could

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.510 
belief from the chairman that I could
turn<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> around<00:01:42.920> don't<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.310> any

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
turn it around don't think there was any

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.899 
turn it around don't think there was any
thoughts<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.689> him<00:01:46.189> asking<00:01:47.189> me<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.399> resign<00:01:47.520> or

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
thoughts of him asking me to resign or

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.480 
thoughts of him asking me to resign or
anything<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:49.110> fact<00:01:49.170> he's<00:01:49.979> done

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
anything like that in fact he's done

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.039 
anything like that in fact he's done
nothing<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.420> knee<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
nothing but back knee all the way I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.080 
nothing but back knee all the way I
think<00:01:52.380> he<00:01:52.829> doesn't<00:01:53.159> always<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.640> press

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
think he doesn't always get good press

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
think he doesn't always get good press
with<00:01:54.299> supporters<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.200> I've<00:01:55.350> got<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> say<00:01:55.829> he's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
with supporters but I've got to say he's

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
with supporters but I've got to say he's
a<00:01:56.040> good<00:01:56.189> chair<00:01:56.399> me<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> work<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.840> anything

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
a good chair me to work for anything

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
players that have been available there

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.539 
players that have been available there
would<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:03.990> been<00:02:04.079> forms<00:02:04.469> available<00:02:04.710> I've<00:02:05.130> no

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
would have been forms available I've no

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.520 
would have been forms available I've no
doubt<00:02:05.759> about<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.079> fact<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.380> we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
doubt about that so the fact that we

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.499 
doubt about that so the fact that we
haven't<00:02:07.740> been<00:02:08.099> able<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.640> sign<00:02:08.849> players<00:02:09.060> over

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
haven't been able to sign players over

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.800 
haven't been able to sign players over
the<00:02:09.569> last

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
the last

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.930 
the last
month<00:02:11.140> or<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:11.470> when<00:02:11.770> they<00:02:11.890> were<00:02:12.190> badly<00:02:12.400> needed

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
month or so when they were badly needed

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940 
month or so when they were badly needed
I<00:02:13.090> don't<00:02:13.750> think<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.140> any<00:02:14.260> way<00:02:14.500> shape<00:02:14.530> or<00:02:14.890> form

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
I don't think in any way shape or form

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.790 
I don't think in any way shape or form
it<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.430> down<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.670> any<00:02:16.290> reticent<00:02:17.290> attitude

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
it was down to any reticent attitude

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.740 
it was down to any reticent attitude
from<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.160> Chairman<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.880> provide<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.330> finance

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
from the Chairman to provide the finance

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.750 
from the Chairman to provide the finance
I<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:20.620> he<00:02:20.770> has<00:02:20.860> backed<00:02:21.160> me<00:02:21.310> one<00:02:21.459> hundred

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
I think he has backed me one hundred

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.140 
I think he has backed me one hundred
percent<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.239> that's<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> reasons

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
percent and that's one of the reasons

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.059 
percent and that's one of the reasons
that's<00:02:25.150> led<00:02:25.330> me<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.750> decision<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.739> I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
that's led me to the decision you know I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.490 
that's led me to the decision you know I
feel<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:28.630> should<00:02:28.660> be<00:02:28.930> doing<00:02:29.050> better<00:02:29.349> than

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
feel that we should be doing better than

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.620 
feel that we should be doing better than
we<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.980> perhaps<00:02:30.970> somebody<00:02:31.239> else<00:02:31.480> can

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
we are and perhaps somebody else can

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.809 
we are and perhaps somebody else can
take<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> forward<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.349> because<00:02:33.280> whoever<00:02:33.370> gets

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
take it forward now because whoever gets

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.479 
take it forward now because whoever gets
in<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.450> team<00:02:34.870> which<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.170> not<00:02:35.349> bad

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
in there it's a team which is not bad

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.850 
in there it's a team which is not bad
position<00:02:36.489> wise<00:02:36.700> there<00:02:37.090> are<00:02:37.239> 16<00:02:37.900> s<00:02:38.019> Bulow's<00:02:38.290> 19

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
position wise there are 16 s Bulow's 19

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.820 
position wise there are 16 s Bulow's 19
teams<00:02:39.130> 19<00:02:39.940> games<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.300> go<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:41.680> that's

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
teams 19 games to go I think that's

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.530 
teams 19 games to go I think that's
right<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.370> say<00:02:42.610> with<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.910> recovery<00:02:43.180> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
right and as I say with the recovery and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.539 
right and as I say with the recovery and
maybe<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:44.019> or<00:02:44.110> two<00:02:44.140> players<00:02:44.440> coming<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
maybe one or two players coming in I

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.550 
maybe one or two players coming in I
think<00:02:46.299> I've<00:02:46.420> been<00:02:46.600> unlucky<00:02:46.989> with<00:02:47.319> one<00:02:47.440> or<00:02:47.530> two

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
think I've been unlucky with one or two

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.520 
think I've been unlucky with one or two
players<00:02:47.890> recently<00:02:49.019> we've<00:02:50.019> actually<00:02:50.170> got<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
players recently we've actually got a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.449 
players recently we've actually got a

contract type on the computer ready and

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.839 
contract type on the computer ready and
I<00:02:54.519> thought<00:02:54.730> we'd<00:02:54.910> get<00:02:55.030> him<00:02:55.180> last<00:02:55.900> Wednesday<00:02:56.849> he

I thought we'd get him last Wednesday he

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.460 
I thought we'd get him last Wednesday he
didn't<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.330> last<00:02:58.510> minute<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.959> was<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.170> change

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
do think six or seven and eight weeks

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.199

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
think the side the makeup of the side is

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.990 
think the side the makeup of the side is
reasonable<00:04:08.079> i<00:04:08.260> think<00:04:09.069> at<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.370> moment<00:04:09.400> they

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
reasonable i think at the moment they

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.300 
reasonable i think at the moment they
are<00:04:10.030> massively<00:04:10.870> short<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.380> confidence<00:04:11.889> and

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
are massively short of confidence and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.190 
are massively short of confidence and
you<00:04:12.639> can<00:04:12.790> understand<00:04:13.269> that<00:04:13.329> from<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.690> run<00:04:14.049> of

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
you can understand that from the run of

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.409 
you can understand that from the run of
foam<00:04:14.470> results<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.040> we've<00:04:15.160> had<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.060> was

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.940 
clearly in evidence on Saturday you know
people<00:04:19.269> start<00:04:19.659> questioning<00:04:20.200> passion<00:04:20.709> and

there's no r if there's nothing on to
wall<00:04:42.879> between<00:04:43.150> myself<00:04:43.449> and<00:04:43.719> the<00:04:43.810> players<00:04:44.080> I

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
wall between myself and the players I

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.080 
wall between myself and the players I
think<00:04:44.680> they<00:04:44.830> have<00:04:44.860> worked<00:04:45.189> as<00:04:45.460> hard<00:04:45.729> as<00:04:45.969> they

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
think they have worked as hard as they

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.480 
think they have worked as hard as they
could<00:04:46.150> have<00:04:46.360> done<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:48.039> say<00:04:48.189> I<00:04:48.219> think

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
could have done and as I say I think

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.510 
could have done and as I say I think
they're<00:04:48.849> just<00:04:49.060> very<00:04:49.689> short<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.229> confidence

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
they're just very short on confidence

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.890 
they're just very short on confidence
there's<00:04:51.520> your<00:04:51.759> early<00:04:52.210> season<00:04:52.599> in<00:04:52.719> some

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
there's your early season in some

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.689 
there's your early season in some
outstanding<00:04:53.169> performances<00:04:54.099> that<00:04:54.370> they<00:04:54.520> can

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
outstanding performances that they can

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.700 
outstanding performances that they can
play<00:04:54.849> the<00:04:55.029> game<00:04:55.180> we've<00:04:56.020> tried<00:04:56.259> to<00:04:56.349> play<00:04:56.529> in<00:04:56.590> a

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
play the game we've tried to play in a

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.439 
play the game we've tried to play in a
pleasing<00:04:56.949> manner<00:04:57.370> which<00:04:57.610> puts<00:04:58.210> more<00:04:58.389> pressure

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
pleasing manner which puts more pressure

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.330 
pleasing manner which puts more pressure
on<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.990> player<00:04:59.169> on<00:04:59.379> players<00:04:59.680> when<00:04:59.979> they<00:05:00.009> are

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
on the player on players when they are

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.670 
on the player on players when they are
short<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.699> confidence<00:05:01.259> so<00:05:02.259> all<00:05:02.439> those<00:05:02.620> things

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
short of confidence so all those things

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.490 
short of confidence so all those things
have<00:05:03.250> contributed<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.569> where<00:05:05.229> we<00:05:05.319> find

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
have contributed to where we find

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.499 
have contributed to where we find
ourselves<00:05:05.710> but<00:05:06.279> that<00:05:06.759> can<00:05:06.939> change<00:05:06.969> I'm<00:05:07.389> sure

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
ourselves but that can change I'm sure

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.269 
ourselves but that can change I'm sure
of<00:05:07.719> that<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.259> I<00:05:08.439> think<00:05:08.680> there's<00:05:08.830> enough<00:05:09.039> games

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 
of that and I think there's enough games

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.670 
of that and I think there's enough games
left<00:05:09.580> there<00:05:10.419> are<00:05:10.659> enough<00:05:10.990> good<00:05:11.199> players<00:05:11.319> in

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
we've you know the disappointment of

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.019 
we've you know the disappointment of
losing<00:05:38.050> in<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.649> playoffs<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:42.029> achievement

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
losing in the playoffs the achievement

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.279 
losing in the playoffs the achievement
of<00:05:43.089> winning<00:05:43.719> promotion<00:05:44.219> terrific<00:05:45.219> days<00:05:45.729> and

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
of winning promotion terrific days and

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.439 
of winning promotion terrific days and
more<00:05:47.289> recently<00:05:47.319> I<00:05:47.770> think<00:05:48.159> the<00:05:48.279> stay<00:05:48.909> behind<00:05:49.120> us

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
more recently I think the stay behind us

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.839 
more recently I think the stay behind us
and<00:05:49.899> I<00:05:50.379> think<00:05:51.189> that<00:05:51.339> was<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.460> case<00:05:51.639> on

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
and I think that was the case on

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.339 
and I think that was the case on
Saturday<00:05:52.240> despite<00:05:52.629> the<00:05:52.750> fact<00:05:52.930> we<00:05:53.110> were<00:05:53.169> three

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
Saturday despite the fact we were three

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.889 
Saturday despite the fact we were three
nailed<00:05:53.560> down<00:05:54.000> certainly<00:05:55.000> for<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.210> first<00:05:55.449> 20

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
nailed down certainly for the first 20

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:58.110 
nailed down certainly for the first 20
minutes<00:05:55.930> 20<00:05:56.349> half<00:05:56.770> an<00:05:56.919> hour<00:05:57.039> of<00:05:57.219> the<00:05:57.370> second

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
minutes 20 half an hour of the second

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.149 
minutes 20 half an hour of the second
half<00:05:58.240> on<00:05:58.419> Saturday<00:05:58.479> they<00:05:59.199> got<00:05:59.770> behind<00:05:59.919> the

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
half on Saturday they got behind the

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.249 
half on Saturday they got behind the
players<00:06:00.370> I<00:06:00.639> think<00:06:01.149> there's<00:06:01.629> obviously<00:06:01.960> some

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
players I think there's obviously some

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.619 
players I think there's obviously some
dissenting<00:06:03.009> voices<00:06:03.219> and<00:06:03.639> booze<00:06:04.120> at<00:06:04.389> the<00:06:04.479> end

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
dissenting voices and booze at the end

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.659 
dissenting voices and booze at the end
which<00:06:04.930> is<00:06:05.199> understandable<00:06:05.919> when<00:06:06.460> you've<00:06:06.580> lost

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
which is understandable when you've lost

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.019 
which is understandable when you've lost
six<00:06:07.000> at<00:06:07.120> home<00:06:07.210> on<00:06:07.419> the<00:06:07.509> trot<00:06:07.949> but<00:06:08.949> generally<00:06:09.189> I

that people get used to going the same

look to the future have a little think
about<00:07:13.930> what<00:07:14.230> you're<00:07:14.350> going<00:07:14.470> to<00:07:14.530> do<00:07:14.680> and<00:07:14.920> no

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
about what you're going to do and no

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.620 
about what you're going to do and no
quick<00:07:16.840> decisions<00:07:17.520> I've<00:07:18.520> got<00:07:19.150> to<00:07:19.240> be<00:07:19.300> honest

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
quick decisions I've got to be honest

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.920 
quick decisions I've got to be honest
you<00:07:19.870> sit<00:07:20.170> and<00:07:20.260> contemplate<00:07:20.500> the<00:07:21.100> future<00:07:21.310> and<00:07:21.930> i

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
you sit and contemplate the future and i

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.050 
you sit and contemplate the future and i
would<00:07:23.830> think<00:07:24.040> it'd<00:07:24.190> be<00:07:24.220> fair<00:07:24.460> to<00:07:24.520> say<00:07:24.790> that<00:07:24.820> my

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
would think it'd be fair to say that my

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.190 
would think it'd be fair to say that my
managerial<00:07:25.690> days<00:07:26.080> are<00:07:26.290> over<00:07:27.660> but<00:07:28.660> aside<00:07:29.020> of

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.200 
managerial days are over but aside of

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.690 
managerial days are over but aside of
that<00:07:29.380> you<00:07:29.680> know<00:07:29.830> there<00:07:30.040> might<00:07:30.130> be<00:07:30.190> something<00:07:30.490> I

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700 
that you know there might be something I

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.170 
that you know there might be something I
can<00:07:30.760> contribute<00:07:31.090> somewhere<00:07:32.820> maybe<00:07:33.820> a<00:07:33.970> door

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180 
can contribute somewhere maybe a door

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.030 
can contribute somewhere maybe a door
open<00:07:34.480> to<00:07:34.510> come<00:07:34.720> back<00:07:34.930> at<00:07:35.080> some<00:07:35.260> time<00:07:35.530> in<00:07:35.560> the

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.040 
open to come back at some time in the

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.620 
open to come back at some time in the
long<00:07:36.190> term<00:07:36.460> future<00:07:36.730> yeah<00:07:37.950> but<00:07:38.950> I<00:07:39.070> go<00:07:39.310> away

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:39.630 
long term future yeah but I go away

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.990 
long term future yeah but I go away
purely<00:07:40.630> with<00:07:41.260> the<00:07:41.410> view<00:07:41.650> that<00:07:41.680> my<00:07:42.610> time<00:07:42.790> is<00:07:42.850> up

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 
purely with the view that my time is up

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.670 
purely with the view that my time is up
here<00:07:43.300> I<00:07:43.480> think<00:07:43.810> it's<00:07:43.930> the<00:07:44.020> right<00:07:44.170> time<00:07:44.410> to<00:07:44.590> do

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
here I think it's the right time to do

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.500 
here I think it's the right time to do
it<00:07:44.710> I<00:07:44.950> think<00:07:45.670> there's<00:07:45.790> only<00:07:45.850> one<00:07:46.120> thing<00:07:46.330> in

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.510 
it I think there's only one thing in

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.970 
it I think there's only one thing in
Port<00:07:46.720> if<00:07:46.870> that's<00:07:47.050> important<00:07:47.590> than<00:07:47.800> that<00:07:47.920> is

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:47.980 
Port if that's important than that is

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.670 
Port if that's important than that is
the<00:07:48.220> football<00:07:48.580> club<00:07:48.670> itself<00:07:49.060> and<00:07:49.680> ensuring

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 
the football club itself and ensuring

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.580 
the football club itself and ensuring
safety<00:07:50.950> so<00:07:51.400> it's<00:07:52.210> perhaps<00:07:52.630> taking<00:07:52.960> stock<00:07:53.350> over

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.590 
safety so it's perhaps taking stock over

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.080 
safety so it's perhaps taking stock over
the<00:07:53.680> next<00:07:53.890> couple<00:07:54.040> of<00:07:54.190> weeks<00:07:54.370> and<00:07:54.580> deciding

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
the next couple of weeks and deciding

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.240 
the next couple of weeks and deciding
where<00:07:55.300> we<00:07:55.450> go<00:07:55.570> from<00:07:55.600> here<00:07:55.810> sir<00:07:56.350> as<00:07:56.590> a<00:07:56.980> family

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250 
where we go from here sir as a family

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.630 
where we go from here sir as a family
man<00:07:57.550> but<00:07:57.940> I<00:07:58.890> think<00:07:59.890> it<00:08:00.040> would<00:08:00.190> be<00:08:00.310> fair<00:08:00.460> to<00:08:00.520> say

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:00.640 
man but I think it would be fair to say

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.580 
man but I think it would be fair to say
I<00:08:00.790> can't<00:08:01.210> see<00:08:01.480> myself<00:08:01.660> in<00:08:02.020> another<00:08:02.080> managerial

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:02.590 
I can't see myself in another managerial

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:10.330 
I can't see myself in another managerial
role

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:10.340 

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.890 

you

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:14.900 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.960
