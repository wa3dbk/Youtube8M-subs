00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.819
 I got stuck 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 Y 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.480
 we are going 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.280
 today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.460
 back a mobile 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.640
 this owes to the causes of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.050
 where I was was a mist misses in 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.030
 I 've taught them the email 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.340
 previously as backing the folder 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.860
 of fs but sometimes we support the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.440
 folder and they do not give them email then I've 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.620
 got another method to be able 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.390
 recover what is this the moment the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.300
 email so I have this 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.489
 coverages we install the 2 coal or the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 aurora in the version of 94 so there's 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.739
 several people who have lost what is the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.970
 e-mail 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.330
 so here I am going right now 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.280
 teach this how you can take out the mobile 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.130
 from the official album that we got from sant 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.149
 we installed the mobile or removing it 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.710
 the lollipop that is students of this the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.050
 good coverage we all have to always 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.810
 save that room whether it's the remove or the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.280
 of lollipop today I have here the removes 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 this same life or what it was 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 what was the email that I have to 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.990
 supports what we are going to do to get 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.990
 the monk is to delete where he says md5 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.480
 we are going to erase it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.970
 here deleted we give this in accept 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.090
 here he tells me that if we want to do the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.590
 changes we put that if it's going to 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.130
 transform into a chip 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.789
 you can see 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.789
 here we go this April 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.689
 and we will take the time 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.200
 what would it be that he's checking here 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.530
 so you can see well that they can 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.090
 see this well we are going to take it out that it would be 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.830
 that we have to plant equally for 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.390
 dyn this will explain how 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.430
 raise it then this one 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.430
 we are going to observe here what we are going to try 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.880
 there we take it out you can see 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.610
 let's open what is the login 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.400
 we're going to give you good here we mark 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.980
 nothing 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.510
 to someone's place in ap let's go 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.510
 to give in p 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.550
 and we pique there we go to the desk of 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.200
 we have passed it what is the modem 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.260
 the mountain has to be this point well 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.420
 here we give this 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.879
 this does not last long loading 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.720
 our terminal in download mode to mode 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.709
 of lohan and we postpone it with the light that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.459
 you have to have no coverage 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.659
 if you speak or start or the aurora or some 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.000
 another rom that you are failing 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.579
 what is the email and easily 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.980
 recover the email the signal and everything 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.489
 works fine I make this little video 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.560
 because I do not have friends yet 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.150
 we help then better returned by 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.849
 any case they do more this 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.349
 people who have this problem have 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.640
 the phone over there already thrown away because 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.079
 they believe that they will not be able to recover 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.389
 email or something 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.940
 then how do I tell them if they download the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.129
 official moon of click wardle and the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.859
 sun mobile equal of good by chaos given 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.200
 case this happens or the lollipop that 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.879
 gave him a signal and how he makes browne and 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.770
 that hangs on the email and you do what 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.280
 same and take the email from there 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.380
 what would the modem be and they pass it here and 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.630
 they are unloaded who will charge 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.550
 You must start and you already have a telephone 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.140
 arranged hopefully liked this 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.090
 small video that I have made for 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.880
 you friends this is for the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.110
 terminals this s 4 more than all and 9,500 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.049

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.050
 of that 4 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.669

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.509
 Do not think you have lost the email and 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.330
 that they no longer have the phone this way 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.819
