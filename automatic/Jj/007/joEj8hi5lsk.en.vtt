00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.220
 Good girls, I confess that 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.160
 lately I'm just using the 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.139
 bar lipstick for everything so much 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.900
 that I have forgotten that there are 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.299
 lip glosses so I've decided 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.699
 give me the task of seeing in what else we 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.260
 can be useful and turn them into the 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 center of attention so that it does not 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.840
 feel so alone 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.780
 Okay, let's see 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.460
 ok we start if after fixing you 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.860
 the eyebrows want you to look more 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.870
 polished and natural you can apply a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.000
 little of the lip gloss directly on 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.980
 eyebrows or if you want to control the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.470
 amount applies a little behind the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.449
 hand you take a little with the brush to 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.820
 eyebrows and you comb them as always 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.559
 you do this this will also give the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.629
 eyebrows a fresher look and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.390
 will help keep them in place 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.020
 a little more perfect 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.399
 to these shades that are even more vibrant 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.500
 with a little of your concealer of dark circles 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.809
 mixed with the lip gloss and what 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 Apply on the eyelid preferably 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.340
 on top of your pre eye cup for 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.140
 avoid folds the stickiness of brightness 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.970
 lipstick will make the shadows adhere 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.119
 and concentrate more by making them more 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.979
 intense but remember to just use a little 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.790
 of the lip gloss because otherwise it will 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.380
 the shadows run in seconds 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.710
 perfect now we apply the shadow on x 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 ramis 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.360
 you wear the black eyeliner and you do not have 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.520
 other color 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 No problem applies lip gloss 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.110
 behind the hand looks for the color of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.910
 shadow you want with the brush with a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.050
 little lip gloss and shadow 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.970
 always remember to remove the excess 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.270
 and tea lines your eyes like 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270
 habit 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:10.270
 you already have an eyeliner 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.270
 original now yes to complete the eyes 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.099
 low lists 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.400
 so we can use it more in the 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.400
 cheeks 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.290
 first option after applying your 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.540
 normal flush again apply shine 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.400
 lipstick behind the hand is better 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.860
 because you better control the amount that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.110
 you use a little with your fingers and 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.400
 applied to little touches on top of the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.400
 cheeks as an illuminator 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.840
 never drag them over the dust 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.390
 because if you do not run 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.280
 we can also take advantage of it and use it as 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.269
 illuminator in the rest of the face as 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.269
 in the bone of the eyebrow 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.240
 and also on the bridge of the nose to 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.930
 that wet appearance but without 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.930
 see greasy 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.120
 the second option is to catch your brightness 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.280
 lipstick with color and use it as a blush 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.319
 applying small amounts in the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.280
 cheeks and with the fingers we blur it 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.280
 a little 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.260
 if you feel the sticky lip gloss 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.870
 Apply it behind the hand and next to a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.760
 Labial without color mixes both 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.879
 products and you apply it to it 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.900
 way to taps also this will help 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.900
 to soften the color 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.560
 perfect for a luminous appearance and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.560
 healthy I said different blushes 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.030
 and finally you can search it only in 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.180
 the lips like what are glitters 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.180
 lipstick 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.670
 or on top of a bar lipstick 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.560
 highlight the lips even more is about 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 do it as usual to pat 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.630
 that the lipstick does not run 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.200
 ok to keep the lipstick clean the 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.750
 brush and since we solved a lot 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.110
 but we have another function and this time 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.660
 It's in the hair if you have the tips 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.700
 open or you want to control it applies a 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.829
 little lip gloss on the fingers then 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.810
 rub them if you apply them on the tips 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.389
 to soften them and be able to handle it better 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.330
 this will also give an additional brightness 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.400
 perfect if you have dry hair 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.129
 wow that much profit we can take 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.629
 to a simple lip gloss true what 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.550
 important is to use the small 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.960
 amounts so you do not feel stick 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.090
 they are uncomfortable 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.349
 ok i promise to make you more good case girls 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.939
 this was all I hope you have 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.250
 enjoyed that I have given you some idea 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.990
 these perfect if they have dry skin and 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.430
 If you have oily skin and even more if 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.069
 you want to try something do it 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.659
 carefully and I did it all together 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.550
 true for the purpose of the video but 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.139
 you do it as you wish and 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.819
 but there's another way that I'm going to 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.219
 make my candle in a makeup so that 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.289
 you see how it looks in makeup 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.699
 complete and therefore nothing to remember that as 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.139
 always all the produce will be 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.879
 down in the information box of 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.159
 video just like all networks 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.240
 social and then nothing now a kiss and 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.240
 see you in the next
