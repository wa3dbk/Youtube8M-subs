00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
is no waste articulation you don't

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.280 
is no waste articulation you don't
really<00:04:32.850> need<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.330> i<00:04:33.450> don't<00:04:33.630> think<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:33.900> i<00:04:34.110> don't

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
really need it i don't think so i don't

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.020 
really need it i don't think so i don't
really<00:04:34.440> feel<00:04:34.800> like<00:04:34.830> that's<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.310> negative<00:04:35.730> about

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
really feel like that's a negative about

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.740 
really feel like that's a negative about
this<00:04:36.240> figure<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.680> do<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.550> belt<00:04:39.390> here

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
this figure you do have the belt here

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.220 
this figure you do have the belt here
which<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.700> as<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:42.030> can<00:04:42.060> see<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.390> separate<00:04:43.080> piece

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
which is as you can see a separate piece

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.250 
which is as you can see a separate piece
of<00:04:43.380> plastic<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.100> think<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.180> glued<00:04:45.540> in<00:04:45.780> behind

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
of plastic I think it's glued in behind

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.110 
of plastic I think it's glued in behind
the<00:04:46.530> x-men<00:04:47.600> logo<00:04:48.600> here<00:04:48.810> or<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.140> x-force<00:04:49.530> logo

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
the x-men logo here or the x-force logo

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.750 
the x-men logo here or the x-force logo
now<00:04:51.120> coming<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.260> issue<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.770> have<00:04:53.040> with<00:04:53.070> the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
now coming to the issue I have with the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.170 
now coming to the issue I have with the
hips<00:04:54.680> there<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.460> know<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.610> joint<00:04:56.970> there

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
hips there is you know a joint there

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.810 
hips there is you know a joint there
obviously<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.440> range<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:59.130> articulation

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
obviously but the range of articulation

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.690 
obviously but the range of articulation
is<00:05:00.000> not<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.510> great<00:05:00.870> for<00:05:01.620> example<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.310> would

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
is not that great for example you would

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.510 
is not that great for example you would
think<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.750> would<00:05:03.840> think<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.170> a<00:05:04.520> figure

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
think that you would think that a figure

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.220 
think that you would think that a figure
or<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> character<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.510> this<00:05:06.630> nature<00:05:06.840> would<00:05:06.960> be

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
or a character of this nature would be

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.280 
or a character of this nature would be
able<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.500> do<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.740> splits<00:05:08.040> well<00:05:08.880> on<00:05:09.780> this

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
able to do the splits well on this

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.280 
able to do the splits well on this
figure<00:05:10.620> you<00:05:10.830> really<00:05:11.190> can't<00:05:11.400> do<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:12.200> one<00:05:13.200> of

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
figure you really can't do that one of

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.110 
figure you really can't do that one of
two<00:05:13.410> things<00:05:13.440> is<00:05:13.800> going<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.010> happen

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
two things is going to happen

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.730 
two things is going to happen
something's<00:05:15.120> going<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.300> break<00:05:15.360> or<00:05:15.960> it's<00:05:16.650> going

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
something's going to break or it's going

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.690 
something's going to break or it's going
to<00:05:16.830> pop<00:05:17.010> off<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.580> ball<00:05:18.030> joint<00:05:18.330> so

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
to pop off the ball joint so

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.500 
to pop off the ball joint so
unfortunately<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:20.850> can't<00:05:21.090> really<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.390> the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
unfortunately you can't really do the

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.160 
unfortunately you can't really do the
splits<00:05:21.780> with<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.230> figure<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:24.690> can<00:05:24.870> move<00:05:24.990> the

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
splits with this figure you can move the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.370 
splits with this figure you can move the
legs<00:05:25.380> somewhat<00:05:25.980> forward<00:05:26.570> as<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:27.870> can<00:05:28.020> see<00:05:28.230> it

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
legs somewhat forward as you can see it

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.910 
legs somewhat forward as you can see it
clashes<00:05:28.740> with<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:30.110> piece<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.260> plastic<00:05:31.650> right

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
clashes with this piece of plastic right

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.850 
clashes with this piece of plastic right
here<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.640> then<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.870> really<00:05:34.050> can't<00:05:34.440> go<00:05:34.590> back

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
here and then you really can't go back

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.810 
here and then you really can't go back
at<00:05:35.160> all<00:05:35.250> because<00:05:35.550> her<00:05:35.970> but<00:05:36.300> plastic<00:05:36.870> is

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
at all because her but plastic is

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.850 
at all because her but plastic is
blocking<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:39.120> movement<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.260> back<00:05:40.440> for

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
blocking the movement to the back for

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.370 
blocking the movement to the back for
the<00:05:40.950> leg<00:05:41.480> but<00:05:42.480> moving<00:05:42.780> on<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:43.080> do<00:05:43.170> have<00:05:43.350> a

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
the leg but moving on you do have a

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.550 
the leg but moving on you do have a
swivel<00:05:43.860> at<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.100> thigh<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.760> a<00:05:45.180> nice<00:05:45.560> double

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
swivel at the thigh and a nice double

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.140 
swivel at the thigh and a nice double
jointed<00:05:47.010> knee<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:48.660> very<00:05:48.870> nicely<00:05:49.110> placed

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
jointed knee and a very nicely placed

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.000 
jointed knee and a very nicely placed
swivel<00:05:51.150> joint<00:05:51.450> here<00:05:51.720> at<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.170> top<00:05:52.380> of<00:05:52.410> her<00:05:52.800> boot

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
swivel joint here at the top of her boot

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.450 
swivel joint here at the top of her boot
again<00:05:53.400> I<00:05:53.640> like<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.120> details<00:05:54.510> with<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.460> straps

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
again I like the details with the straps

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.240 
again I like the details with the straps
and<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:56.790> buckle<00:05:57.120> they're<00:05:57.300> very<00:05:57.540> nice<00:05:57.780> and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
and the buckle they're very nice and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.710 
and the buckle they're very nice and
looking<00:05:59.250> at<00:05:59.430> her<00:05:59.640> ankle<00:06:00.030> now<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.300> ankle

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
looking at her ankle now the ankle

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.050 
looking at her ankle now the ankle
articulation<00:06:00.840> is<00:06:01.350> pretty<00:06:01.590> nice<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:02.550> really

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
articulation is pretty nice it really

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.750 
articulation is pretty nice it really
see<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.960> can<00:06:07.110> rotate<00:06:07.290> around<00:06:07.590> but<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.610> way

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
see it can rotate around but the way

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.540 
see it can rotate around but the way
that<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.270> joint<00:06:09.600> is<00:06:09.780> set<00:06:10.020> up<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:10.410> can<00:06:11.160> see<00:06:11.370> it

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
that the joint is set up you can see it

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.700 
that the joint is set up you can see it
has<00:06:11.730> like<00:06:12.440> sort<00:06:13.440> of<00:06:13.500> side-to-side<00:06:13.860> pivot<00:06:15.710> it's

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
has like sort of side-to-side pivot it's

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.270 
has like sort of side-to-side pivot it's
a<00:06:16.770> weird<00:06:17.150> type<00:06:18.150> of<00:06:18.360> ankle<00:06:18.630> joint<00:06:19.100> of<00:06:20.100> course

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
a weird type of ankle joint of course

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.430 
a weird type of ankle joint of course
you<00:06:20.400> can<00:06:20.490> go<00:06:20.610> back<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.360> forward<00:06:21.900> like<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.260> as

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
you can go back and forward like that as

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.890 
you can go back and forward like that as
you<00:06:22.530> can<00:06:22.590> see<00:06:22.830> there<00:06:23.330> but<00:06:24.330> you<00:06:24.390> do<00:06:24.540> sort<00:06:24.840> of

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
you can see there but you do sort of

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.990 
you can see there but you do sort of
have<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.080> pivot<00:06:25.710> if<00:06:26.130> you<00:06:26.250> can<00:06:26.370> see<00:06:26.550> right<00:06:26.580> there

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
have a pivot if you can see right there

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.340 
have a pivot if you can see right there
it<00:06:27.900> kind<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.170> pivots<00:06:28.470> around<00:06:28.530> the<00:06:28.890> ball<00:06:29.460> joint

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
it kind of pivots around the ball joint

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.020 
it kind of pivots around the ball joint
so<00:06:31.350> nice<00:06:32.160> figure<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.850> one<00:06:34.340> issue<00:06:35.340> I<00:06:35.640> guess

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
so nice figure the one issue I guess

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.030 
so nice figure the one issue I guess
that<00:06:36.930> some<00:06:37.290> other

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
that some other

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.950 
that some other
years<00:06:38.190> have<00:06:38.490> pointed<00:06:38.910> out<00:06:39.060> is<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.600> if<00:06:39.840> you

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
years have pointed out is that if you

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.070 
years have pointed out is that if you
look<00:06:39.990> at<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:40.560> legs<00:06:40.860> in<00:06:41.220> the<00:06:41.940> way<00:06:42.150> that<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:42.810> leg

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
look at the legs in the way that the leg

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.390 
look at the legs in the way that the leg
is<00:06:43.910> quite<00:06:44.910> long<00:06:45.260> in<00:06:46.260> relation<00:06:46.770> to<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.130> rest<00:06:47.250> of

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
is quite long in relation to the rest of

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.010 
is quite long in relation to the rest of
the<00:06:47.490> body<00:06:47.670> it<00:06:48.000> seems<00:06:48.600> to<00:06:48.690> be<00:06:48.810> out<00:06:48.990> of

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
the body it seems to be out of

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.070 
the body it seems to be out of
proportion<00:06:49.590> and<00:06:50.270> you<00:06:51.270> know<00:06:51.360> i'm<00:06:51.690> always<00:06:51.870> a<00:06:51.990> fan

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
proportion and you know i'm always a fan

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.520 
proportion and you know i'm always a fan
of<00:06:52.430> long<00:06:53.430> legs<00:06:53.790> with<00:06:54.120> women<00:06:54.480> but<00:06:54.630> this<00:06:54.870> is<00:06:55.050> like

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
of long legs with women but this is like

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.520 
of long legs with women but this is like
over<00:06:55.740> the<00:06:55.920> top<00:06:55.950> long<00:06:56.490> so<00:06:57.180> the<00:06:57.510> basically<00:06:58.380> the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
over the top long so the basically the

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.220 
over the top long so the basically the
leg<00:06:58.890> is<00:06:59.270> you<00:07:00.270> know<00:07:00.390> in<00:07:00.630> proportion<00:07:01.080> to<00:07:01.110> the

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
leg is you know in proportion to the

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.860 
leg is you know in proportion to the
rest<00:07:01.260> of<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.500> body<00:07:01.650> is<00:07:01.860> rather<00:07:02.160> large<00:07:02.550> and<00:07:02.870> not

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
rest of the body is rather large and not

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.800 
rest of the body is rather large and not
too<00:07:04.050> big<00:07:04.260> of<00:07:04.290> a<00:07:04.440> deal<00:07:04.590> i<00:07:04.710> mean<00:07:04.980> i<00:07:05.360> think<00:07:06.360> the

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
too big of a deal i mean i think the

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.190 
too big of a deal i mean i think the
long<00:07:07.230> legs<00:07:07.620> suit<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.760> character<00:07:09.180> so<00:07:09.480> it

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
long legs suit the character so it

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.600 
long legs suit the character so it
doesn't<00:07:10.440> really<00:07:10.500> bother<00:07:10.680> me<00:07:10.980> it's<00:07:11.250> just

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
doesn't really bother me it's just

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.550 
doesn't really bother me it's just
something<00:07:11.910> to<00:07:12.090> note<00:07:12.330> it<00:07:12.600> may<00:07:13.110> or<00:07:13.410> may<00:07:13.530> not

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
something to note it may or may not

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.790 
something to note it may or may not
bother<00:07:13.950> you<00:07:14.070> i'm<00:07:14.580> not<00:07:14.700> sure<00:07:14.940> but<00:07:15.800> just

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
bother you i'm not sure but just

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.760 
bother you i'm not sure but just
something<00:07:16.950> to<00:07:17.100> point<00:07:17.310> out<00:07:18.350> all<00:07:19.350> right<00:07:19.530> well

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
something to point out all right well

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.030 
something to point out all right well
