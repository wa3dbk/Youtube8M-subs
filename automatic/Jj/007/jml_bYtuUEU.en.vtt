00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
available to their students when I think

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
available to their students when I think
about<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> means<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> students<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
about what this means to students I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.609

think it's an opportunity for them to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.680 
think it's an opportunity for them to
really<00:01:17.070> hone<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.759> on
