00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.580
 pillowcase all that is required to release something 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.450
 you use it all to 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.170
 learn to 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.450
 perfect sew for still give advice not 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.390
 hurry up the most important thing is to understand the cut and 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.739
 be very careful about processing 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.019
 products then do it neatly if you 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.750
 get used to the accuracy of the speed you have 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.220
 will appear 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.880
 imperceptibly that is, you will do 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:14.900
 neatly plus everything else quickly 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:18.359
 and to the work that girls are that 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.930
 how horrible it makes me convinced because 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:26.900
 what were my courses doing faster 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.400
 faster and here is the answer and here 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.250
 satisfaction of your work 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.880
 work will not try to get 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.450
 so that you have everything well and so everything 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.190
 Here these are they should be considered 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.860
 when cutting fabric 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.020
 that is, we and cricket are their sections 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.849
 acre izba 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.849
 clearly a pair of shifted lines that is already 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.509
 wide in order to subsequently us 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:04.639
 collect on 2 rezinochki wider rather 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:07.789
 on a line and collect it this line for 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.569
 order in the same way on 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:15.520
 sleeve 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:19.009

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:27.860
 here when with sewn together here 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:33.050

 the car is two rows and 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.310
 under the bottom still make one line if 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.099
