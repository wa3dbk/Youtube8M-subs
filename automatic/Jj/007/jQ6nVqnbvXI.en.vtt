00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 hey people came too short 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 I have a recipe wish for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.140
 you he is and that this susanne 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.779
 unfortunately, her account is now 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 deleted but I found the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 combination very interesting as you want 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.810
 you have to necessarily show and pay 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 what you want with noodles and with 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.610
 stage and applies the combination already 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.550
 himself told then he wanted from the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 fritz app tab first you need 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.010
 first a half onion and a 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.750
 a bit off and a relatively high 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 pot and the goals you can completely 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.140
 easy in relatively rough cubes 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.879
 cut and give the same time the pot 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.890
 then you need a carrot there 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:06.510
 first the end of april you can then 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.840
 cut in half and quarter and then 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:16.369
 also cut into small pieces and 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.369
 you can also half go the pear 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 and then carefully the housing 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.100
 edit out 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:32.220
 in week 4, the states are, depending on 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.939
 size 23 the onions too slow 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 to begin 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:41.430
 you can already be loaded 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.850
 once the new furniture to give with 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.850
 fry 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.759
 you can be full of her on the heart 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.009
 reduce heat by about half 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:02:00.020
 would could now also in small 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:04.549
 Cutting pieces can still need one 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.000
 you can get up to two cloves of garlic 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.489
 cut in half and cut into small pieces 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.220
 If you have both garlic you can 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.360
 but also quite small if you 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.879
 belong then also a two minutes 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.700
 hinted you can the garlic 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:28.400
 Add and briefly simmer for a short time 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.530
 then could it also be the desired 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.790
 to give children 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.849
 in workshops ever on the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.959
 then turn down the smallest level 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.840
 needs it after 100 milliliters 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:43.129
 Lemon juice that would be about juice of 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.739
 1 to 2 lemons depending on size then too 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:51.799
 Already 100 grams of sugar 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.510
 about half to one teaspoon 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:59.980
 salt a little bit of chili with the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.349
 I hope the hair merkel something pepper 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.599

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.980
 turmeric and all that now at 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:13.730
 very low heat about a question hour 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.410
 simmer and not at 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.269
 then you google it already finished 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.709
 You can hardly do it for about 30 minutes 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.139
 the hearth plate because first make out 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.900
 then I have a handful here 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:32.440
 Wise are about 40 grams 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.180
 the can you even with the head diameter 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.599
 roughly chop and then likewise 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.599
 in the pot 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.879
