break up but we don't want to get any

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.670 
break up but we don't want to get any
air<00:02:58.769> into<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.030> once<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:00.840> broken<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.500> then

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
air into it and once it's broken up then

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.619 
air into it and once it's broken up then
we're<00:03:01.829> going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> start<00:03:02.430> adding<00:03:02.819> some<00:03:02.849> sugars

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
we're going to start adding some sugars

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.170 
we're going to start adding some sugars
now<00:03:03.870> we're<00:03:04.079> going<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> add<00:03:04.609> 3/4<00:03:05.609> of<00:03:05.639> a<00:03:05.880> cup<00:03:05.910> of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
now we're going to add 3/4 of a cup of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.430 
now we're going to add 3/4 of a cup of
brown<00:03:06.630> sugar<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.819> 1/4<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.209> cup<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.690> white

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
sugar and again turn it on kind of a low

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.370 
sugar and again turn it on kind of a low
speed<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.639> what<00:03:15.269> we're<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.660> try<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.019> do

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
speed and what we're going to try to do

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.069 
speed and what we're going to try to do
is<00:03:16.709> get<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.160> butter<00:03:17.549> in<00:03:17.880> those<00:03:18.180> sugars<00:03:18.780> to

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
is get that butter in those sugars to

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.059 
is get that butter in those sugars to
make<00:03:19.230> almost<00:03:19.709> kind<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.819> wet<00:03:21.269> sand

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
make almost kind of like a wet sand

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.759 
make almost kind of like a wet sand
again<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.340> don't<00:03:23.579> want<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.510> be<00:03:24.690> fluffy<00:03:25.530> by

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
again we don't want this to be fluffy by

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.370 
again we don't want this to be fluffy by
any<00:03:26.040> means<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.389> dense<00:03:27.660> like<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.049> wet

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380

vanilla mixture and we're going to pour

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.280 
vanilla mixture and we're going to pour
that<00:03:35.190> into<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> mixer<00:03:36.060> notice<00:03:36.690> it's<00:03:36.900> going

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
that into the mixer notice it's going

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.069 
that into the mixer notice it's going
pretty<00:03:37.319> slow<00:03:38.190> again<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.329> don't<00:03:39.540> want<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.870> beat

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
pretty slow again we don't want to beat

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.009 
pretty slow again we don't want to beat
a<00:03:40.109> lot<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.590> air<00:03:40.980> into<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.730> once<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.690> see

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
a lot of air into it and once you see

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.319 
a lot of air into it and once you see
that<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.410> eggs<00:03:43.620> are<00:03:43.980> pretty<00:03:44.250> much<00:03:44.519> mixed<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
that the eggs are pretty much mixed in

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.479 
that the eggs are pretty much mixed in
then<00:03:45.930> we're<00:03:46.169> going<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.319> start<00:03:46.709> adding<00:03:47.250> our

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
then we're going to start adding our

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.940 
then we're going to start adding our
chocolate<00:03:48.230> now<00:03:49.230> once<00:03:49.530> you've<00:03:49.709> got<00:03:49.739> your

melted chocolate in it's just going to

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.979 
melted chocolate in it's just going to
take<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> minute<00:03:53.069> or<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.790> slow<00:03:54.299> speed<00:03:54.359> to

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
take a minute or so on a slow speed to

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.250 
take a minute or so on a slow speed to
get<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:55.849> incorporated<00:03:56.849> then<00:03:57.540> stop<00:03:57.989> the

start scooping the cookies out now you

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.600 
start scooping the cookies out now you
can<00:04:49.350> see<00:04:49.860> these<00:04:50.070> are<00:04:50.400> very<00:04:51.000> very<00:04:51.540> fudgy<00:04:52.350> and

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
can see these are very very fudgy and

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.600 
can see these are very very fudgy and
because<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.360> don't<00:04:55.050> um<00:04:55.500> pack<00:04:56.280> them

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
because of that I don't um pack them

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.690 
because of that I don't um pack them
together<00:04:56.940> too<00:04:57.660> tightly<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.920> normally<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.520> a

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
together too tightly so normally I do a

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.240 
together too tightly so normally I do a
dozen<00:05:00.210> cookies<00:05:00.420> on<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> sheet<00:05:01.260> for<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.740> cookie

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
dozen cookies on a sheet for this cookie

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.910 
dozen cookies on a sheet for this cookie

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
I end up doing only about eight to ten

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.610 
I end up doing only about eight to ten
but<00:05:05.820> once<00:05:06.060> I've<00:05:06.270> got<00:05:06.540> a<00:05:06.570> whole<00:05:06.870> cookie<00:05:07.320> sheet

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620

but once I've got a whole cookie sheet
I'm<00:05:07.860> filled<00:05:08.730> up<00:05:08.970> then<00:05:09.240> I'm<00:05:09.390> going<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.630> go<00:05:09.810> ahead

and put them into a preheated oven about
350<00:05:15.090> degrees<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:16.020> then<00:05:16.710> they<00:05:16.919> are<00:05:17.100> going<00:05:17.310> to

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
350 degrees and then they are going to

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.770 
350 degrees and then they are going to

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
now it's really important to not

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.330 
now it's really important to not
overcook<00:05:24.060> these<00:05:24.750> cookies<00:05:25.410> because<00:05:25.650> again<00:05:26.160> we
