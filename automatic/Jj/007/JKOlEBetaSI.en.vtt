00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.029
 hello hello how are you welcome to me 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.399
 new video tutorial I am the fall 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.559
 the founder of camps is max but already 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.750
 they know they can not say here it or well 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.650
 I present you a new series of videos 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.600
 tutorials about unique units the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.510
 unique units are those that are in the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.880
 castles and that every feeling has or 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.349
 it is a unique and special unit for 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.529
 they are unique 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.050
 and good in this video in principle 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.240
 deals with units that would be the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.670
 units that would beat these units 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.650
 specials but I will also talk so that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.970
 these units of the castle are good 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.190
 pierre and to begin 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.170
 I'll start talking about the core announced the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.750
 special unit of the Koreans are the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 turrets of war and these carts are 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.130
 nothing more and nothing less than as archers 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.410
 on horseback although some may think 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.390
 which is like a siege since it shoots 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.820
 arrows identical to those of the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.730
 heavy but hey let's scorpions 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.860
 test this war wagon 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.950
 even against the infantry we can see 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.140
 that a real wing makes shit but 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.400
 a champion makes him a little more front 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.070
 but a champion does less damage to the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.630
 cart therefore it would be appropriate to use 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.690
 the war wagons in large 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.729
 amounts against the shelf now 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.040
 we will prove how good are the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.710
 war carts against units of 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.830
 artillery shipyard archers 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.750
 manuals is that heavy horses and 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.460
 we can notice that the black carts of 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.740
 reason more garments resistant to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.950
 archers since war wagons 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 they possess many resistance points thing 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.259
 that for another archer the truth that very 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.910
 innovative so thanks to this we can 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.250
 say that the war turrets are 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.369
 excellent against the archers since 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.619
 they have 200 resistance points that's 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.929
 more than a paladin so if we have 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.039
 Koreans if we have an enemy that 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.259
 I can make archers 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.830
 it would be very appropriate to use the turrets 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.830
 of war 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.119
 and now to move on to the cavalry 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.569
 we can see that the war carts 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.450
 they are quite weak to the cavalry 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.660
 as I said before the war wagons 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.290
 they are not very resistant to those weapons that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.470
 are due to the swords we can see 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.260
 that the carts of reason very weak 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.170
 to that and then we can see that the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.599
 letters of war, even if you accursed or cursed 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 use to finish here as I shit the 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.890
 scene the fucking mother is supposed to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.330
 have to attack for again 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.590
 I can not make me get stuck 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.670
 use of shit 24 24 24 24 badly hurt to the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.170
 being yours was going to kill the paladin not 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.629
 it escapes me nobody did not leave and he left 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.900
 badri track how can you cover the 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.900
 fucking mother 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.340
 by the paladin or it can not be it was me 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.359
 he attacked him from here in 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.280
 without opening the door that is in charge 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.450
 how could he stop the scene the damn 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.810
 be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.400
 there is attacked son of a bitch here 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.040
 true that this never happened to me that we 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.620
 for I said they cover themselves but well here 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.909
 supposes that the paladin attacks you and kills 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.280
 the cart, you're going to see how I can 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.780
 happen this these things are supposed to 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.780
 have to go to rock or to me 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.580
 and now finally going to the ceded 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.390
 we can see that the afternoons the blacks of 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.770
 reason quite resistant to cannons 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.770
 they are to gross and scorpions 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.819
 crossed if it escapes in a canyon 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.100
 or anything like that 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.530
 dammit 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.520
 I still can not believe it escaped from 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.520
 all wrong 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.620
 finally to pass to the Chinese 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.260
 we can see that the special unit of 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.490
 the Chinese are also archers are the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.180
 crashed he knows us like shit they say 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.340
 the Chinese 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.500
 and while this unit is much better 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.970
 for the infantry to do much more 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.310
 hurt 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.320
 but also how Korean has its 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.630
 skills to the battery of course 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.380
 everyone will know that the cavalry defeats 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.380
 the archers 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.770
 and also the poplars because the Chinese 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.740
 they are weak to the siege 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.560
 which is all contrary to telcordia 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.199
 they had us the Korean carts are more 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.180
 resistant to the siege practically for 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.050
 beat the Korean cart we need 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.729
 cavalry or a lot of halberdiers with 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.610
 many senators but practically 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.050
 they are very resistant good in this case 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.080
 we have that the Chinese can see that 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.440
 are more vulnerable to the siege of 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.509
 scorpions to zone 2 of the Spanish 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.180
 but they are better against the infantry and 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.729
 they are good against other archers 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.210
 they are equally weak to the 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.210
 chivalry 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.570
 well and going to the Mongols all 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.350
 we know that the game has them in the 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.620
 special unit to the prosecutors that to the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:25.140
 eyes crystals appear elite places 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.140
 well I tell the prosecutors 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.690
 Well these arrested prosecutors are 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.930
 doubts and elites are pretty good 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.270
 for other archers masters comes to say 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.780
 that the mangroves that in cannes are 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.150
 archers before on horseback are good 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 against bars bander move against 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.460
 other archers and they are also good 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.819
 against the siege 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.039
 the next one is weak to the siege then 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.099
 how to apply it let's say that the mangroves 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.830
 they have a faster attack and it makes you 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.650
 much more damage the siege compared 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.560
 of other archers and of course they are 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.080
 rather weak to the cavalry 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.540
 and finally we passed to the Japanese 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.780
 the Japanese have a special unit 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.600
 to the three murals in 13 x 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.000
 and good our samurais x are 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.100
 infantry and the truth that they are quite 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.050
 excellent and the truth that these 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.960
 samurai are pretty good against 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.240
 many signs like the infantry are 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.210
 Archers are excellent against 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.070
 quite resistant also against 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.220
 cavalry are not very good we say 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.560
 find the siege the truth that not the 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.889
 I do not recommend trusting 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.020
 So determined samurai are pretty 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.460
 good in my opinion are one of the 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.639
 best infantry of all 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.229
 talking about the special units and 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.020
 well do not forget that they have the 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.790
 plus to attack a little faster not 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.660
 we must forget that the Japanese have 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:59.880
 the infantry bonus attacked a 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.960
 slightly faster than comparison 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.960
 other infantry 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.129
 and well that was all for the day of 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:14.009
 today I hope I have served you in the 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:15.750
 video I send a greeting to one of 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.900
 our followers that has broken the 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.370
 Paw playing soccer 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:26.430
 women moderates nothing lie give it to me 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.889
 like subscribe and already this week it 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.599
 will be continuing with this series and 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.060
 also with a lot of series that 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:35.419
 I also started number until next time 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.419
 bye 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.919
 no no
