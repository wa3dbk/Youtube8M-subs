but<00:00:59.719> I<00:00:59.750> think<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.199> know<00:01:00.320> over<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.620> past<00:01:00.649> few

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.500 
but I think you know over the past few
years<00:01:01.039> we've<00:01:01.399> tried<00:01:01.519> to<00:01:01.610> really<00:01:01.910> tailor<00:01:02.210> the

licensed music more to really fit the

licensed music more to really fit the

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.530 
vibe and the overall feeling of that
game<00:01:06.619> specifically<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.970> case<00:01:08.119> of<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.390> run

game specifically in the case of the run
you<00:01:08.990> want<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.229> capture<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.650> feel<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:10.040> that

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
you want to capture the feel of that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.270 
you want to capture the feel of that
American<00:01:11.390> culture<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.440> driving<00:01:13.009> across<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
American culture and driving across the

American culture and driving across the
country<00:01:13.430> in<00:01:13.790> America<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.390> what<00:01:14.720> would<00:01:14.990> people

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
country in America and what would people

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.080 
country in America and what would people
that<00:01:15.500> are<00:01:15.619> doing<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.130> race<00:01:16.369> what<00:01:16.850> would<00:01:17.000> they

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
that are doing this race what would they

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.149 
that are doing this race what would they
be<00:01:17.119> listening<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:18.259> listen<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.770> lot<00:01:19.100> of

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
be listening to we listen to a lot of

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.770 
be listening to we listen to a lot of
music<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.909> but<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.030> think<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.330> biggest<00:01:20.509> part

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
music and but I think the biggest part

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.510 
music and but I think the biggest part
of<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.049> really<00:01:21.350> comes<00:01:21.590> from<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.890> gut<00:01:22.040> feeling<00:01:22.430> on

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
of it really comes from a gut feeling on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.789 
of it really comes from a gut feeling on
that<00:01:22.580> band's<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.540> what<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.500> makes<00:01:24.680> you

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
that band's and and what it makes you

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.900 
that band's and and what it makes you
feel<00:01:25.009> when<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.340> hear<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.610> music<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.700> Run

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
feel when you hear this music the Run

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.340 
feel when you hear this music the Run
has<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.509> very<00:01:30.200> specific<00:01:30.500> kind<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.250> sound<00:01:32.350> the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
has a very specific kind of sound the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.680 
has a very specific kind of sound the
creative<00:01:33.740> process<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.429> spurned<00:01:34.820> on<00:01:35.000> actually

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
creative process is spurned on actually

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.540 
creative process is spurned on actually
by<00:01:35.899> looking<00:01:36.229> at<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.710> game<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:36.920> playing<00:01:37.369> it

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
by looking at the game and playing it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.859 
by looking at the game and playing it
especially<00:01:38.030> with<00:01:38.330> Need<00:01:38.450> for<00:01:38.479> Speed<00:01:38.659> the

especially with Need for Speed the

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.600 
especially with Need for Speed the
series<00:01:39.320> I'm<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> fan<00:01:39.830> of<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.069> series<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.550> the

inspiration<00:01:40.880> really<00:01:41.300> it's<00:01:41.690> something<00:01:41.840> that's

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
inspiration really it's something that's

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.960 
inspiration really it's something that's
pretty<00:01:42.289> natural<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.920> me<00:01:43.039> only<00:01:43.310> because<00:01:43.640> it's

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
pretty natural to me only because it's

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.790 
pretty natural to me only because it's
part<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.479> what<00:01:44.630> I've<00:01:44.750> been<00:01:44.780> doing<00:01:45.229> for<00:01:45.259> years

just as a player you can have Orchestra

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.710

sorts<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.099> explosions<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.709> what<00:02:27.890> we<00:02:28.010> try<00:02:28.159> to<00:02:28.220> do

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
sorts of explosions so what we try to do

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.300 
sorts of explosions so what we try to do
is<00:02:28.489> find<00:02:28.670> ways<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:28.970> carve<00:02:29.390> out<00:02:29.599> space<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
is find ways to carve out space so the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.789 
is find ways to carve out space so the
music<00:02:31.549> can<00:02:31.849> actually<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:33.379> to<00:02:33.470> enhance

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
music can actually be there to enhance

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.940 
music can actually be there to enhance
the<00:02:33.980> experience<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.519> emotional<00:02:34.940> experience

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the experience the emotional experience

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.920 
the experience the emotional experience
I'm<00:02:36.950> able<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.400> listen<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.269> car<00:02:38.510> sounds

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
I'm able to listen to the car sounds

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.720 
I'm able to listen to the car sounds
eeeeep<00:02:39.049> it's<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.319> it's<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.560> v6<00:02:39.799> why<00:02:40.459> don't<00:02:40.640> we

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
eeeeep it's like it's a v6 why don't we

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.160 
eeeeep it's like it's a v6 why don't we
do<00:02:40.879> something<00:02:41.329> with<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.599> bass<00:02:41.780> guitar

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
do something with the bass guitar

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.990 
do something with the bass guitar
because<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> v6<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.159> allow<00:02:43.370> bass<00:02:43.640> guitar

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
because the v6 can allow bass guitar

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.390 
because the v6 can allow bass guitar
riff<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.510> well<00:02:45.260> no<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.769> more<00:02:45.890> feet<00:02:46.129> well

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
riff and well no this is more feet well

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.339 
riff and well no this is more feet well
I<00:02:46.430> think<00:02:46.790> maybe<00:02:46.940> like<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.450> higher<00:02:47.870> kind<00:02:48.170> of

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
I think maybe like a higher kind of

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.750 
I think maybe like a higher kind of
guitar<00:02:48.470> might<00:02:48.859> work<00:02:49.040> with<00:02:49.220> some<00:02:49.400> drums

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
guitar might work with some drums

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.759 
guitar might work with some drums
sometimes<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.049> we<00:02:51.319> think<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.650> know

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
sometimes actually we think you know

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.140 
sometimes actually we think you know
what<00:02:51.950> it'd<00:02:52.099> be<00:02:52.340> better<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.700> just<00:02:52.879> cut<00:02:53.030> out

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
what it'd be better to just cut out

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.580 
what it'd be better to just cut out
music<00:02:53.450> here<00:02:53.629> for<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> while<00:02:56.260> we're<00:02:57.260> constantly

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
music here for a while we're constantly

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.619 
music here for a while we're constantly
having<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> figure<00:02:58.160> out<00:02:58.310> ways<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.549> time<00:02:59.269> and

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
having to figure out ways to time and

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.599 
having to figure out ways to time and
trigger<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.140> music<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.650> match<00:03:01.280> the

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
trigger the music to match the

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.220

of a sudden Saul most like the music

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.089

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.470 
knew you were going to the music will be
Ratchet<00:03:10.609> it<00:03:10.700> up<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:10.970> ratcheting<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.299> up<00:03:11.359> and

Ratchet it up and ratcheting it up and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.819 
Ratchet it up and ratcheting it up and
then<00:03:11.569> I'll<00:03:11.629> go<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> some<00:03:12.049> kind<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.290> slow-motion

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
then I'll go to some kind of slow-motion

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.430 
then I'll go to some kind of slow-motion
