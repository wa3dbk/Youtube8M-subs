amazing<00:00:52.289> thing<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.500> artillery<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.460> can

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
amazing thing about artillery they can

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
amazing thing about artillery they can
just<00:00:53.640> aim<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:54.870> even<00:00:54.989> need

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
just aim like this they don't even need

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.400 
just aim like this they don't even need
to<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.440> close<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.940> stuke<00:00:57.270> decides<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
to get close the stuke decides to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
to get close the stuke decides to
retreat<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> pretty<00:01:00.300> clever<00:01:00.690> idea

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
retreat which is a pretty clever idea

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
retreat which is a pretty clever idea
because<00:01:01.680> now<00:01:03.379> Sega<00:01:04.379> Tom<00:01:04.619> can't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.640> hit

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
because now Sega Tom can't really hit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.620 
because now Sega Tom can't really hit
them<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.680> added<00:01:07.950> buddy<00:01:08.189> good<00:01:08.630> but

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
them but it's added buddy good but

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.039 
them but it's added buddy good but
missed<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.250> then<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> Stoke<00:01:11.670> makes<00:01:12.659> mistake

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
missed and then the Stoke makes mistake

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.429 
missed and then the Stoke makes mistake
goes<00:01:13.920> forward<00:01:14.630> dead<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.700> now<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.119> lot<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> time

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
goes forward dead and now a lot of time

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
goes forward dead and now a lot of time
passes<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:21.240> two<00:01:21.540> guys<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:22.259> want

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
passes because these two guys don't want

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.249 
passes because these two guys don't want
to<00:01:22.560> lose<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.490> slowly<00:01:24.060> creep<00:01:24.960> forward<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
to lose so they slowly creep forward and

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
to lose so they slowly creep forward and
yeah<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> same<00:01:28.860> piece<00:01:29.670> slow<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
yeah I would do the same piece slow and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
yeah I would do the same piece slow and
steady<00:01:30.780> wins<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> race<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
steady wins the race when you're to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.920 
steady wins the race when you're to
artillery<00:01:33.299> pieces<00:01:35.090> up<00:01:36.090> against<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.600> Attila
