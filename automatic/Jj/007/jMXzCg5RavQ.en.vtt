that<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> help<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.090> few<00:00:30.359> items<00:00:30.599> that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that with the help of a few items that

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.979 
that with the help of a few items that
being<00:00:31.289> either<00:00:31.500> sugar<00:00:31.830> wheat<00:00:32.489> apples<00:00:33.360> golden

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
being either sugar wheat apples golden

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.020 
being either sugar wheat apples golden
carrots<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.590> golden<00:00:35.370> apples

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
carrots or golden apples

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.350 
carrots or golden apples
so<00:00:36.210> essentially<00:00:37.020> sugar<00:00:37.590> wheat<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.610> apples

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
so essentially sugar wheat and apples

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.959 
so essentially sugar wheat and apples
increase<00:00:40.079> your<00:00:40.350> chances<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> taming<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.700> horse

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.229 
increase your chances of taming a horse
by<00:00:42.540> three<00:00:43.050> percent<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.059> either

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
by three percent so if you have either

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.069 
by three percent so if you have either
34<00:00:45.899> sugar<00:00:46.260> 34<00:00:47.160> weeks<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.670> 34<00:00:48.360> apples<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
34 sugar 34 weeks or 34 apples it is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
34 sugar 34 weeks or 34 apples it is
going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> guarantee<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.270> tame<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
going to guarantee that you can tame a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.119 
going to guarantee that you can tame a
horse<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.379> course<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> don't<00:00:52.949> have

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
horse and of course if you don't have

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.319 
horse and of course if you don't have
that<00:00:53.219> much<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> definitely<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.180> give

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that much you can definitely just give

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
that much you can definitely just give
it<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.680> increase<00:00:56.160> your

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it some and that will increase your

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.090 
it some and that will increase your
chances<00:00:56.789> also<00:00:57.510> golden<00:00:58.170> carrots<00:00:58.649> increase

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
chances also golden carrots increase

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.700 
chances also golden carrots increase
your<00:00:59.250> chances<00:00:59.670> by<00:00:59.850> 5%<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> give<00:01:01.500> them

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
your chances by 5% so if you give them

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
your chances by 5% so if you give them
25<00:01:02.340> golden<00:01:02.850> carrots<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> give<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
25 golden carrots it's going to give you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.640 
25 golden carrots it's going to give you
a<00:01:04.379> 100%<00:01:05.129> chance<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:06.060> taming<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.200> horse<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
a 100% chance of taming the horse and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
a 100% chance of taming the horse and
then<00:01:08.159> golden<00:01:08.640> apples<00:01:08.970> which<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
easily do this so let's go ahead and put

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
easily do this so let's go ahead and put
this<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> test<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.650> give<00:01:31.799> this

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
this to the test so let's give this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.819 
this to the test so let's give this
horse<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.850> 34<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.600> our<00:01:33.990> sugar<00:01:34.350> so
