anything<00:02:24.410> cooked<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.840> enzymes<00:02:27.319> are<00:02:27.530> gone

so<00:02:28.849> now<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.030> pancreas<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:29.750> called<00:02:29.989> upon<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.290> do

so now the pancreas is called upon to do

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
so now the pancreas is called upon to do
another<00:02:30.680> job<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.310> now<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.580> has<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.849> produce

pancreas isn't gorged like a liver
that's<00:03:02.480> enlarged<00:03:03.079> big<00:03:04.010> yes<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.000> can't<00:03:05.180> do

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
that's enlarged big yes but it can't do

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.319 
that's enlarged big yes but it can't do
its<00:03:05.480> job<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:07.069> then<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.819> like<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> domino

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
its job so then it's like a domino

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.390 
its job so then it's like a domino
syndrome<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.799> know<00:03:09.920> what<00:03:10.069> happens

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
syndrome and then you know what happens

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.569 
syndrome and then you know what happens
from<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.450> pancreas<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:12.739> go<00:03:12.920> down<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
from the pancreas you go down to the

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.500 
from the pancreas you go down to the
thymus<00:03:14.420> gland<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.829> other<00:03:16.100> glands<00:03:16.519> happy<00:03:17.329> says
