00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.790
 Daddy, let me give you a cigar 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.900
 probably for heaven's sake 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.670
 I stopped that, you still remember 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.189
 whole year ago 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 we are really proud of you that you 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.899
 Smell another three days if you were there 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.059
 Smoke after the whole day is nothing 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.820
 but the freedom 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:54.020
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.020

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:44.760
