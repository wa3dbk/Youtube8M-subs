gonna be a little different because as I
go<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> release<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:10.020> B<00:01:10.260> pedal<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.740> third

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:57.170 
using a lot of knee levers and moving
around<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.650> be<00:02:49.650> patient<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
around so be patient with it this is

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.729 
around so be patient with it this is
where<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.540> gets<00:02:57.600> complicated<00:02:57.810> right<00:02:58.350> here<00:02:58.620> on

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
where it gets complicated right here on

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.370 
where it gets complicated right here on
