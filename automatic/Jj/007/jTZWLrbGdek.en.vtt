scrubbed
I<00:01:36.329> left<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.290> pink<00:01:37.560> castle<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.189> there

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
I left the little pink castle in there

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
I left the little pink castle in there
because<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.659> turtle<00:01:39.990> seems<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
because I the turtle seems to like it I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
because I the turtle seems to like it I
think<00:01:41.400> he's<00:01:41.549> getting<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.000> big<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
think he's getting a little big for it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
think he's getting a little big for it
see<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.530> he<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.820> he<00:01:44.880> likes

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
see there he is right there but he likes

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.240 
see there he is right there but he likes
to<00:01:45.360> hide<00:01:45.540> inside<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.290> he<00:01:46.380> keeps<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.829> pushing

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to hide inside but he keeps up pushing

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.370 
to hide inside but he keeps up pushing
it<00:01:47.340> around<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.700> tanks<00:01:48.149> oh<00:01:48.299> he's<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> tough

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
little guy and there's little goldfish I
do<00:01:52.770> probably<00:01:53.009> need<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> separate<00:01:53.880> these<00:01:54.210> two

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
do probably need to separate these two

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.440 
do probably need to separate these two
but<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:56.250> tonight<00:01:56.430> they'll<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.969> okay

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
but I think for tonight they'll be okay

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
but I think for tonight they'll be okay
together<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.170> can't<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.310> little

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
together I can't really see this little

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.850 
together I can't really see this little
guy<00:01:59.759> eating<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.390> big<00:02:00.630> ol<00:02:00.780> goldfish<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
guy eating this big ol goldfish so I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.850 
guy eating this big ol goldfish so I
think<00:02:02.310> he'll<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.610> okay<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.719> put<00:02:04.710> in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
think he'll be okay for now I put in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.440 
think he'll be okay for now I put in
this<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.700> turtle<00:02:06.659> which

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
this little turtle which

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.940 
this little turtle which
I<00:02:07.479> didn't<00:02:07.689> think<00:02:07.869> about<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.379> but<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.770> can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
I didn't think about this but you can

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.010 
I didn't think about this but you can
see<00:02:09.129> is<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> turtle's<00:02:09.700> butt<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.539> might<00:02:10.810> have

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
see is a turtle's butt so I might have

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.350 
see is a turtle's butt so I might have
to<00:02:11.170> turn<00:02:11.379> it<00:02:11.560> around<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.519> it's<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:13.090> little

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
to turn it around but it's just a little

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.449 
to turn it around but it's just a little
it's<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> same<00:02:14.349> little<00:02:14.530> float<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.099> turtle

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
it's the same little float in turtle

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.809 
it's the same little float in turtle
that<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.700> put<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.180> when<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.420> had<00:02:16.690> tiny<00:02:17.819> see

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
that I put in there when I had tiny see

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.490 
that I put in there when I had tiny see
there<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.540> that's<00:02:20.110> what<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.410> can

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
there it is and that's what you can

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.820 
there it is and that's what you can
climb<00:02:20.709> up<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:21.069> bask<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.730> placed<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.870> UVB<00:02:23.500> strip

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
climb up and bask I placed a UVB strip

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.430 
climb up and bask I placed a UVB strip
light<00:02:24.069> across<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.700> tank<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.330> also<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
light across the tank and I also have a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.220 
light across the tank and I also have a
heat<00:02:26.739> lamp<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:27.280> balanced<00:02:28.090> over<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.420> top<00:02:28.690> this

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
heat lamp and balanced over the top this

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.339 
heat lamp and balanced over the top this
is<00:02:29.380> all<00:02:29.530> pretty<00:02:29.769> secure<00:02:30.340> on<00:02:30.550> here<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:32.019> wrap

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
is all pretty secure on here and I wrap

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.220 
is all pretty secure on here and I wrap
the<00:02:32.560> cords<00:02:33.130> around<00:02:33.730> here<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.660> they<00:02:34.780> can't<00:02:35.140> be

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
the cords around here so they can't be

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.039 
the cords around here so they can't be
tugged<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.610> they<00:02:37.090> ran<00:02:37.390> they're<00:02:37.540> pretty<00:02:37.780> tight

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
tugged so they ran they're pretty tight

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.600 
tugged so they ran they're pretty tight
there's<00:02:38.379> no<00:02:38.500> way<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:39.010> be<00:02:39.129> tagged<00:02:39.400> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
there's no way they can be tagged and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.070 
there's no way they can be tagged and
it's<00:02:39.730> not<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.090> pull<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.390> light<00:02:40.569> off<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
it's not going to pull the light off and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.280 
it's not going to pull the light off and
then<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.310> extension<00:02:42.760> cords<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.290> for

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
then I have the extension cords just for

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.809 
then I have the extension cords just for
my<00:02:44.349> cameras<00:02:44.709> up<00:02:44.799> charging<00:02:45.280> they'll<00:02:45.430> be<00:02:45.549> tucked

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
my cameras up charging they'll be tucked

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.559 
my cameras up charging they'll be tucked
out<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.150> way<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.319> probably<00:02:47.680> not<00:02:47.769> the

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
out of the way so it's probably not the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.020 
out of the way so it's probably not the
100%<00:02:49.569> safe<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.739> don't<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.220> kids<00:02:51.549> and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
100% safe but we don't have kids and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360 
100% safe but we don't have kids and
it's<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:52.989> my<00:02:53.079> husband<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.769> we'll

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
it's just me and my husband so we'll

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's just me and my husband so we'll
make<00:02:54.489> sure<00:02:54.549> we<00:02:54.849> take<00:02:55.060> extra<00:02:55.360> care<00:02:55.630> around<00:02:55.900> this

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
make sure we take extra care around this

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.319 
make sure we take extra care around this
and<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.829> don't<00:02:57.459> think<00:02:57.760> there's<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.970> way<00:02:58.150> these

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
and I don't think there's a way these

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.900 
and I don't think there's a way these
lights<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:58.989> get<00:02:59.140> yanked<00:02:59.440> off<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.829> here<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.700> he

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
lights can get yanked off of here so he

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.120 
lights can get yanked off of here so he
should<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.480> good

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
should be good

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.100 
should be good
so<00:03:03.130> yeah<00:03:03.370> they<00:03:03.610> seem<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> lot<00:03:04.299> happier<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.959> their

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
so yeah they seem a lot happier in their

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.400 
so yeah they seem a lot happier in their
fresh<00:03:05.470> clean<00:03:05.860> water<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:06.670> threw<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:07.720> some

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
fresh clean water I threw in some

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.140 
fresh clean water I threw in some
rectally<00:03:08.860> pellets<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.459> him<00:03:09.700> but<00:03:09.819> he<00:03:09.910> didn't

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
rectally pellets for him but he didn't

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420 
rectally pellets for him but he didn't
touch<00:03:10.360> them<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.319> have<00:03:11.500> some<00:03:11.709> goldfish<00:03:12.160> food
