experimenting that kind of stuff one of

the secret sauce elements of break is

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.150 
the secret sauce elements of break is
we've<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.740> nailed<00:01:20.100> controls<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
we've really nailed controls the way it

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520 
we've really nailed controls the way it
works<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.580> you'll<00:01:24.180> run<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.750> an<00:01:24.840> obstacle<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
works is you'll run at an obstacle and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.040 
works is you'll run at an obstacle and
if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> hold<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.119> smart<00:01:27.390> button<00:01:27.630> you'll

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
if you hold down the smart button you'll

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.920 
if you hold down the smart button you'll
actually<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:29.009> launched<00:01:29.520> over<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.780> will

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
actually be launched over it and it will

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.980 
actually be launched over it and it will
completely<00:01:31.290> smooth<00:01:31.830> when<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.300> if

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
completely smooth when you do it and if

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.609 
completely smooth when you do it and if
you<00:01:34.110> aim<00:01:34.229> low<00:01:34.530> you'll<00:01:34.950> slide<00:01:35.340> underneath<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
you aim low you'll slide underneath it

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.650 
you aim low you'll slide underneath it
the<00:01:37.619> smart<00:01:37.890> system<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.850> does<00:01:39.060> impact<00:01:39.330> the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the smart system really does impact the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.410 
the smart system really does impact the
way<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> design<00:01:40.200> spaces<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:42.030> sort<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.300> have

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
way you design spaces you sort of have

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.850 
way you design spaces you sort of have
to<00:01:42.509> look<00:01:42.660> at<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> spaces<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> whole<00:01:43.500> different

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
to look at the spaces a whole different

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.999 
to look at the spaces a whole different
way<00:01:44.720> when<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> level<00:01:46.350> designers<00:01:46.800> put

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
way when the level designers put

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.730 
way when the level designers put
together<00:01:47.250> levels<00:01:47.729> they're<00:01:48.479> very<00:01:48.840> careful<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
together levels they're very careful to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.650 
together levels they're very careful to
make<00:01:50.550> sure<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.880> anything<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.479> in

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
make sure that anything they put in

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.779 
make sure that anything they put in
there<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.080> implies<00:01:52.680> some<00:01:53.430> form<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
there which implies some form of

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.969 
there which implies some form of
interaction<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.810> does<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.229> thing<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
interaction actually does that thing and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.650 
interaction actually does that thing and
if<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> doesn't<00:01:56.789> they<00:01:57.000> won't<00:01:57.180> put<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.539> the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
if it doesn't they won't put it in the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.469 
if it doesn't they won't put it in the
first<00:01:57.960> place<00:01:58.050> for<00:01:59.039> us<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.550> brink<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.090> looking

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
first place for us and brink is looking

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.029 
first place for us and brink is looking
more<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> environment<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.800> a

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
more at the environment like you would a

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.190 
more at the environment like you would a
real<00:02:02.280> environment<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.330> opens<00:02:03.660> up<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
real environment just opens up like a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.719 
real environment just opens up like a
million<00:02:04.530> different<00:02:04.649> possibilities<00:02:05.430> really

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
million different possibilities really

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.310 
million different possibilities really
would<00:02:05.880> have

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
would have

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.140 
would have
level<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:09.070> guess<00:02:10.070> what<00:02:10.190> I'm<00:02:10.250> most<00:02:10.759> proud<00:02:11.030> about

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
level I guess what I'm most proud about

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.090 
level I guess what I'm most proud about
with<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.810> smart<00:02:12.080> button<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:12.920> really

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
with the smart button is this is really

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.610 
with the smart button is this is really
utility<00:02:13.790> which<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.270> gonna<00:02:14.480> help<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.320> get
