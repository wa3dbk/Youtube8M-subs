00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
on each side I actually find it really

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.990 
on each side I actually find it really
hard<00:00:43.109> to<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:44.510> even<00:00:45.589> to<00:00:46.589> like<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:47.100> both<00:00:47.670> sides

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
hard to have even to like get both sides

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240 
hard to have even to like get both sides
having<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.140> same<00:00:49.379> amount<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> hair<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
having the same amount of hair it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.419 
having the same amount of hair it's
really<00:00:50.519> hard<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:54.230> with<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> area<00:00:55.829> with

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
really hard for me with the area with

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.450 
really hard for me with the area with
the<00:00:56.969> hair<00:00:57.179> that<00:00:57.390> I've<00:00:58.109> turned<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.129> cat

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just like I guess pull it forward as a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
just like I guess pull it forward as a
way<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.720> separate<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.770> part

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
way to like separate it from the part

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.929 
way to like separate it from the part
