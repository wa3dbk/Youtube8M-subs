the<00:00:53.850> higher<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> food<00:00:55.199> chain

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the higher up you are in the food chain

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.270 
the higher up you are in the food chain
the<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.670> toxic<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.870> tissues<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.129> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the more toxic your tissues are going to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.990 
the more toxic your tissues are going to
be<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.449> basically<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.500> bigger<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> fish<00:01:02.129> the

be so basically the bigger the fish the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899 
be so basically the bigger the fish the
more<00:01:03.329> heavy<00:01:03.899> metal<00:01:04.260> contaminants<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.159> pops4

sistent organic pollutants are going to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.320 
sistent organic pollutants are going to
be<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> fish<00:01:10.760> whereas<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.909> you're<00:01:12.030> eating

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
be in that fish whereas if you're eating

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.499 
be in that fish whereas if you're eating
the<00:01:12.420> algae<00:01:13.610> because<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.090> low<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the algae because it's so low on the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.950 
the algae because it's so low on the
food<00:01:15.659> chain<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> algae<00:01:16.290> isn't<00:01:16.770> consuming

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
food chain and the algae isn't consuming

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.940 
food chain and the algae isn't consuming
products<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> algae<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
products in the water the algae is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
products in the water the algae is
simply<00:01:20.310> using<00:01:20.790> minerals<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.479> sunlight

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
simply using minerals and sunlight

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.760 
simply using minerals and sunlight
through<00:01:22.439> photosynthesis<00:01:23.960> on<00:01:24.960> carbon<00:01:25.320> dioxide

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
through photosynthesis on carbon dioxide

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.710 
through photosynthesis on carbon dioxide
to<00:01:26.460> create<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> sugars<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> needs<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to create the sugars that it needs and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.340 
to create the sugars that it needs and
the<00:01:27.780> proteins<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.409> needs<00:01:30.049> algae<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.110> not

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the proteins that it needs algae is not

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
the proteins that it needs algae is not
really<00:01:31.710> contaminated<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> fish<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really contaminated but the fish that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
really contaminated but the fish that
eat<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> algae<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.829> another<00:01:35.009> fish<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
eat the algae and then another fish and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
eat the algae and then another fish and
then<00:01:35.549> another<00:01:35.790> fish<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.560> build<00:01:37.740> up

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
then another fish they they build up

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.569 
then another fish they they build up
toxins<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.600> persistent<00:01:39.600> organic<00:01:39.689> pollutants

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
toxins and persistent organic pollutants

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
toxins and persistent organic pollutants
so<00:01:41.659> just<00:01:42.659> about<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:42.990> fish<00:01:43.200> you're<00:01:43.350> gonna<00:01:43.470> eat

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so just about all fish you're gonna eat

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.569 
so just about all fish you're gonna eat
is<00:01:44.220> gonna<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.520> highly<00:01:44.790> contaminated<00:01:45.090> secondly

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
is gonna be highly contaminated secondly

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.120 
is gonna be highly contaminated secondly
fish<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.930> northern<00:01:49.110> waters<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> fish

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
fish in these northern waters the fish

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.700 
fish in these northern waters the fish
that<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.549> epa<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.329> DHA<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:52.020> large<00:01:52.259> amounts

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that have epa and DHA in large amounts

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
that have epa and DHA in large amounts
which<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> algae<00:01:53.850> produced<00:01:54.180> by<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> way<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
which the algae produced by the way the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
which the algae produced by the way the
fish<00:01:54.869> don't<00:01:55.079> produce<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.070> algae<00:01:56.520> produce

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
fish don't produce it the algae produce

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.389 
fish don't produce it the algae produce
it<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> fish<00:01:57.570> eat<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> algae<00:01:58.399> so

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it and then the fish eat the algae so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.620 
it and then the fish eat the algae so
that's<00:01:59.700> where<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> fish<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.329> getting<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that's where the fish are getting it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
that's where the fish are getting it
from<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.829> epa<00:02:02.189> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
from so if you really want your epa and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.630 
from so if you really want your epa and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.719 
DHA ithi algae cut out the middleman cut
out<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.909> toxins<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:07.290> also<00:02:07.459> these<00:02:08.459> northern

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
out the toxins but also these northern

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
out the toxins but also these northern

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.009 
of parasites fish are high in
cholesterol<00:02:52.430> saturated<00:02:53.430> fats<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.900> you're

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
cooking them you're oxidizing those fats

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.199

fats the EPA and the DHA these are

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.630 
fats the EPA and the DHA these are
polyunsaturated<00:03:09.900> fats<00:03:10.769> which<00:03:11.190> means<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
polyunsaturated fats which means that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.210 
polyunsaturated fats which means that
they're<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.150> very<00:03:12.510> unstable<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:13.530> they

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
they're very very unstable because they

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.949 
they're very very unstable because they
have<00:03:14.340> several<00:03:14.670> points<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.299> unsaturation

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
have several points of unsaturation

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.050 
have several points of unsaturation
which<00:03:16.829> means<00:03:17.069> there<00:03:17.310> are<00:03:17.400> several<00:03:17.790> points

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
which means there are several points

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.960 
which means there are several points
where<00:03:18.419> oxygen<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.290> other<00:03:19.470> things<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:20.579> bond

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
where oxygen and other things can bond

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.309 
where oxygen and other things can bond
to<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.450> fat<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.230> oxidize<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:23.069> or<00:03:23.190> damage<00:03:23.489> it

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
to that fat and oxidize it or damage it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.180 
to that fat and oxidize it or damage it
so<00:03:25.940> polyunsaturated<00:03:26.940> fats<00:03:27.599> do<00:03:28.049> not<00:03:28.380> heat<00:03:28.859> well

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
so polyunsaturated fats do not heat well

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.270 
so polyunsaturated fats do not heat well
at<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:30.150> should<00:03:30.329> never<00:03:30.540> heat<00:03:30.840> these<00:03:30.989> fats

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
at all you should never heat these fats

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.949 
at all you should never heat these fats
so<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.340> you're<00:03:32.489> cooking<00:03:32.639> your<00:03:32.940> fish<00:03:33.209> you're

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
so if you're cooking your fish you're

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.750 
so if you're cooking your fish you're
turning<00:03:34.380> many<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:34.859> beneficial<00:03:35.370> fats

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
turning many of these beneficial fats

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.409 
turning many of these beneficial fats
into<00:03:36.060> very<00:03:36.660> dangerous<00:03:37.549> lipid<00:03:38.549> peroxides<00:03:39.090> or

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
into very dangerous lipid peroxides or

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.710 
into very dangerous lipid peroxides or
radical<00:03:39.930> compounds<00:03:40.549> so<00:03:41.549> if<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.209> eat<00:03:42.419> the<00:03:42.540> fish

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
radical compounds so if you eat the fish

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.599 
radical compounds so if you eat the fish
raw<00:03:42.989> you're<00:03:43.560> still<00:03:43.799> getting<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.069> chemicals

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
raw you're still getting the chemicals

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.550 
raw you're still getting the chemicals
the<00:03:45.120> pollutants<00:03:45.660> you're<00:03:46.049> still<00:03:46.290> getting<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the pollutants you're still getting the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.309 
the pollutants you're still getting the
TMAO<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.609> you're<00:03:48.510> also<00:03:48.690> getting<00:03:49.169> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
TMAO and you're also getting the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.030 
TMAO and you're also getting the
parasites

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
parasites

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.770 
parasites
if<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.430> cook<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.819> fish<00:03:50.849> you're<00:03:51.419> getting<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
if you cook the fish you're getting the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.330 
if you cook the fish you're getting the
pollutants<00:03:52.230> you're<00:03:52.500> getting<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.799> TMAO

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
pollutants you're getting the TMAO

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.680 
pollutants you're getting the TMAO
and<00:03:53.549> now<00:03:54.000> you're<00:03:54.180> getting<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.480> lipid

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
and now you're getting the lipid

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.500 
and now you're getting the lipid
peroxides<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:56.519> if<00:03:56.730> your<00:03:56.849> reason<00:03:57.180> for<00:03:57.389> eating

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
peroxides so if your reason for eating

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.280 
peroxides so if your reason for eating
the<00:03:57.750> fish<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:59.489> essential<00:03:59.910> fatty<00:04:00.090> acids<00:04:00.569> go

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
the fish is the essential fatty acids go

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.379 
the fish is the essential fatty acids go
to<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.500> algae<00:04:01.799> much<00:04:02.700> much<00:04:02.940> better<00:04:03.150> source

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
to the algae much much better source

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.080 
to the algae much much better source
without<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> complications<00:04:04.819> so<00:04:05.819> yeah<00:04:06.060> I

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
without the complications so yeah I

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.770 
without the complications so yeah I
really<00:04:06.329> also<00:04:06.989> fish<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.560> very<00:04:08.129> high<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.780> it'll

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
really also fish is very high and it'll

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.199 
really also fish is very high and it'll
make<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.959> 6<00:04:10.349> fatty<00:04:10.620> acid<00:04:11.129> called<00:04:11.699> arachidonic

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
make a 6 fatty acid called arachidonic

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.650 
make a 6 fatty acid called arachidonic
acid<00:04:12.889> and<00:04:13.889> arachidonic<00:04:14.310> acid<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:15.060> highly

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
acid and arachidonic acid is highly

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.319 
acid and arachidonic acid is highly
inflammatory<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.680> human<00:04:16.889> body<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:18.030> yes

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
inflammatory in the human body so yes

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.779 
inflammatory in the human body so yes
you<00:04:18.510> are<00:04:18.660> getting<00:04:18.959> omega<00:04:19.199> threes<00:04:19.639> many<00:04:20.639> of

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
you are getting omega threes many of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.159 
you are getting omega threes many of
them<00:04:20.880> are<00:04:20.970> oxidized<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.870> therefore

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
them are oxidized and therefore

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.719 
them are oxidized and therefore
dangerous<00:04:22.500> but<00:04:22.680> you're<00:04:22.770> also<00:04:22.919> getting<00:04:23.219> a<00:04:23.370> lot

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
dangerous but you're also getting a lot

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.040 
dangerous but you're also getting a lot
of<00:04:24.140> omega-6<00:04:25.140> from<00:04:25.620> Iraq

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
of omega-6 from Iraq

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.659 
of omega-6 from Iraq
Janak<00:04:26.289> acid<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:26.979> is<00:04:27.220> highly

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
Janak acid and that is highly

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.960 
Janak acid and that is highly
inflammatory<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:31.120> don't<00:04:31.389> like<00:04:31.509> in<00:04:31.629> that<00:04:31.720> fish
