 It was born in Mitsubishi, which completely restructured itself after suspending the wrc card for one year in 2003 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:39.320
 It will be state-of-the-art gold of the time 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:42.829
 It is the exterior of the car that is overwhelmed by cars 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.559
 Front fender overhangs like a dtm machine 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.559

 wr car regulations are adopted 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.260

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:58.620
 But Mitsubishi only thinks that wrc is worth fighting if it is close to a commercial vehicle 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.090
 It agrees with the conventional group a south to 54 as it is 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.500
 Drivers' title corridor is superb down Tommi MÃ¤kinen 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.820

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.069
 The commitment to the Mitsubishi was enhanced to the result
