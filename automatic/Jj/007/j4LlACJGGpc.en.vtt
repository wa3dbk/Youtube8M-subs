it's<00:00:00.480> been<00:00:00.690> about<00:00:00.870> six<00:00:01.260> weeks<00:00:01.380> since<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
it's been about six weeks since the

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.130 
it's been about six weeks since the
tobacco<00:00:02.370> was<00:00:02.639> first<00:00:02.879> transplanted<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.929> in

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
tobacco was first transplanted and in

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.570 
tobacco was first transplanted and in
that<00:00:04.350> time<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:04.890> grown<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> height<00:00:05.549> of

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
that time it's grown to a height of

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.509 
that time it's grown to a height of
about<00:00:05.790> three<00:00:06.210> feet<00:00:06.420> tall<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:07.020> may<00:00:08.010> notice<00:00:08.400> a

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
about three feet tall you may notice a

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.879 
about three feet tall you may notice a
little<00:00:08.730> bit<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.940> white<00:00:09.179> residue<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.290> plants

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
little bit of white residue on my plants

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.770 
little bit of white residue on my plants
and<00:00:11.040> that's<00:00:11.099> because<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> had<00:00:12.150> sprinkled<00:00:12.660> them

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and that's because I had sprinkled them

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.900 
and that's because I had sprinkled them
recently<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.920> little<00:00:14.280> bit<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.460> Sevendust

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
recently with a little bit of Sevendust

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.840 
recently with a little bit of Sevendust
it's<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.109> only<00:00:16.230> pesticide<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> use<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.789> I

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it's the only pesticide that I use and I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120 
it's the only pesticide that I use and I
typically<00:00:18.270> only<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.320> help<00:00:19.650> protect

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
typically only use it to help protect

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.800 
typically only use it to help protect
the<00:00:20.250> plants<00:00:20.430> until<00:00:21.000> they're<00:00:21.240> at<00:00:21.330> least<00:00:21.390> about

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the plants until they're at least about

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.769 
the plants until they're at least about
three<00:00:21.869> feet<00:00:22.380> tall<00:00:23.150> I've<00:00:24.150> been<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:24.539> busy

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
three feet tall I've been really busy

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.630 
three feet tall I've been really busy
with<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.350> lately<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> haven't<00:00:26.310> had<00:00:26.430> much

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
with work lately and haven't had much

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
with work lately and haven't had much
time<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> weed<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> garden<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.500> much<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
time to weed in the garden as much as I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.030 
time to weed in the garden as much as I
should<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.910> also<00:00:30.449> bear<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.840> mind<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.470> once

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
should but also bear in mind that once

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.370 
should but also bear in mind that once
the<00:00:32.160> plants<00:00:32.640> reach<00:00:32.910> about<00:00:33.300> three<00:00:33.780> feet<00:00:34.020> tall

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the plants reach about three feet tall

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.610 
the plants reach about three feet tall
or<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.880> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:37.020> without<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
or so you can actually do without the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
or so you can actually do without the
weeding<00:00:37.980> entirely<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.450> really

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
weeding entirely if you if you really

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.260 
weeding entirely if you if you really
have<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.250> just<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> plants<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
have to just because the plants are so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
have to just because the plants are so
big<00:00:42.649> it's<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.070> hard<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.700> between

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
big it's kind of hard to get in between

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.510 
big it's kind of hard to get in between
the<00:00:45.270> plants<00:00:45.539> anyway

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
the plants anyway

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
the plants anyway
now<00:00:47.520> I'll<00:00:47.700> show<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.660> subtle<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
now I'll show you some of the subtle and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.529 
now I'll show you some of the subtle and
some<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.309> subtle<00:00:50.910> differences<00:00:51.480> between

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
some not so subtle differences between

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.889 
some not so subtle differences between
the<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.590> tobacco<00:00:52.980> varieties<00:00:53.899> right

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the different tobacco varieties right

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.139 
the different tobacco varieties right
here<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.469> black<00:00:55.800> sea's<00:00:56.100> Sampson<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> as

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here we have black sea's Sampson and as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
here we have black sea's Sampson and as
you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.020> leaves<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.620> typically

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you can see the leaves are typically

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.849 
you can see the leaves are typically
really<00:00:59.690> small<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.899> comparison<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.590> other

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really small in comparison to other

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.160 
really small in comparison to other
varieties<00:01:02.640> they're<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.390> shorter<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.019> more

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
varieties they're a lot shorter and more

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
varieties they're a lot shorter and more
narrow<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.850> also<00:01:05.939> fewer<00:01:06.600> leaves

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
narrow and there are also fewer leaves

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170 
narrow and there are also fewer leaves
on<00:01:07.320> each<00:01:07.530> plant<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
on each plant so you can actually see a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.620 
on each plant so you can actually see a
lot<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> stock<00:01:10.680> itself<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.479> we

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
lot more of the stock itself and here we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
lot more of the stock itself and here we
have<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.869> example<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> havana<00:01:14.130> variety

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have an example of the havana variety

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.149 
have an example of the havana variety
which<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.930> much<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.619> robust

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
which as you can see is much more robust

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.120 
which as you can see is much more robust
with<00:01:17.640> long<00:01:18.119> broad<00:01:18.600> leaves<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.500> taper<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
with long broad leaves that taper to a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.910 
with long broad leaves that taper to a
point<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.759> ends<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.710> some

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
point at the ends and here is some

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100 
point at the ends and here is some
verging<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> gold<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> very<00:01:24.479> similar<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
verging a gold which is very similar to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.920 
verging a gold which is very similar to
the<00:01:25.259> Havana<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.040> has<00:01:26.340> slightly<00:01:27.030> smaller<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

more<00:01:28.200> rounded<00:01:28.829> leaves<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> Havana<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
more rounded leaves in the Havana and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
more rounded leaves in the Havana and
also<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> slightly<00:01:31.439> more<00:01:31.770> yellowish<00:01:32.189> color

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

as<00:01:53.700> soon<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:53.940> you<00:01:54.030> lift<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> leaf<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
as soon as you lift the leaf up and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.170
