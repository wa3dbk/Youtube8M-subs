accessory pack if you bend or break a
wire<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.960> replace<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.310> not

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
wire you just replace it and you're not

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
wire you just replace it and you're not
out<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.270> lots<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.869> dollars<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
out you know lots of dollars so the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
out you know lots of dollars so the
values<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.600> lot<00:01:51.990> of

other things that are unique about this

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
other things that are unique about this
fate<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.329> again<00:01:54.689> other<00:01:54.960> than<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> wires

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
fate that again other than the wires

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.580 
fate that again other than the wires
changing<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.689> gives<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:57.930> advantage<00:01:58.049> over
