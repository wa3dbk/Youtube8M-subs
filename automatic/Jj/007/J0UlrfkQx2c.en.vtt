actually the macbook air maybe not

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.320

aluminum<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.930> by<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> back<00:01:31.680> plate<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.220> is

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
aluminum up by that back plate it is

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.149 
aluminum up by that back plate it is
super<00:01:32.939> thin<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.689> light<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:35.040> could

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
super thin and so light and you could

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.649 
super thin and so light and you could
probably<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.610> clean<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.299> dust<00:01:36.479> out

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
probably actually clean some dust out

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
probably actually clean some dust out
from<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.049> will<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:37.670> but

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
from in there will you have it off but

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
from in there will you have it off but
here's<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> inside<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.229> macbook<00:01:40.409> pro

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
here's the inside of the macbook pro

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
here's the inside of the macbook pro
this<00:01:40.950> happens<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> 13-inch<00:01:42.060> I've<00:01:42.210> seen

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this happens to be a 13-inch I've seen

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
this happens to be a 13-inch I've seen
the<00:01:42.509> 15s<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> 17<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.189> bit

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the 15s on the 17 just a little bit

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.330 
the 15s on the 17 just a little bit
bigger<00:01:44.549> more<00:01:44.909> stuff<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.590> are

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
bigger more stuff in there if you are

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
bigger more stuff in there if you are
interested<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.939> ram<00:01:48.210> tutorial<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
interested in that ram tutorial I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
interested in that ram tutorial I
mentioned<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.200> yesterday's<00:01:49.619> video<00:01:49.799> somebody

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
mentioned in yesterday's video somebody

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.889 
mentioned in yesterday's video somebody
asked<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:50.850> how<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.180> RAM<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> had<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
asked me how to put RAM in here I had a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780 
asked me how to put RAM in here I had a
video<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> channel<00:01:52.380> before<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.670> that

I've got it open i'll just show you it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740 
I've got it open i'll just show you it's
pretty<00:01:55.500> simple<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.790> ram<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.119> right<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.509> it's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
pretty simple the ram is right here it's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
pretty simple the ram is right here it's
these<00:01:58.040> green<00:01:59.040> things<00:01:59.070> held<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.670> by<00:01:59.790> clips

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
these green things held in by clips

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.639 
these green things held in by clips
there's<00:02:00.360> two<00:02:00.540> bays<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.810> they're<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
there's two bays and they're on top of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.929 
there's two bays and they're on top of
each<00:02:01.740> other<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.130> you're<00:02:02.250> talking<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.700> ram

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
each other if you're talking about ram

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.050 
each other if you're talking about ram
it<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.409> ddr3<00:02:04.409> laptop<00:02:04.890> ram<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.820> pull

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it is ddr3 laptop ram so you just pull

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.789 
it is ddr3 laptop ram so you just pull
those<00:02:06.240> clips<00:02:06.570> apart<00:02:06.930> from<00:02:07.079> each<00:02:07.200> other<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
those clips apart from each other it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
those clips apart from each other it
pulls<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.399> about<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.640> 30<00:02:08.940> degree<00:02:09.119> angle<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
pulls up at about a 30 degree angle and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.470 
pulls up at about a 30 degree angle and
then<00:02:09.959> pull<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.530> straight<00:02:10.800> out<00:02:11.009> towards<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
then pull it straight out towards you I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.940 
then pull it straight out towards you I
got<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> Ram<00:02:13.680> from

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
got this Ram from

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.210 
got this Ram from

something like that it is i have got
eight<00:02:20.519> gig<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.849> here<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> four<00:02:21.690> gig

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
eight gig in here so this is a four gig

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
eight gig in here so this is a four gig
stick<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.470> below<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:23.010> also<00:02:23.160> four

stick and the one below it is also four

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.850 
stick and the one below it is also four
gigs<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.810> push<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.110> back<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.440> push<00:02:25.709> it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
gigs and then to push it back in push it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.650 
gigs and then to push it back in push it
in<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.190> 30<00:02:26.370> degree<00:02:26.580> angle<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.120> then

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
in on a 30 degree angle and then

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
in on a 30 degree angle and then
straight<00:02:28.019> down<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.500> it'll<00:02:29.040> click<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
straight down and it'll click and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.620 
straight down and it'll click and
there's<00:02:29.700> two<00:02:29.879> in<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.300> repeat<00:02:30.599> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
there's two in there just repeat the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.960 
there's two in there just repeat the
process<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> second<00:02:31.620> one<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.519> we've<00:02:32.819> got

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
process for the second one but we've got

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.300 
process for the second one but we've got
this<00:02:33.150> open<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.959> here's<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.620> hard<00:02:34.769> drive<00:02:35.040> this

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this open so here's the hard drive this

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.470 
this open so here's the hard drive this
is<00:02:35.489> currently<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> hitachi<00:02:37.190> 5400<00:02:38.190> RPM<00:02:38.580> 320<00:02:39.269> gig

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
is currently a hitachi 5400 RPM 320 gig

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.589 
is currently a hitachi 5400 RPM 320 gig
now<00:02:39.900> i<00:02:39.930> only<00:02:40.319> got<00:02:40.739> another<00:02:41.099> 320<00:02:41.910> gig<00:02:42.150> because

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
now i only got another 320 gig because

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.690 
now i only got another 320 gig because
it's<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:43.769> platter<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.489> going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> be

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it's one platter so it's going to be

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.400 
it's one platter so it's going to be
faster<00:02:45.200> here's<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.319> battery<00:02:46.590> DVD<00:02:47.280> Drive<00:02:47.519> fan

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
faster here's the battery DVD Drive fan

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.320 
faster here's the battery DVD Drive fan
motherboard<00:02:49.410> system<00:02:49.920> components<00:02:50.430> alright<00:02:51.209> so

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
motherboard system components alright so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.699 
motherboard system components alright so
I've<00:02:51.420> actually<00:02:51.569> never<00:02:51.840> done<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.200> hard<00:02:52.530> drive

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
I've actually never done a hard drive

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.960 
I've actually never done a hard drive
replacement<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:53.579> I'm<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.849> guess

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
replacement here but I'm going to guess

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.270 
replacement here but I'm going to guess
it's<00:02:54.120> not<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.420> hard<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.099> looks

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
it's not that hard all right so it looks

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.059 
it's not that hard all right so it looks
like<00:02:56.340> we're<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:56.970> need<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.829> take<00:02:58.829> off

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
like we're going to need to take off

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.920 
like we're going to need to take off
these<00:02:59.400> two<00:02:59.730> screws<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.390> there<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.630> front<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
these two screws here there in front of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.750 
these two screws here there in front of
the<00:03:00.989> hard<00:03:01.170> drive<00:03:01.380> towards<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.920> DVD<00:03:02.310> drive<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the hard drive towards the DVD drive and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.100 
the hard drive towards the DVD drive and
it<00:03:03.090> looks<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.420> they're<00:03:03.599> just<00:03:03.780> about<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
it looks like they're just about the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.569 
it looks like they're just about the
same<00:03:04.260> size<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.920> ones<00:03:05.069> we<00:03:05.220> took<00:03:05.400> off

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
same size as the ones we took off

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.350 
same size as the ones we took off
earlier<00:03:06.060> from<00:03:06.959> around<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.380> case<00:03:07.670> okay<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.730> I

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
earlier from around the case okay so I

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.089 
earlier from around the case okay so I
took<00:03:09.660> those<00:03:10.019> out<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.470> just<00:03:10.620> use<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> same

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
took those out you just use the same

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.740 
took those out you just use the same
screwdriver<00:03:11.610> worked<00:03:11.910> fine<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.569> piece

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
screwdriver worked fine and this piece

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.449 
screwdriver worked fine and this piece
of<00:03:12.900> plastic<00:03:13.260> comes<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> hard

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
of plastic comes out and now the hard

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.580 
of plastic comes out and now the hard
drive<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.790> loosened<00:03:15.209> here<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:16.079> we<00:03:16.140> pull<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.470> out

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
drive is loosened here so we pull it out

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.860 
drive is loosened here so we pull it out
like<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.370> then<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> SATA<00:03:18.180> connector<00:03:18.690> is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
like this and then the SATA connector is

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.270 
like this and then the SATA connector is
on<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.440> head<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.769> drive<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.250> that

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
on the head of the drive like that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.849 
on the head of the drive like that
notice<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.209> black<00:03:21.870> string<00:03:22.290> comes<00:03:22.530> over<00:03:22.739> there

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
notice the black string comes over there

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.740 
notice the black string comes over there
and<00:03:23.040> plugs<00:03:23.280> into<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.700> motherboard<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.600> one

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
and plugs into the motherboard the one

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.370 
and plugs into the motherboard the one
next<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.290> most<00:03:25.709> likely<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.190> DVD<00:03:26.700> Drive

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
next to it is most likely the DVD Drive

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.410 
next to it is most likely the DVD Drive
so<00:03:28.380> now<00:03:28.590> without<00:03:28.859> damaging<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.819> cable<00:03:30.239> that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
so now without damaging this cable that

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.720 
so now without damaging this cable that
is<00:03:30.450> very<00:03:30.810> important<00:03:31.230> important<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.519> just

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
is very important important that just

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
is very important important that just
kind<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:32.940> pulls<00:03:33.150> out<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.690> there's

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
kind of pulls out just like that there's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.840 
kind of pulls out just like that there's
your<00:03:34.319> SATA<00:03:34.560> connection<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> here's<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.700> old

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
your SATA connection and here's the old

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.830 
your SATA connection and here's the old
hard<00:03:36.030> drive<00:03:36.440> lay<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.470> aside<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.840> actually

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
hard drive lay that aside and actually

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.319 
hard drive lay that aside and actually
on<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.319> sides<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.730> looks<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.120> there

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
on the sides of this it looks like there

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.360 
on the sides of this it looks like there
are<00:03:42.359> little<00:03:42.660> pegs<00:03:43.109> if<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.889> can<00:03:44.040> see<00:03:44.250> they

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
are little pegs if you can see they

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460 
are little pegs if you can see they
stick<00:03:44.670> out<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.480> believe<00:03:46.200> we're

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
stick out like that I believe we're

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.020 
stick out like that I believe we're
going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.920> move<00:03:47.069> those<00:03:47.310> over<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
going to have to move those over to the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
going to have to move those over to the
new<00:03:48.239> ones<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:49.019> new<00:03:49.200> drive<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.040> screws

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
new ones the new drive if the screws

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.550 
new ones the new drive if the screws
matchup<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.269> looks<00:03:51.450> like<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.810> does<00:03:52.049> so

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
matchup and it looks like it does so

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.530 
matchup and it looks like it does so
take<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.889> pegs<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.400> day<00:03:53.459> old<00:03:53.730> drive<00:03:54.000> there<00:03:54.329> in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
take the pegs a day old drive there in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.030 
take the pegs a day old drive there in
the<00:03:54.660> side<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.049> hard<00:03:55.230> drive<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.620> screw

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the side of the hard drive and screw

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.550 
the side of the hard drive and screw
them<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.340> holes<00:03:56.519> on<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.910> new<00:03:57.000> hard<00:03:57.180> drive

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
them in the holes on the new hard drive

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.110 
them in the holes on the new hard drive
alright<00:03:58.560> minor<00:03:58.799> correction<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.730> things<00:03:59.940> on

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
alright minor correction the things on

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.910 
alright minor correction the things on
the<00:04:00.150> sides<00:04:00.389> are<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:00.690> actually<00:04:01.109> screw<00:04:01.500> driven

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
the sides are not actually screw driven

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.319 
the sides are not actually screw driven
it's<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.250> thing<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.459> looks<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.910> star

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
it's the thing that looks like a star

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.750 
it's the thing that looks like a star
and<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:03.840> can't<00:04:04.109> find<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.530> sets<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.519> go<00:04:05.609> in<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and I can't find the sets that go in the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.729 
and I can't find the sets that go in the
end<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.030> my<00:04:06.090> screwdriver<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:06.930> I'm<00:04:07.470> going<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.680> be

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
end of my screwdriver so I'm going to be

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.319 
end of my screwdriver so I'm going to be
using<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:08.069> pair<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.310> needlenose<00:04:08.609> pliers<00:04:09.060> it

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
using a pair of needlenose pliers it

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.520 
using a pair of needlenose pliers it
seems<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.720> they're<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.079> threaded<00:04:10.410> in

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
seems like they're just threaded in

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.900 
seems like they're just threaded in
there<00:04:10.739> they're<00:04:11.069> not<00:04:11.160> torqued<00:04:11.549> down<00:04:11.639> or

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
there they're not torqued down or

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.550 
there they're not torqued down or
anything<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.480> guess<00:04:13.109> if<00:04:13.290> you're<00:04:13.410> going<00:04:13.500> to

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
anything so I guess if you're going to

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.229 
anything so I guess if you're going to
do<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.769> this<00:04:13.859> way<00:04:14.040> just<00:04:14.669> be<00:04:14.760> careful<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.120> don't

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
do it this way just be careful you don't

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.349 
do it this way just be careful you don't
put<00:04:15.540> them<00:04:15.599> in<00:04:15.720> too<00:04:15.870> hard<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.349> screw<00:04:16.859> em<00:04:16.919> up

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
put them in too hard and screw em up

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.550 
put them in too hard and screw em up
alright<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.539> just<00:04:18.900> took<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.169> few<00:04:19.320> minutes

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
alright so that just took a few minutes

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.370 
alright so that just took a few minutes
to<00:04:20.280> get<00:04:20.400> those<00:04:20.729> little<00:04:21.209> pegs<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.630> there<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.260> now

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
to get those little pegs in there so now

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.110 
to get those little pegs in there so now
we're<00:04:22.590> going<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:23.010> go<00:04:23.430> ahead<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.610> connect<00:04:24.000> up

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
we're going to go ahead and connect up

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.670 
we're going to go ahead and connect up
the<00:04:24.150> SATA<00:04:24.539> cable<00:04:24.960> well<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.169> think<00:04:25.380> there's<00:04:25.530> only

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
the SATA cable well I think there's only

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.350 
the SATA cable well I think there's only
one<00:04:25.950> way<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.190> do<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.460> because

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
one way to do this because

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.379 
one way to do this because
looks<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:27.870> there's<00:04:28.080> two<00:04:28.849> data<00:04:29.849> connections

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
looks like there's two data connections

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.240 
looks like there's two data connections
and<00:04:30.629> then<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.960> smaller<00:04:31.439> one<00:04:31.650> obviously<00:04:31.949> lines

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
and then the smaller one obviously lines

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.580 
and then the smaller one obviously lines
up<00:04:32.430> with<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.580> smaller<00:04:32.879> line<00:04:33.659> it<00:04:33.780> up<00:04:33.870> give<00:04:34.409> it<00:04:34.439> a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
up with the smaller line it up give it a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.709 
up with the smaller line it up give it a
push<00:04:34.800> there<00:04:35.129> it<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:36.000> now<00:04:36.120> it's<00:04:36.330> just<00:04:36.539> kind

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
push there it is so now it's just kind

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.999 
push there it is so now it's just kind
of<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.840> reverse<00:04:37.560> installation<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:39.889> lining<00:04:40.889> up

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
of a reverse installation of lining up

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.520 
of a reverse installation of lining up
these<00:04:41.219> pegs<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.939> the<00:04:42.000> inside<00:04:42.900> holes<00:04:43.199> here

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
these pegs in the inside holes here

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.709 
these pegs in the inside holes here
close<00:04:44.189> to<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.430> outside<00:04:44.759> machine<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.360> then

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
close to the outside machine and then

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:46.999 
close to the outside machine and then
we're<00:04:45.810> going<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.960> put<00:04:46.169> this<00:04:46.349> thing<00:04:46.560> back<00:04:46.770> in

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
we're going to put this thing back in

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.909 
we're going to put this thing back in
that<00:04:47.099> we<00:04:47.219> took<00:04:47.370> out<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.550> few<00:04:47.729> minutes<00:04:47.789> ago<00:04:48.150> and

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
that we took out a few minutes ago and

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.679 
that we took out a few minutes ago and
the<00:04:49.919> pegs<00:04:50.159> kind<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.699> line<00:04:50.849> up<00:04:51.000> there<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.479> that

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
the pegs kind of line up there to that

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.510 
the pegs kind of line up there to that
just<00:04:52.259> sits<00:04:52.439> on<00:04:52.560> top<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.009> hard<00:04:53.159> drive<00:04:53.340> so

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
just sits on top of the hard drive so

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.309 
just sits on top of the hard drive so
we'll<00:04:53.639> line<00:04:53.819> that<00:04:54.030> up<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.419> screw<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.169> back

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
we'll line that up and screw it back

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.649 
we'll line that up and screw it back
down<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:56.009> should<00:04:56.219> mention<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.789> as<00:04:57.330> soon

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
down and I should mention that as soon

as I got the old hard drive out or the
new<00:05:01.349> hard<00:05:01.529> drive<00:05:01.740> out<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.389> had<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.509> new<00:05:03.659> one

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
new hard drive out and had the new one

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.679 
new hard drive out and had the new one
right<00:05:03.990> here<00:05:04.289> I<00:05:04.469> took<00:05:04.889> this<00:05:05.849> little<00:05:06.150> flap<00:05:06.389> tab

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
putting on our aluminum cover before I

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.610 
putting on our aluminum cover before I
do<00:05:36.240> that<00:05:36.389> I'm<00:05:36.659> going<00:05:36.779> to<00:05:36.870> vacuum<00:05:36.990> some<00:05:37.409> dust

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620

out of the fan area there and clean off
this<00:05:39.479> back<00:05:39.690> plate<00:05:40.050> but<00:05:40.349> that'll<00:05:41.339> be<00:05:41.430> back<00:05:41.610> on

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
this back plate but that'll be back on

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.600 
this back plate but that'll be back on
in<00:05:41.879> just<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.210> second<00:05:42.539> and<00:05:43.349> that<00:05:44.009> was<00:05:44.190> easy<00:05:44.400> just

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
in just a second and that was easy just

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.189 
in just a second and that was easy just
remember<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.180> your<00:05:45.360> three<00:05:45.599> long<00:05:45.810> screws

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
remember that your three long screws

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.409 
remember that your three long screws
went<00:05:46.440> up<00:05:46.529> here<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:46.919> then<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.639> seven<00:05:48.120> smaller

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
went up here and then the seven smaller

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.850 
went up here and then the seven smaller
screws<00:05:48.839> go<00:05:49.050> around<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.379> rest<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.740> machine

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
screws go around the rest of the machine

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.709 
screws go around the rest of the machine
and<00:05:50.310> that's<00:05:50.550> when<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:50.759> front<00:05:51.060> hit<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.360> back

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
and that's when the front hit the back

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.899 
and that's when the front hit the back
hinge<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.259> at<00:05:52.379> the<00:05:52.469> top<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.339> screen<00:05:53.729> latch

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
hinge is at the top and the screen latch

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.209 
hinge is at the top and the screen latch
would<00:05:54.150> be<00:05:54.270> right<00:05:54.419> up<00:05:54.449> here<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:55.800> now<00:05:55.919> that<00:05:56.129> it's

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
would be right up here so now that it's

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.189 
would be right up here so now that it's
in<00:05:56.460> there<00:05:56.699> booting<00:05:57.479> it<00:05:57.629> up<00:05:57.719> at<00:05:57.870> this<00:05:57.990> point

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
in there booting it up at this point

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.390 
in there booting it up at this point
would<00:05:58.409> do<00:05:58.560> nothing<00:05:58.770> i'm<00:05:59.069> going<00:05:59.189> to<00:05:59.279> have<00:05:59.370> to

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
would do nothing i'm going to have to

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.529 
would do nothing i'm going to have to
reinstall<00:06:00.000> OS<00:06:01.400> 10.6<00:06:02.400> on<00:06:02.669> it<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:02.969> then<00:06:03.419> i'm

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
reinstall OS 10.6 on it and then i'm

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.089 
reinstall OS 10.6 on it and then i'm
going<00:06:03.659> to<00:06:03.750> be<00:06:03.810> restoring<00:06:04.259> from<00:06:04.469> a<00:06:04.589> backup<00:06:04.979> i
