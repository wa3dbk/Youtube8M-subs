to<00:01:49.479> browse<00:01:49.659> before<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.079> do<00:01:50.229> anything<00:01:50.380> else<00:01:50.950> I'm

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
to browse before I do anything else I'm

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.469 
to browse before I do anything else I'm
actually<00:01:51.250> gonna<00:01:51.460> do<00:01:51.640> my<00:01:51.790> eyebrows<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.329> probably

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
actually gonna do my eyebrows I probably

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.640 
actually gonna do my eyebrows I probably
should<00:01:52.659> have<00:01:52.689> done<00:01:52.869> those<00:01:53.049> first<00:01:53.409> but<00:01:53.619> I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
should have done those first but I

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.609 
should have done those first but I
reminded<00:01:54.040> myself<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.360> tip<00:01:55.659> but<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.170> I'm

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
reminded myself with that tip but so I'm

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.569 
reminded myself with that tip but so I'm
actually<00:01:56.740> gonna<00:01:56.979> do<00:01:57.130> them<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> little<00:01:57.430> bit

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
actually gonna do them a little bit

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.010 
actually gonna do them a little bit
stronger<00:01:57.820> than<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.149> usually<00:01:58.360> would<00:01:58.659> because<00:01:58.930> it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
stronger than I usually would because it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.460 
stronger than I usually would because it
is<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.140> nighttime<00:01:59.470> look<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.490> I'm<00:02:00.759> gonna<00:02:00.939> take

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
is a nighttime look so I'm gonna take

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.929 
is a nighttime look so I'm gonna take
benefits<00:02:02.470> browsing<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.340> one's<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.640> dark

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
benefits browsing and this one's in dark

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.780 
benefits browsing and this one's in dark
and<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.930> hard<00:02:05.140> angle<00:02:05.740> brush<00:02:06.009> as<00:02:06.220> well<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
and the hard angle brush as well and

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.849 
and the hard angle brush as well and
this<00:02:06.880> is<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> wax<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.170> powder<00:02:08.349> so<00:02:08.709> it's

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:08.859 
this is a wax and the powder so it's

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.529 
this is a wax and the powder so it's
really<00:02:08.979> great<00:02:09.159> because<00:02:09.219> it<00:02:09.729> helps<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.299> define

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
really great because it helps to define

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.720 
really great because it helps to define
as<00:02:11.200> well<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.889> structure<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.489> I'm<00:02:12.549> going

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
as well as that structure so I'm going

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.130 
as well as that structure so I'm going
to<00:02:12.790> dip

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
to dip

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.500 
to dip
in<00:02:13.470> both<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.450> to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
in both just like that then I'm going to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
in both just like that then I'm going to
start<00:02:15.780> under<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> brow<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.740> I'm<00:02:17.100> going<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
start under the brow and I'm going to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.559 
start under the brow and I'm going to
frame<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:18.060> underneath<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.350> literally

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
frame it just underneath so literally

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.620 
frame it just underneath so literally
following<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:22.020> base<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> brow<00:02:23.390> next<00:02:24.390> fill

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
following the base of the brow next fill

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.350 
following the base of the brow next fill
in<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.230> brows<00:02:25.440> slightly<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.340> too<00:02:26.670> much<00:02:26.970> but

in the brows slightly not too much but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.210 
in the brows slightly not too much but
with<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> browsing<00:02:27.930> again<00:02:28.410> using<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.950> same
