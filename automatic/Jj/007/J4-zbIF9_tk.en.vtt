could plunder those regions and then we

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.970

the moment Europe was busy with its

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
fault although nearly all of them have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.559 
fault although nearly all of them have
been<00:02:48.650> independent<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.370> 50<00:02:49.940> years<00:02:50.269> and

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
been independent for 50 years and

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.690 
been independent for 50 years and
although<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.349> Arab<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.859> African<00:02:52.069> slave

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
although the Arab and African slave

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.729 
although the Arab and African slave
trade<00:02:53.030> was<00:02:53.299> just<00:02:53.659> as<00:02:53.840> devastating<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
trade was just as devastating as the

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.160 
trade was just as devastating as the
European<00:02:55.340> one<00:02:55.579> so<00:02:56.209> Europe<00:02:56.599> decided<00:02:56.930> to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
European one so Europe decided to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.020 
European one so Europe decided to
conquer<00:02:57.409> the<00:02:57.650> world<00:02:57.920> by<00:02:58.220> manipulating<00:02:58.909> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
conquer the world by manipulating the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
conquer the world by manipulating the
time<00:02:59.299> lines<00:02:59.629> which<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.319> much<00:03:00.560> easier<00:03:00.590> way

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
time lines which is a much easier way

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.589 
time lines which is a much easier way
than<00:03:01.250> through<00:03:01.549> military<00:03:02.000> force

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
than through military force

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.080 
than through military force
so<00:03:03.079> this<00:03:03.290> anime<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.739> basically<00:03:04.280> about<00:03:04.579> Huyen

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so this anime is basically about Huyen

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.759 
so this anime is basically about Huyen
and<00:03:05.299> his<00:03:05.389> friends<00:03:05.780> fooling<00:03:06.170> around<00:03:06.500> with<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
and his friends fooling around with the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.250 
and his friends fooling around with the
time<00:03:07.040> lines<00:03:07.370> being<00:03:08.150> busy<00:03:08.629> fixing<00:03:09.109> them

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
time lines being busy fixing them

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.199 
time lines being busy fixing them
afterwards<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:10.220> trying<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.879> create<00:03:11.030> a

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
afterwards and trying to create a

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.210 
afterwards and trying to create a
timeline<00:03:11.599> in<00:03:12.109> which<00:03:12.230> Europe<00:03:12.620> doesn't<00:03:12.950> invent

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
timeline in which Europe doesn't invent

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.069 
timeline in which Europe doesn't invent
a<00:03:13.370> time<00:03:13.579> machine<00:03:13.639> and<00:03:14.090> doesn't<00:03:14.569> conquer<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
a time machine and doesn't conquer the

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:15.580 
a time machine and doesn't conquer the
world

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
world

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.339 
world
now<00:03:16.159> this<00:03:16.430> anime<00:03:16.819> was<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.269> great<00:03:17.599> it<00:03:18.170> had

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
now this anime was just great it had

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.199 
now this anime was just great it had
some<00:03:18.590> funny<00:03:18.620> moments<00:03:19.069> and<00:03:19.549> only<00:03:19.849> very<00:03:20.090> few

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
some funny moments and only very few

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.210 
some funny moments and only very few
action<00:03:20.780> scenes<00:03:21.079> but<00:03:21.349> it<00:03:21.409> still<00:03:21.709> managed<00:03:22.069> to

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
action scenes but it still managed to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.069 
action scenes but it still managed to
keep<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.519> interested<00:03:22.849> and<00:03:23.239> entertained<00:03:23.870> all

keep you interested and entertained all

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.500 
keep you interested and entertained all
the<00:03:24.200> time<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:24.980> also<00:03:25.220> romantic<00:03:26.090> quite

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the time it's also romantic quite

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.720 
the time it's also romantic quite
dramatic<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.349> sometimes<00:03:27.889> really<00:03:28.099> dark<00:03:28.549> and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
dramatic and sometimes really dark and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.909 
dramatic and sometimes really dark and
intense<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.840> characters<00:03:30.410> were<00:03:30.590> really

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
intense the characters were really

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.189 
intense the characters were really
realistic<00:03:31.819> since<00:03:32.060> they<00:03:32.209> didn't<00:03:32.510> do<00:03:32.599> a<00:03:32.629> typical

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
realistic since they didn't do a typical

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.809 
realistic since they didn't do a typical
over-the-top<00:03:33.859> stuff<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.609> other

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
over-the-top stuff you see in other

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.970 
over-the-top stuff you see in other
animes<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.599> I<00:03:35.930> also<00:03:36.109> like<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.620> animation

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
animes and I also like the animation

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.039 
animes and I also like the animation
since<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:37.730> wasn't<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.090> type<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.359> animation

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
since it wasn't a type of animation

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.750 
since it wasn't a type of animation
where<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.379> colors<00:03:39.739> are<00:03:39.919> so<00:03:40.129> bright<00:03:40.430> and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
where the colors are so bright and

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.759 
where the colors are so bright and
intense<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.419> get<00:03:41.599> an<00:03:41.720> epileptic<00:03:42.260> shock

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
intense and you get an epileptic shock

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.979 
intense and you get an epileptic shock
what<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.519> didn't<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.060> was<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.510> fact<00:03:44.900> that

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
what I didn't like was the fact that

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.740 
what I didn't like was the fact that
this<00:03:45.199> anime<00:03:45.590> starts<00:03:45.949> really<00:03:46.519> slow<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:47.480> first

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
this anime starts really slow the first

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.750 
this anime starts really slow the first
two<00:03:48.019> or<00:03:48.049> three<00:03:48.230> episodes<00:03:48.859> are<00:03:49.040> really<00:03:49.400> hard<00:03:49.609> to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
two or three episodes are really hard to

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.099 
two or three episodes are really hard to
get<00:03:49.910> through<00:03:50.120> since<00:03:50.449> you<00:03:50.540> don't<00:03:50.720> have<00:03:50.870> any

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
get through since you don't have any

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.259 
get through since you don't have any
idea<00:03:51.470> what's<00:03:51.680> going<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:52.190> from<00:03:52.819> episode<00:03:53.239> 4

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
idea what's going on from episode 4

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.869 
idea what's going on from episode 4
onwards<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:54.349> gets<00:03:54.590> much<00:03:54.859> better<00:03:55.099> but<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.579> isn't

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
onwards it gets much better but it isn't

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.640 
onwards it gets much better but it isn't
smart<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.299> make<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:56.569> first<00:03:56.840> episodes<00:03:57.440> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
smart to make the first episodes the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.129 
smart to make the first episodes the
most<00:03:57.859> confusing<00:03:58.519> at<00:03:58.639> least<00:03:58.879> interesting<00:03:59.660> and

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
most confusing at least interesting and

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.960 
most confusing at least interesting and
the<00:04:00.379> second<00:04:00.799> thing<00:04:00.919> I<00:04:01.099> didn't<00:04:01.430> like<00:04:01.639> was<00:04:01.940> the

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
the second thing I didn't like was the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.729 
the second thing I didn't like was the
fact<00:04:02.299> that<00:04:02.359> this<00:04:02.569> anime<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.049> doesn't<00:04:03.349> make<00:04:03.500> any

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
fact that this anime it doesn't make any

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.490 
fact that this anime it doesn't make any
sense<00:04:04.160> at<00:04:04.400> all<00:04:04.609> just<00:04:05.269> an<00:04:05.389> example<00:04:05.989> in<00:04:06.199> this

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
sense at all just an example in this

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.099 
sense at all just an example in this
scene<00:04:06.829> smarty<00:04:07.489> girl<00:04:07.699> uses<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.299> formula<00:04:08.959> to

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
scene smarty girl uses this formula to

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.629 
scene smarty girl uses this formula to
compensate<00:04:09.709> for<00:04:09.889> the<00:04:10.010> effect<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.519> the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
compensate for the effect of the

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.879 
compensate for the effect of the
einstein-rosen<00:04:11.359> bridge<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.349> this<00:04:12.530> formula

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
einstein-rosen bridge but this formula

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.619 
einstein-rosen bridge but this formula
is<00:04:13.099> wrong<00:04:13.430> since<00:04:13.879> it<00:04:14.000> doesn't<00:04:14.299> take<00:04:14.449> into

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
is wrong since it doesn't take into

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.569 
is wrong since it doesn't take into
account<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:15.579> einstein-podolsky-rosen

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
really good job in combining all the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.020 
really good job in combining all the
time<00:04:30.080> paradox<00:04:30.530> stuff<00:04:31.039> with<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.370> story<00:04:31.699> and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
time paradox stuff with the story and

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.060 
time paradox stuff with the story and
explaining<00:04:32.719> them<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.260> comprehensive

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070

entertaining<00:04:34.849> and<00:04:35.000> not<00:04:35.180> too<00:04:35.450> complicated<00:04:35.870> way

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
entertaining and not too complicated way

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.660 
entertaining and not too complicated way
so<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:36.770> simply<00:04:37.099> a<00:04:37.310> poor

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
so I simply a poor

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.120 
so I simply a poor
of<00:04:37.730> this<00:04:37.940> intelligence<00:04:38.600> as<00:04:39.110> for<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> rest<00:04:39.770> I'm

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
of this intelligence as for the rest I'm

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.440 
of this intelligence as for the rest I'm
willing<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.580> ignore<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.000> few<00:04:41.240> little

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
willing to ignore it a few little

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.420 
willing to ignore it a few little
mistakes<00:04:41.660> since<00:04:42.350> those<00:04:42.620> were<00:04:42.830> really<00:04:43.160> just

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
mistakes since those were really just

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.400 
mistakes since those were really just
minor<00:04:43.730> things<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.390> perfection<00:04:44.990> requires
