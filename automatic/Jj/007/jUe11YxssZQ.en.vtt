00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
there must have been an easier way so I

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.089 
there must have been an easier way so I
just<00:06:01.509> simply<00:06:01.870> made<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.080> phone<00:06:02.409> call<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.710> see

it<00:06:05.800> can<00:06:06.130> be<00:06:06.310> done<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.419> did<00:06:07.900> though<00:06:08.580> six<00:06:09.580> one

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789
