strength<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:20.660> well<00:03:22.120> here<00:03:23.120> we<00:03:23.180> go<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.840> glued

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
strength as well here we go just glued

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.170 
strength as well here we go just glued
it<00:03:24.230> together<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.940> cause<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.239> clamp<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.720> me
