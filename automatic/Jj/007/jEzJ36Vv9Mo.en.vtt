um and I think I'm gonna keep the laces
and<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.950> kind<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.430> doing<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:54.980> because

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
and I kind of like doing that because

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.410 
and I kind of like doing that because
the<00:02:57.150> until<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.569> gets<00:02:57.720> kind<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.989> boring<00:02:59.239> you<00:03:00.239> see

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the until it gets kind of boring you see

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.940 
the until it gets kind of boring you see
that<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.690> fun<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.609> mean<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:04.109> know<00:03:04.200> again<00:03:04.799> I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that for fun and I mean you know again I

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.430 
that for fun and I mean you know again I
go<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> pinky<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.000> there's<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:06.269> a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
go to in the pinky and there's like a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
go to in the pinky and there's like a
little<00:03:07.440> indent<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.129> there<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.459> my<00:03:08.549> finger<00:03:08.940> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
little indent in there for my finger I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.750 
little indent in there for my finger I
thought<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.690> was<00:03:09.780> pretty<00:03:09.900> cool<00:03:10.519> I've<00:03:11.519> seen

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
thought that was pretty cool I've seen

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.460 
thought that was pretty cool I've seen
like<00:03:11.940> people<00:03:12.269> do<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.629> put<00:03:12.659> like<00:03:12.930> butter<00:03:13.230> there

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
like people do you put like butter there

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.199 
like people do you put like butter there
or<00:03:13.590> something<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.190> they<00:03:14.400> would<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:15.030> leave

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
or something and they would you leave

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.180 
or something and they would you leave
their<00:03:15.359> finger<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.870> he<00:03:16.590> said<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:16.859> think

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
their finger in it he said I think

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.690 
their finger in it he said I think
