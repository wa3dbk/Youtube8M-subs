 day is little over a year now 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.289
 is in the process of adapting to the new 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 life 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.420
 the aquarium sao paulo for now and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.699
 how spend most of the time in this 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.340
 area of ​​the aquarium it only appears 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.440
 to the public in the morning is that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.570
 biologists are doing a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.739
 approximation with another male of the same 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 species 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.450
 thunder who is five years older and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 weighs 100 more kilos 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.610
 under always reigned absolute in this 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.920
 small but soon you will have to split 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.060
 with India so that it does not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 there are conflicts 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.820
 biologists use various resources to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.130
 that they can get used to each other 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 initially entered the recent one and begins 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 calling the other animal's name was 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.780
 to get here in Brazil the Indian is 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.549
 then sounds and puppies vocalizations of 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.659
 wolf cub from the tables of the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.970
 same species 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.939
 and with this will put a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.610
 It's a doll, then, when he lives a 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.740
 And I heard a sound then when 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 came to me or did he not 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.110
 the thunder client pool or tape on the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 mammals sector very close to the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.540
 manatee and the other the new 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.119
 attraction already arouses the curiosity of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.000
 small only they still do a lot 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.970
 confusion and identify species 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.929
 I liked him, I wanted to know what kind 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:13.050
 This cei focuses and is sure I am shocked. 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.140
 sure who 's gossip is not a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.450
 the confusion even acceptable because 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.480
 it is very similar to a seal such as 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.720
 difference that seals do not move with 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.600
 the four limbs out of the water are the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.660
 sea lions already have sea lions 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.580
 this ability and finally the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.130
 offered sea ​​lion manipulates the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.430
 Sea lion is size is one 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.209
 Male sea ​​lion reaches 300 kg and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.209
