pitch now in this in this short video
what<00:00:18.690> would<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> talk<00:00:19.080> about<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.590> strike

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
what would a talk about is you strike

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859 
what would a talk about is you strike
your<00:00:19.890> starting<00:00:20.400> positions<00:00:20.820> where<00:00:21.630> they

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
your starting positions where they

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
your starting positions where they
should<00:00:22.050> put<00:00:22.800> pressure<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> ball

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
should put pressure on the ball

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
should put pressure on the ball
so<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.240> analyst<00:00:24.779> away<00:00:25.050> explodes<00:00:25.439> down<00:00:25.650> their

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
so when analyst away explodes down their

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.970 
so when analyst away explodes down their
body<00:00:26.550> positioning<00:00:27.210> when<00:00:27.390> closing<00:00:27.980> we're

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
body positioning when closing we're

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
body positioning when closing we're
going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.160> look<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.090> win<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> ball<00:00:30.599> as

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
going to look at can we win the ball as

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.690 
going to look at can we win the ball as
well<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> dilemma

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
well so you know there is a dilemma

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.370 
well so you know there is a dilemma
there<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.149> they<00:00:33.270> go<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.540> they<00:00:33.630> close<00:00:33.840> down<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
there if they go and they close down is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.639 
there if they go and they close down is
can<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:34.770> win<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> ball<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.640> also<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.620> late<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
can they win the ball and also in late a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.930 
can they win the ball and also in late a
bit<00:00:37.800> we're<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> talk<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.610> how<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
bit we're going to talk about how you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
bit we're going to talk about how you
can<00:00:39.149> add<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.930> midfielders<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.590> also

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can add then some midfielders and also

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
can add then some midfielders and also
defenders<00:00:41.309> into<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.850> well<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> key

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
defenders into this as well so the key

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
defenders into this as well so the key
thing<00:00:42.960> clearly<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> played<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
thing clearly is that we played in a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
thing clearly is that we played in a
formation<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.510> fall<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.440> two

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
formation here fall for two with two

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
formation here fall for two with two
straight<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.160> front<00:00:47.399> aren't<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.030> right

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
straight up front aren't we that's right

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
straight up front aren't we that's right
so<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.570> talked<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:49.129> we're<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

the<00:01:01.559> main<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.100> main<00:01:02.129> point<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:02.969> say<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the main the main point I would say is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
the main the main point I would say is
for<00:01:03.629> our<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:03.960> fours<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.729> want

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
for our two fours we want them we want

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.100 
for our two fours we want them we want
to<00:01:06.030> encourage<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> ball<00:01:06.600> team<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> throw<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to encourage the ball team to throw the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010 
to encourage the ball team to throw the
football<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:08.330> what<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.900> even

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
football out now what we don't have even

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
football out now what we don't have even
going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.470> too<00:01:10.619> deep<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.430> they

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
going to be too deep because they

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
going to be too deep because they
normally<00:01:12.000> will<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.299> he<00:01:12.689> will<00:01:12.720> incur<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
normally will do he will incur will just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.170 
normally will do he will incur will just
throw<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> ball<00:01:14.250> trailing<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> back<00:01:14.760> four<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
throw the ball trailing the back four so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
throw the ball trailing the back four so
we<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.049> them<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> throw<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
we really want them to throw out to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
we really want them to throw out to
either<00:01:16.920> fall<00:01:17.220> back<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> little

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
either fall back so if we put a little

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.859 
either fall back so if we put a little
bit<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> pressure<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.659> will

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
bit of pressure on then it will

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.270 
bit of pressure on then it will
encourage<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.380> old<00:01:22.560> people<00:01:22.799> side<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> throw<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
encourage an old people side to throw it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
encourage an old people side to throw it
to<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> fallback<00:01:23.970> all<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.570> fall<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:24.990> now

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
to that fallback all that fall back now

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
to that fallback all that fall back now
the<00:01:25.710> problem<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.060> bit<00:01:27.210> too

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the problem is if we go a little bit too

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
the problem is if we go a little bit too
further<00:01:27.780> forward<00:01:28.350> another<00:01:28.979> three<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.340> four

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
further forward another three or four

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
further forward another three or four
yards<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> gold<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.320> will

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
yards then all the gold people do will

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
yards then all the gold people do will
end<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.650> kicking<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.579> you'll<00:01:32.759> probably<00:01:32.970> win

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
end up kicking it or you'll probably win

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.420 
end up kicking it or you'll probably win
the<00:01:33.360> ball<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.869> you've<00:01:34.500> got<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:34.799> defenders<00:01:35.280> in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the ball if you've got good defenders in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.940 
the ball if you've got good defenders in
this<00:01:35.970> area<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.200> really<00:01:37.530> defeating

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this area here so it's really defeating

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
this area here so it's really defeating
the<00:01:38.040> object<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.210> -<00:01:39.450> pitch<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the object we like all this - pitch as

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.710 
the object we like all this - pitch as
possible<00:01:40.380> okay<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.610> K<00:01:41.880> -<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.540> where

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
possible okay so that's K - to where

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.399 
possible okay so that's K - to where
they<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:42.869> be

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
they should be

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.960 
they should be
so<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> key<00:01:43.950> thing<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.759> too

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so the key thing there is not to be too

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.139 
so the key thing there is not to be too
advanced<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> alive<00:01:47.250> until<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.939> knock

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
advanced and and alive until I can knock

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.719 
advanced and and alive until I can knock
it<00:01:48.180> long<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.130> touch<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it long but also to be in touch with it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.789 
it long but also to be in touch with it
with<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> two<00:01:51.180> cents<00:01:51.450> off<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.439> wants<00:01:52.710> to

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
when we can obviously talk about that

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.750 
when we can obviously talk about that
later<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.569> but<00:03:05.870> he<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.650> key<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.250> stop<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
later on but he is key now to stop the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.199 
later on but he is key now to stop the
ball

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
ball

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.330 
ball

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
maybe being fed into a midfielder so

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.129 
maybe being fed into a midfielder so

there at least you're talking about is

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.849 
there at least you're talking about is
is<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:38.000> movement<00:03:38.569> there<00:03:39.019> in<00:03:39.410> terms<00:03:39.680> of

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
is that that movement there in terms of

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.250 
is that that movement there in terms of
cutting<00:03:40.069> causing<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.180> line<00:03:41.420> off<00:03:41.630> as<00:03:41.810> well<00:03:42.019> so

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
cutting causing that line off as well so

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.599 
cutting causing that line off as well so
I<00:03:42.319> play<00:03:42.500> your<00:03:42.769> inter<00:03:43.040> mid<00:03:43.190> field

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
I play your inter mid field

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.640 
I play your inter mid field
maybe<00:03:44.180> one<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.569> their<00:03:44.690> midfielders<00:03:45.200> just<00:03:45.440> drop

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
maybe one of their midfielders just drop

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.340 
maybe one of their midfielders just drop
in<00:03:45.829> future<00:03:46.329> speak<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.480> ball<00:03:47.660> yeah<00:03:48.170> because

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
in future speak the ball yeah because

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.380 
in future speak the ball yeah because
now<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.620> should

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
now you should

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.570 
now you should
doing<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.960> or<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.560> sends<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.830> half<00:03:50.980> over<00:03:51.370> to

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
doing that or the sends a half over to

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.120 
doing that or the sends a half over to
the<00:03:51.700> job<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.030> Mithila<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:52.690> well<00:03:52.870> terrific<00:03:53.440> okay

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
the job of Mithila as well terrific okay

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.190 
the job of Mithila as well terrific okay
so<00:03:54.760> if<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.150> think<00:03:55.420> about<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.870> we've<00:03:56.080> looked

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
so if you think about that we've looked

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.840 
so if you think about that we've looked
at<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.440> starting<00:03:56.800> position<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.310> strikers

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
at the starting position of the strikers

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.820 
at the starting position of the strikers
so<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.330> want<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.600> about<00:03:58.750> ten<00:03:59.080> yards<00:03:59.500> off

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
so you want to be about ten yards off

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.830 
so you want to be about ten yards off
the<00:03:59.890> center<00:04:00.819> off<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.209> try<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.480> make<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.660> play

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
the center off to try and make the play

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.630 
the center off to try and make the play
predictable<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.770> goal<00:04:02.950> people<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.520> has

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
predictable so the goal people that has

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.430 
predictable so the goal people that has
either<00:04:03.760> got<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.060> kick<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.720> longer<00:04:05.200> than<00:04:05.350> we

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
either got to kick it longer than we

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.320 
either got to kick it longer than we
challenging<00:04:05.980> them<00:04:06.130> in<00:04:06.340> our<00:04:06.580> defensive<00:04:07.120> third

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
challenging them in our defensive third

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.060 
challenging them in our defensive third
but<00:04:07.660> what<00:04:08.080> we<00:04:08.200> want<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.380> try<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.680> do<00:04:08.740> is<00:04:08.830> win<00:04:08.980> it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
but what we want to try and do is win it

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.460 
but what we want to try and do is win it
is<00:04:09.160> have<00:04:09.340> pitch<00:04:10.030> as<00:04:10.180> possible<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:10.750> if<00:04:10.990> we<00:04:11.320> make

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
is have pitch as possible so if we make

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.960 
is have pitch as possible so if we make
the<00:04:11.560> play<00:04:11.740> predictable<00:04:12.280> get<00:04:12.490> it<00:04:12.580> out<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.880> the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
the play predictable get it out to the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.730 
the play predictable get it out to the
fallback<00:04:13.209> then<00:04:13.990> what<00:04:14.110> we<00:04:14.200> do<00:04:14.350> is<00:04:14.410> we<00:04:14.530> put

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
fallback then what we do is we put

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.800 
fallback then what we do is we put
pressure<00:04:14.920> on<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.670> ball<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.180> as<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.630> ball

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
pressure on the ball so as the ball

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.289 
pressure on the ball so as the ball
travels<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:17.980> does<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.340> first<00:04:18.549> strike<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.180> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
travels so does that first strike it and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.550 
travels so does that first strike it and
that<00:04:19.419> triggers<00:04:19.810> as<00:04:19.989> soon<00:04:20.140> as<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.320> leaves<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that triggers as soon as it leaves the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.840 
that triggers as soon as it leaves the
goalies<00:04:20.919> hands<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.310> it's<00:04:21.400> rolling<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.820> out

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
goalies hands and it's rolling it out

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.540 
goalies hands and it's rolling it out
there<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.419> strike<00:04:23.080> has<00:04:23.350> got<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.710> make<00:04:23.890> that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
there that strike has got to make that

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.670 
there that strike has got to make that
are<00:04:24.820> ones<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.330> time<00:04:25.540> for<00:04:25.750> crashing<00:04:26.140> on<00:04:26.230> keep
