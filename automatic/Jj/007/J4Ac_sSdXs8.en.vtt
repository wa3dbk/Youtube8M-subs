 if he reads he has finally reached the city 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.930
 of the gym but the question is where 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.470
 There is the gym 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.110

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.900

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.200
 sure with my pokemon or to achieve 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.200
 win 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.839

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.839
 big on the inside that on the outside 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.750
 you are the leader of the gym 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.140
 that's right and I suppose you are a 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.780
 coach who comes to challenge me if 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.260
 I want to have my battle now as 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.260

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.440
 guided well I would choose teilón I am 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.660
 sure that tale out has a great 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.060
 advantage in speed so youtube does not 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.890
 you can catch it fast peck hahahaha 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.610
 james woods uses rock tomb and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.610
 crushed 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.189
 but what happened to you not know that 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.420
 Flying types are weak to types 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.610

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.850
 now I will use my new pokémon 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.990
 motive I will use my pokédex maybe that's 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.020
 help 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.060
 the youtube rock pokemon has a 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.649
 incredible defensive power that makes it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.560
 usually resistant to any 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.899
 physical attack if the physical attacks do not 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.049
 they are very effective maybe you should try 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.049
 with something non-physical mochis water jet 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:00.320
 I do not work excellent reason that only 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.520
 it was a kind of beginner let's go my 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.520
 second plane 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.299
 sour water stream 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.310
 rays not again well I admit that you should 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.640
 to be good novice to have beaten 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.969
 my first two pokemon but not many 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.980
 they manage to beat my strongest pokemon 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:51.430
 I'm ready for any challenge is not 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.850
 so why then we will see we will not 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.990
 I will pass 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.990
 but what is that 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.990
 who is that Pokemon 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.480

 the country the pokemon triumph the nous pas 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.550
 has a nose that works like a 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.069
 electro magnet and determines the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.160
 application when you move your nerves 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.350
 it's good to know this information now I know 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.720
 what should I do nose peace can not attack 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.690
 if you can not see motives to slap the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.060
 fast fort auto 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.400
 you can keep trying to lower the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.880
 accuracy of my nose happens but you do not 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.310
 It will avail us we're going to finish 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.390

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.140
 excellent battle good this leaves us 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.920
 one by one 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.860
 I hope you're ready rich I'll 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.480
 I choose so trico and interesting option 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.370
 I do not know what attack will do much damage to 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.240
 that news pass but let's start with 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.300
 Rich speed uses fast attack that does not 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.510
 he did not tickle my nose pass 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.490

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.670

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.670
 pass 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.560
 you did some damage but 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.800
 you will need more than that if you want 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.580
 beat it then we can achieve it trico and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.849
 I'll see 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.969
 rico usa absorb again in knows pass 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:39.169
 that did more damage to him than the last 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:41.479
 time is not a rock grave 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.729
 make happy for having weakened a 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.309
 little friends more because before the 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.929

 position will heal your wounds 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.840
 it seems that this fight will be longer 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.840
 than expected 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.260

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.600
 fast absorber 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.060

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.900
