00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 i watch gti pierre paganini tried and gerard gorisse collected his 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.319
 impressions 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.439
 it was time that we have all the other paid games france new 205 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 is sold for 190 kilometers hour this top speed the place very 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.679
 well in front of other small European sporting fractions it's a little less 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.359
 quick 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.429
 that the vuelta turbo the artsite me everywhere golf gti 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.899
 but it's obvious that the youngest I was happy the scan x r3 mersen 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.110
 some turbo 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.190
 yet the 205 meters that 105 horses I believe that every day did not shoot 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 everything we could from the injection engine but at 205 to other assets 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.090
 it is light the 150 kilos 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.370
 and weight is as important as power for performance 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.730
 on the kilometer start stopped after thirty-one seconds this is the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.840
 same time as the old golf gti 16 cents 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.780
 I was hoping better 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.629
 the new Peugeot but noticeably 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.629
 cheaper than the good 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.050
 the first thing I actually noticed is the break 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 we find that it's very important in a sports car 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.550
 and with the seedling of welcome that equips the 205 gti 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.010
 we are very well maintained laterally and that is very important if we want 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.360
 grow up sportily 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.090
 the engine if we compare it to our engine is obviously that of the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.980
 east coast of the country that serves as a reference for all these cars 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.360
 they are comparable but I would say that the new Peugeot is a little bit 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.510
 softer more progressive less violent than golf 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 it is both a quality and a defect 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.630
 a sports staging of mans regards 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.880
 the three reports provided when one leads for example very quickly in 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.550
 Mountain 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.720
 2nd 3rd and 4th test three reports perfectly staged 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.220
 the 205 in my opinion the front traction the less sure 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.360
 we arrive at his wheel 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.799
 not to mention even that it's a pull I'm talking about 150 general 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.549
 and there I was a fact no exception 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.409
 it is necessary to roll on the wet it is what happened by the pc 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.419
 to get to find understeer and again it's incredibly limited 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.829
 I think we can say a big congratulations a peugeot technician for the train 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:23.519
 before 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.019
 not you a pleasure I had fun to make her survive she makes cement 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.270
 for check patted in the car 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.579
 we must only avoid 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.799
 to counter-point because the direction in a lot of reminder as often on the 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.499
 little luck she immediately returns to understeer altogether I would say that the 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.269
 bigger pic very effective with a lot of motor skills 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.870
 a very great maneuverability 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 and exceptional braking thanks to a great job
