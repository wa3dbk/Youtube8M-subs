always<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> way<00:00:26.699> afterwards<00:00:27.199> what<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> have

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
always in the way afterwards what I have

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.860 
always in the way afterwards what I have
to<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:29.750> find<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> means<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.369> storing<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
to have now find the means of storing it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.709 
to have now find the means of storing it
quite<00:00:33.870> immediately<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.680> gonna<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.100> himself

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.869 

so<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:40.620> I've<00:00:40.829> done<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.280> replicate<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so all I've done is to replicate the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
so all I've done is to replicate the
existing<00:00:42.390> bracket<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.440> used<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> mount<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
existing bracket here used to mount the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.959 
existing bracket here used to mount the
fence<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:44.940> using<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> planer<00:00:46.820> made<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
fence when using the planer made that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.529 
fence when using the planer made that
again<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> wood<00:00:49.879> if<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.120> had<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> money<00:00:51.329> i

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
again out of wood if you had the money i

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.700 
again out of wood if you had the money i
suppose<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.079> where<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> cost<00:00:52.530> me<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
suppose and then where it cost me you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.220 
suppose and then where it cost me you
could<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.039> buy<00:00:53.190> another<00:00:53.219> nice<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.789> guess

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
could just buy another nice I guess

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.400 
could just buy another nice I guess
assuming<00:00:55.230> they're<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> stock<00:00:57.320> didn't<00:00:58.320> take

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
assuming they're in stock didn't take

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
assuming they're in stock didn't take
long<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:58.859> though<00:00:59.149> it's<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.210> made<00:01:00.390> from

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
long to make though it's all made from

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.970 
long to make though it's all made from
scrap<00:01:00.840> wood<00:01:01.020> couple<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> bevels<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
scrap wood couple of bevels there to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.210 
scrap wood couple of bevels there to
hold<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.399> fence<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> place<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.100> just

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hold the fence in place and just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500 
hold the fence in place and just
bolt-ons<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> inside<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> couple<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
bolt-ons the inside with a couple of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
bolt-ons the inside with a couple of
nuts<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> lock<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:07.950> place<00:01:08.150> it's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
nuts on there to lock it in place it's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
nuts on there to lock it in place it's
the<00:01:09.240> only<00:01:09.270> thin<00:01:09.630> sheet<00:01:09.960> steel<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.680> very

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the only thin sheet steel so it's very

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.660 
the only thin sheet steel so it's very
easy<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.939> drill<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> you'll<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.340> sure<00:01:14.490> your

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
easy to drill and you'll make sure your

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.300 
easy to drill and you'll make sure your
bolts<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.060> stick<00:01:15.330> through<00:01:15.570> too<00:01:15.810> far

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
bolts don't stick through too far

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.200 
bolts don't stick through too far
obviously<00:01:17.310> may<00:01:17.430> interfere<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> gears

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
obviously may interfere with the gears

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
obviously may interfere with the gears
and<00:01:18.420> pulleys<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> things<00:01:19.189> once<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> new

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and pulleys and things once a new

bracket<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.909> screwed<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.270> place<00:01:21.920> you'll<00:01:22.920> find

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bracket is screwed in place you'll find

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
bracket is screwed in place you'll find
you<00:01:23.220> over<00:01:23.310> convenient<00:01:24.380> space<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
you over convenient space in which that

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.480 
you over convenient space in which that
final<00:01:27.150> offense<00:01:27.390> mitts<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.750> required<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.789 

just<00:01:32.490> drops<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> place<00:01:33.590> what<00:01:34.590> other

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
just drops in place what other

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
just drops in place what other
advantages<00:01:35.280> did<00:01:35.460> happen<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.880> fence<00:01:36.150> inside

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
advantages did happen your fence inside

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
advantages did happen your fence inside
the<00:01:36.659> plane<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.610> somewhere

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the plane like this so we have somewhere

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.149 
the plane like this so we have somewhere
to<00:01:39.320> battle<00:01:40.320> opponents<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> machine

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
to battle opponents as a machine

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
to battle opponents as a machine
anything<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.149> write<00:01:45.149> reports<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.689> not

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
anything like so write reports are not

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.010 
anything like so write reports are not
too<00:01:46.049> long<00:01:46.259> too<00:01:46.590> wide<00:01:47.210> give<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> small<00:01:48.780> job

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
too long too wide give you a small job

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.149 
too long too wide give you a small job
is<00:01:49.200> small<00:01:49.439> component

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is small component

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.880

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
maybe narrow pieces short lengths it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.489 
maybe narrow pieces short lengths it
could<00:01:53.069> be<00:01:53.159> quite<00:01:53.369> useful<00:01:54.140> on<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.350> machines

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
could be quite useful on some machines

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.380 
could be quite useful on some machines
you<00:01:55.799> are<00:01:55.890> fortunate<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.429> that<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.819> fence

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you are fortunate in that the fence

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
you are fortunate in that the fence
wings<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> table<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.009> not

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wings up with the table so it's not

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.580 
wings up with the table so it's not
applicable<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.929> but<00:02:00.929> regardless<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.439> hope

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
applicable to that but regardless I hope
