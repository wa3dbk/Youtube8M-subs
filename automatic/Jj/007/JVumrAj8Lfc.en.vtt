00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the shanghai a map so hopefully this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
the shanghai a map so hopefully this
will<00:00:44.340> mean<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:45.480> will<00:00:45.660> completely<00:00:45.930> change

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
will mean that it will completely change

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
will mean that it will completely change
with<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> whole<00:00:46.829> game<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.160> played<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
with a whole game is played just the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
with a whole game is played just the
waves<00:00:48.420> themselves<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.890> how

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
waves themselves you can see like how

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
waves themselves you can see like how
high<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> waves<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> let<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> players

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
high the waves are and let the players

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
high the waves are and let the players
like<00:00:51.840> bobbing<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> should

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
like bobbing up and down so that should

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
like bobbing up and down so that should
hopefully<00:00:53.670> change<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.539> you'll<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.170> able<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
hopefully change like you'll be able to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799

tactics as you guys may have noticed

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
tactics as you guys may have noticed
because<00:01:13.790> previously<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.240> sort<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
because previously they just sort of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.240 
because previously they just sort of
like<00:01:15.720> give<00:01:16.229> us<00:01:16.380> hints<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.070> there

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.649 
like give us hints as to what there
would<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:17.850> they've<00:01:18.030> got<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.270> name

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
would be but now they've got our name

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
would be but now they've got our name
them<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.020> Sean<00:01:19.229> cook<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.189> when

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
them and Sean cook from all of them when

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
them and Sean cook from all of them when
whereas<00:01:21.150> previously<00:01:21.600> obviously<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.140> sure

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
whereas previously obviously they sure

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
whereas previously obviously they sure
like<00:01:22.590> maybe<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> first<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> then

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
like maybe the first two and then

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
like maybe the first two and then
obviously<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.720> showed<00:01:24.960> end<00:01:25.229> game<00:01:25.439> off<00:01:25.650> last

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
obviously they showed end game off last

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.770 
obviously they showed end game off last
which<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.850> didn't<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.090> anything<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.420> what

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
which we didn't know anything about what

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
which we didn't know anything about what
now<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> seems<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.680> being<00:01:28.829> given<00:01:29.040> a
