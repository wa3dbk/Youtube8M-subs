00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
to StarCraft II maybe you just now got

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980 
to StarCraft II maybe you just now got
the<00:00:14.309> game<00:00:14.519> maybe<00:00:15.299> actually<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.900> completed

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the game maybe actually just completed

the single-player and maybe you've
messed<00:00:17.850> around<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> races<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> little

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
messed around with the races a little

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.390 
messed around with the races a little
bit<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.650> you're<00:00:19.800> actually<00:00:19.859> ready<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
bit but now you're actually ready to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.099 
bit but now you're actually ready to
take<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> another<00:00:20.970> step<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> thing

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
take it to another step see the thing

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.420 
take it to another step see the thing
about<00:00:22.140> build<00:00:22.560> orders<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> actually

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
about build orders is that it actually

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.790 
about build orders is that it actually
allows<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.630> basically<00:00:24.779> combine<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> whole

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
allows you to basically combine a whole

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.230 
allows you to basically combine a whole
lot<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> knowledge<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> whole<00:00:26.789> lot<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> pro

gamers the squeeze it all together and
go<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> best<00:00:30.119> timing<00:00:30.449> attack<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
go for the best timing attack that you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.900 
go for the best timing attack that you
can<00:00:31.320> possibly<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
can possibly go for now if you

can possibly go for now if you
completely<00:00:33.390> new<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> StarCraft<00:00:34.079> II<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> might

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
completely new to StarCraft II you might

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.750 
completely new to StarCraft II you might
be<00:00:34.530> wondering<00:00:34.710> how<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> timing<00:00:35.700> attack

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
be wondering how what is a timing attack

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.370 
be wondering how what is a timing attack
what<00:00:36.059> timing<00:00:36.300> attack<00:00:36.630> means<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.230> you're

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
what timing attack means that you're

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.540 
what timing attack means that you're
trying<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> push<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.399> your

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
trying to push out first as your

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.940 
trying to push out first as your
opponent<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.120> soon<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.050> or<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.260> upgrades

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
opponent as soon as one or more upgrades

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.350 
opponent as soon as one or more upgrades
finish<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.000> could<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.329> example

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
finish you know that could for example

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
finish you know that could for example
be<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.050> whenever<00:00:43.350> +1<00:00:43.860> attack<00:00:43.950> finishes<00:00:44.489> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
be like whenever +1 attack finishes or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
be like whenever +1 attack finishes or
maybe<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:45.660> stargates

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
maybe when you have like two stargates

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
maybe when you have like two stargates
out<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> line<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.129> perfectly<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
out and you line them up perfectly to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.279 
out and you line them up perfectly to
make<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.059> three<00:00:48.300> four<00:00:48.510> dre's<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
make like three four dre's go out to the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.779 
make like three four dre's go out to the
perfect<00:00:49.590> time<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.460> sort<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
perfect time you know that sort of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
perfect time you know that sort of
attacks<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.300> usually<00:00:51.719> referred<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.320> a

going to explain you a very very basic

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.369 
going to explain you a very very basic
attack<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.059> called<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.570> four<00:00:57.870> gate<00:00:58.079> now

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
attack that is called the four gate now

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.540 
attack that is called the four gate now
the<00:00:58.440> build<00:00:58.680> order<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> be

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the build order that I'm going to be

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
the build order that I'm going to be
discussing<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.300> video<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> these

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
discussing in this video is one of these

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
discussing in this video is one of these
timing<00:01:02.160> attacks<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.609> you're<00:01:02.910> wondering

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
timing attacks now you're wondering

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.609 
timing attacks now you're wondering
where<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.539> he<00:01:03.629> talking<00:01:03.989> attacking<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.439> while

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
where is he talking attacking this while

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
where is he talking attacking this while
you<00:01:04.769> make<00:01:04.890> four<00:01:05.189> gateways<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.360> sure

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you make four gateways you make sure

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
you make four gateways you make sure
that<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.960> working<00:01:07.409> upgrade<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:07.950> allows

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that the working upgrade which allows

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
that the working upgrade which allows
you<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> transfer<00:01:09.060> those<00:01:09.210> four<00:01:09.600> gateways<00:01:10.049> into

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you to transfer those four gateways into

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
you to transfer those four gateways into
warp<00:01:10.619> gates<00:01:10.860> finishes<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> exact<00:01:12.270> same

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
warp gates finishes up at the exact same

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
warp gates finishes up at the exact same
time<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.500> warp<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.070> units

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
time so you can actually warp in units

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
time so you can actually warp in units
all<00:01:14.549> over<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.150> map<00:01:15.360> right<00:01:15.900> away<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.380> soon<00:01:16.409> as

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
all over the map right away as soon as

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
all over the map right away as soon as
you<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> proxy<00:01:17.340> pile<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> probably

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you have a proxy pile this is probably

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.390 
you have a proxy pile this is probably
considered<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.020> most<00:01:19.259> easy<00:01:19.560> aggressive

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
considered the most easy aggressive

straight<00:01:38.610> into<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> game<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.509> show

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
straight into the game and I will show

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.719 
straight into the game and I will show
you<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> four<00:01:40.860> gate<00:01:41.040> versus<00:01:41.549> any

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you how do you do a four gate versus any

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
you how do you do a four gate versus any
kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.060> opponent<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.600> StarCraft<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> heart

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
kind of opponent in StarCraft you heart

kind of opponent in StarCraft you heart
of<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> game

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of this one so here we are in the game

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.730 
of this one so here we are in the game
now<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> show<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> most<00:01:46.470> basic

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
now I'm going to show you the most basic

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
now I'm going to show you the most basic
variant<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> four<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.000> I'm<00:01:48.149> aware

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
variant of the four game I'm aware

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
variant of the four game I'm aware
that's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> billion<00:01:48.960> different<00:01:49.470> version<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that's a billion different version of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
that's a billion different version of
it's<00:01:50.040> pretty<00:01:50.220> much<00:01:50.430> some<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.210> use<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's pretty much some of them use a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
it's pretty much some of them use a
mothership<00:01:51.899> core<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.770> second

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
mothership core some of them use second

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
mothership core some of them use second
gases<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.880> add<00:01:54.030> blink<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.540> old<00:01:54.720> up

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
gases you can add blink you can old up

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
gases you can add blink you can old up
you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:56.100> kinds<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.430> fancy<00:01:56.610> stuff

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you know just all kinds of fancy stuff

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
you know just all kinds of fancy stuff
but<00:01:57.090> honestly<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> show<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.469> the

but honestly I'm going to show you the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.859 
but honestly I'm going to show you the
most<00:01:58.860> basic<00:01:59.430> version<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.299> means<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.719> we're

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
most basic version this means that we're

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.469 
most basic version this means that we're
gonna<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.170> mostly<00:02:01.680> stalkers<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.219> zones<00:02:02.549> now

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
gonna make mostly stalkers and zones now

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.300 
gonna make mostly stalkers and zones now
the<00:02:03.540> first<00:02:03.960> building<00:02:04.320> will<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> pylon<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the first building will be a pylon and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.590 
the first building will be a pylon and
we're<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> throw<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.000> down<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
we're going to throw that down at the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.180 
we're going to throw that down at the
ninth<00:02:06.899> supply<00:02:07.290> mark<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.129> at

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
ninth supply mark if you take a look at

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
ninth supply mark if you take a look at
the<00:02:08.280> top<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.849> corner<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> screen<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the top right corner of the screen you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.570 
the top right corner of the screen you
can<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.530> nine<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.009> ten<00:02:11.220> supply

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
can see it's nine out of ten supply

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.440 
can see it's nine out of ten supply
which<00:02:12.030> means<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.450> gonna<00:02:12.540> probe

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
which means that I'm gonna probe

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.790 
which means that I'm gonna probe
the<00:02:13.599> mineral<00:02:13.930> line<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.290> I'm<00:02:14.349> going<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.560> make<00:02:14.770> a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the mineral line and I'm going to make a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.740 
the mineral line and I'm going to make a
polymer<00:02:15.069> right<00:02:15.370> there<00:02:15.520> at<00:02:15.670> nine<00:02:15.879> supply<00:02:16.239> while

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
polymer right there at nine supply while

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.660 
polymer right there at nine supply while
constantly<00:02:17.230> producing<00:02:17.830> probes<00:02:18.069> now<00:02:18.550> we're

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
constantly producing probes now we're

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.520 
constantly producing probes now we're
going<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.879> try<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.269> hit<00:02:19.420> around<00:02:19.569> 16<00:02:20.140> probes<00:02:20.379> on

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
going to try and hit around 16 probes on

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.589 
going to try and hit around 16 probes on
minerals<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.069> three<00:02:21.580> probes<00:02:21.879> on<00:02:22.060> gas<00:02:22.239> because

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
minerals and three probes on gas because

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.930 
minerals and three probes on gas because
that<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.900> ideal<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.459> perfectly

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
that is ideal to do this perfectly

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940 
that is ideal to do this perfectly
however<00:02:25.239> we<00:02:25.599> will<00:02:25.720> need<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.140> make<00:02:26.470> sure<00:02:26.739> we

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
however we will need to make sure we

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
however we will need to make sure we
spend<00:02:27.220> our<00:02:27.340> chrono<00:02:27.610> boost<00:02:27.819> properly<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.750> we're

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
spend our chrono boost properly so we're

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.270 
spend our chrono boost properly so we're
going<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> spend<00:02:29.200> our<00:02:29.379> first<00:02:29.620> chrono<00:02:29.950> booster

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
going to spend our first chrono booster

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.309 
going to spend our first chrono booster
right<00:02:30.519> when<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.849> panel<00:02:31.239> finishes<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.870> hit

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
right when this panel finishes and hit

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
do it on the nexus to boost out those

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.150 
do it on the nexus to boost out those
probes<00:02:34.660> now<00:02:35.080> we're<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.410> only<00:02:35.800> do<00:02:36.099> a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
probes now we're going to only do a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.280 
probes now we're going to only do a
chrono<00:02:36.459> boost<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.060> main<00:02:37.239> nexus<00:02:37.720> twice

chrono boost on the main nexus twice
after<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.040> spend<00:02:39.310> everything<00:02:39.790> else<00:02:39.970> only

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
after that we spend everything else only

line<00:02:44.980> once<00:02:45.220> more<00:02:45.430> I'm<00:02:45.549> pulling<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.000> little

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
line once more I'm pulling it a little

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.089 
line once more I'm pulling it a little
bit<00:02:46.299> early<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.989> make<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> gateway<00:02:47.590> right<00:02:47.890> there

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
bit early to make a gateway right there

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.180 
bit early to make a gateway right there
after<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:50.140> I'm<00:02:50.410> going<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.620> use<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:50.920> same

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
after that I'm going to use this same

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.640 
after that I'm going to use this same
probe<00:02:51.489> for<00:02:51.819> scouting<00:02:52.060> purposes<00:02:52.630> right<00:02:53.500> now

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
probe for scouting purposes right now

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.440 
probe for scouting purposes right now
I'm<00:02:53.829> going<00:02:54.130> back<00:02:54.340> into<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.819> pro<00:02:54.970> production

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
I'm going back into the pro production

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.670 
I'm going back into the pro production
and<00:02:55.569> I'm<00:02:55.630> going<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.840> use<00:02:55.959> my<00:02:56.140> second<00:02:56.470> chrono

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
and I'm going to use my second chrono

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.289 
and I'm going to use my second chrono
boost<00:02:56.890> right<00:02:57.160> as<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> start<00:02:57.670> probe<00:02:57.849> production

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
boost right as a start probe production

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.940 
boost right as a start probe production
once<00:02:58.480> more<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.319> is<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> very<00:02:59.769> last

actually not playing person upon right

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.000 
actually not playing person upon right
now<00:03:37.329> it's<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.600> for<00:03:37.900> educational<00:03:38.139> purposes

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
now it's just for educational purposes

now it's just for educational purposes
but<00:03:39.579> right<00:03:39.819> where<00:03:40.000> my<00:03:40.090> gateway<00:03:40.420> finishes<00:03:40.840> I'm

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
but right where my gateway finishes I'm

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.840 
but right where my gateway finishes I'm
gonna<00:03:41.170> put<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.410> cybernetics<00:03:42.100> core<00:03:42.220> right<00:03:42.519> next

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
gonna put a cybernetics core right next

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.099 
gonna put a cybernetics core right next
to<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.329> I'm<00:03:43.450> going<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.660> stop<00:03:43.900> pro

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
to it and I'm going to stop pro

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.199 
to it and I'm going to stop pro
production<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.709> second<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.489> start<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.940> zone

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
production for a second to start a zone

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.210 
production for a second to start a zone
so<00:03:46.810> right<00:03:47.049> when<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.319> Gateway<00:03:47.590> finishes<00:03:48.040> what

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
so right when the Gateway finishes what

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.069 
so right when the Gateway finishes what
you<00:03:48.370> do<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:48.670> start<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:49.090> cybernetics<00:03:49.720> core<00:03:49.900> as

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
you do is start a cybernetics core as

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.289 
you do is start a cybernetics core as
well<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.769> zealot<00:03:50.980> before<00:03:51.670> going<00:03:51.940> back<00:03:52.120> into

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
well as a zealot before going back into

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.849 
well as a zealot before going back into
pro<00:03:52.540> production<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.170> now<00:03:53.319> I<00:03:53.350> start<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:53.829> our

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
pro production and now I start for our

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.830 
pro production and now I start for our
production<00:03:54.310> once<00:03:54.579> more<00:03:54.819> now<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.269> appropriate

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
production once more now the appropriate

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.479 
production once more now the appropriate
level<00:03:56.079> scouting<00:03:56.500> with<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.769> actually<00:03:57.099> safely

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
level scouting with is actually safely

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.400 
level scouting with is actually safely
hiding<00:03:57.940> around<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> third<00:03:58.870> base<00:03:59.109> of<00:03:59.290> my

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
hiding around the third base of my

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.809 
hiding around the third base of my
opponent<00:03:59.829> and<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.099> one<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.340> actually<00:04:00.670> very

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
opponent and that one is actually very

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.940 
opponent and that one is actually very
important<00:04:01.450> because<00:04:01.540> later<00:04:02.170> I'm<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.709> use

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
important because later I'm going to use

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.039 
important because later I'm going to use
that<00:04:03.130> probe<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.489> make<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.700> proxy<00:04:04.090> panel<00:04:04.480> bit<00:04:04.660> so

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
that probe to make a proxy panel bit so

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.539 
that probe to make a proxy panel bit so
I<00:04:05.079> can<00:04:05.260> actually<00:04:05.410> warp<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.250> other<00:04:06.400> side

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
I can actually warp in on the other side

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.160 
I can actually warp in on the other side
of<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:06.730> map<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.180> very<00:04:07.299> crucial<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.109> we

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
of the map so it's very crucial that we

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.530 
of the map so it's very crucial that we
keep<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.470> scouting<00:04:08.950> probe<00:04:09.310> alive<00:04:09.639> right

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
keep that scouting probe alive right

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.150 
keep that scouting probe alive right

straight on top of these Ella that just

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.150 
straight on top of these Ella that just
moved<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.320> spread<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.769> APM

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
moved out and if you can spread the APM

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.740 
moved out and if you can spread the APM
you<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.519> use<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:21.880> cell<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.240> actually<00:04:22.360> start

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
you can use this cell to actually start

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.080 
you can use this cell to actually start
poking<00:04:23.080> out<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.200> little<00:04:23.470> bit<00:04:23.710> however<00:04:24.310> right

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
poking out a little bit however right

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.800 
poking out a little bit however right
now<00:04:25.120> we<00:04:25.330> are<00:04:25.479> about<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.810> beam<00:04:26.080> exaggerate

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
now we are about to beam exaggerate

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.210

you<00:04:26.930> can<00:04:27.080> see<00:04:27.230> three<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.620> three<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.040> gas

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
you can see three out of three in gas

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.580 
you can see three out of three in gas
and<00:04:28.490> about<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.270> 16<00:04:29.630> out<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.750> 16<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.410> I'm

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and about to have 16 out of 16 so I'm

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.590 
and about to have 16 out of 16 so I'm
just<00:04:31.100> got<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.310> stop<00:04:31.669> pro<00:04:31.880> production<00:04:32.360> right<00:04:32.480> now

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
just got a stop pro production right now

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.720 
just got a stop pro production right now

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
on the other side of the map as well my

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.879 
on the other side of the map as well my
stalker<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.510> about<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.229> once<00:05:12.470> more<00:05:12.680> if<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
stalker is about to and once more if you

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.159 
stalker is about to and once more if you
can<00:05:13.040> spare<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.340> APM<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:14.240> can<00:05:14.450> try<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.840> micro

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
can spare the APM you can try and micro

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.900 
can spare the APM you can try and micro
does<00:05:15.320> around<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:15.860> it's<00:05:15.979> most<00:05:16.220> important<00:05:16.790> that

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
does around but it's most important that

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.610 
does around but it's most important that
you<00:05:17.270> actually<00:05:17.419> finish<00:05:17.900> all<00:05:18.050> these<00:05:18.169> buildings

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
you actually finish all these buildings

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.010 
you actually finish all these buildings
at<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.860> good<00:05:19.040> timing

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
at the good timing

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.230 
at the good timing
so<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:21.770> probe<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.160> going<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.610> be<00:05:22.700> crucial

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
so this probe is going to be crucial

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.240 
so this probe is going to be crucial
right<00:05:23.660> now<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:23.870> managed<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.290> put<00:05:24.560> up<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.860> proxy

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
right now you managed to put up to proxy

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.190 
right now you managed to put up to proxy
panels<00:05:25.580> already<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.419> closer<00:05:26.690> I<00:05:26.810> get<00:05:26.930> to

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
panels already and the closer I get to

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.170 
panels already and the closer I get to
his<00:05:27.290> base<00:05:27.500> obviously<00:05:28.160> the<00:05:28.250> closer<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.700> can<00:05:28.850> warp

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
his base obviously the closer I can warp

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.370 
his base obviously the closer I can warp
into<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:29.630> inevitable<00:05:30.200> fight<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:33.080> there<00:05:33.229> we<00:05:33.289> go

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
into the inevitable fight so there we go

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.140 
into the inevitable fight so there we go
my<00:05:33.560> work<00:05:33.710> get<00:05:33.890> finished<00:05:33.919> right<00:05:34.460> now<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.940> I'm

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
my work get finished right now and I'm

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.400 
my work get finished right now and I'm
going<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.419> morphing<00:05:35.750> all<00:05:35.930> these<00:05:36.110> gateways

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
going to be morphing all these gateways

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.529 
going to be morphing all these gateways
into<00:05:36.770> warp<00:05:37.070> gates<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.490> right<00:05:37.820> dances<00:05:38.180> vanish

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
into warp gates and right dances vanish

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.750 
into warp gates and right dances vanish
I<00:05:38.690> will<00:05:39.080> start<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.620> bunch<00:05:40.039> of<00:05:40.190> stalkers<00:05:40.580> right

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
I will start a bunch of stalkers right

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.250 
I will start a bunch of stalkers right
now<00:05:40.850> and<00:05:41.030> this<00:05:41.090> is<00:05:41.150> crucial<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.690> need<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.080> move

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
now and this is crucial you need to move

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.630 
now and this is crucial you need to move
up<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.500> ramp<00:05:42.680> right<00:05:42.919> away<00:05:43.100> now<00:05:43.400> if<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.550> take

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
up that ramp right away now if you take

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.310 
up that ramp right away now if you take
a<00:05:43.729> look<00:05:43.880> at<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.030> clock<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.450> was<00:05:44.810> right<00:05:45.080> before

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
a look at the clock it was right before

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.590 
a look at the clock it was right before
the<00:05:45.830> 6<00:05:46.070> minute<00:05:46.310> mark<00:05:46.340> now<00:05:46.850> as<00:05:47.090> well<00:05:47.270> as<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.479> have

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
the 6 minute mark now as well as I have

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.990 
the 6 minute mark now as well as I have
gas<00:05:47.840> available<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.620> will<00:05:49.100> actually<00:05:49.580> warp<00:05:49.850> in

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
gas available I will actually warp in

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.300 
gas available I will actually warp in
stalkers<00:05:50.660> however<00:05:51.050> as<00:05:51.530> you<00:05:51.650> can<00:05:51.800> see<00:05:52.010> right

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
stalkers however as you can see right

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.830 
stalkers however as you can see right
now<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.520> don't<00:05:52.669> have<00:05:53.000> that<00:05:53.180> much<00:05:53.330> gas<00:05:53.539> anymore

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
now I don't have that much gas anymore

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.990 
now I don't have that much gas anymore
so<00:05:54.110> whenever<00:05:54.289> it's<00:05:54.560> necessary<00:05:54.710> I<00:05:55.310> will<00:05:55.760> switch

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
so whenever it's necessary I will switch

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.370 
so whenever it's necessary I will switch
out<00:05:56.180> two<00:05:56.330> zealots<00:05:56.660> as<00:05:56.810> well<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.080> here<00:05:57.200> we<00:05:57.260> go

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
I'm gonna be with my second warp in two

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.110 
I'm gonna be with my second warp in two
zealots<00:05:59.870> and<00:05:59.990> two<00:06:00.350> stalkers<00:06:00.830> and<00:06:01.280> if<00:06:01.850> you<00:06:01.940> want

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120

zealots and two stalkers and if you want
to<00:06:02.180> be<00:06:02.270> absolutely<00:06:02.389> perfect<00:06:02.840> what<00:06:03.229> you<00:06:03.350> want

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
to be absolutely perfect what you want

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.440 
to be absolutely perfect what you want
to<00:06:03.650> do<00:06:03.800> is<00:06:03.979> make<00:06:04.460> sure<00:06:04.490> your<00:06:04.910> zealots<00:06:05.210> go<00:06:05.300> up

to do is make sure your zealots go up

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.390 
to do is make sure your zealots go up
the<00:06:05.570> ramp<00:06:05.690> first<00:06:05.960> followed<00:06:06.710> by<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.889> stalkers

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
the ramp first followed by the stalkers

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.800 
the ramp first followed by the stalkers
just<00:06:07.669> because<00:06:07.850> they<00:06:07.970> tank<00:06:08.210> a<00:06:08.360> whole<00:06:08.539> lot<00:06:08.690> more

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
just because they tank a whole lot more

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.600 
just because they tank a whole lot more
damage<00:06:08.990> than<00:06:09.139> stalkers<00:06:09.620> do<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:09.950> just<00:06:10.400> keep

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
damage than stalkers do and just keep

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.370 
damage than stalkers do and just keep
warping<00:06:11.000> in<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.300> keep<00:06:11.810> attacking<00:06:12.110> your

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
warping in and keep attacking your

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.409 
warping in and keep attacking your
opponent<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:12.919> this<00:06:13.070> should<00:06:13.340> be<00:06:13.370> an<00:06:13.669> easy<00:06:14.120> win

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
opponent and this should be an easy win

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.810 
opponent and this should be an easy win
in<00:06:14.630> most<00:06:15.200> of<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.440> lower<00:06:15.620> leagues<00:06:15.860> now<00:06:16.550> as<00:06:16.669> far

in most of the lower leagues now as far

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.100 
in most of the lower leagues now as far
as<00:06:16.880> practice<00:06:17.270> goes<00:06:17.450> what<00:06:17.660> I<00:06:17.690> would<00:06:17.870> really

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
as practice goes what I would really

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.080 
as practice goes what I would really
advise<00:06:18.440> you<00:06:18.470> to<00:06:18.740> do<00:06:18.889> is<00:06:19.070> open<00:06:19.340> up<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.700> custom

will instantly be victorious and that

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.379 
will instantly be victorious and that
that<00:06:27.470> way<00:06:27.650> you<00:06:28.070> can<00:06:28.250> actually<00:06:28.430> practice<00:06:29.000> this

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
that way you can actually practice this

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.570 
that way you can actually practice this
bill<00:06:29.600> order<00:06:29.990> without<00:06:30.590> having<00:06:30.919> to<00:06:31.039> worry<00:06:31.280> about

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
bill order without having to worry about

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.310 
bill order without having to worry about
an<00:06:31.700> opponent<00:06:32.150> so<00:06:32.510> make<00:06:32.750> sure<00:06:32.780> you<00:06:33.110> hit<00:06:33.260> the

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
an opponent so make sure you hit the

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.290 
an opponent so make sure you hit the
exact<00:06:33.800> same<00:06:33.950> timing<00:06:34.370> as<00:06:34.490> I<00:06:34.610> did<00:06:34.789> in<00:06:34.909> this<00:06:35.030> game

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
exact same timing as I did in this game

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.940 
exact same timing as I did in this game
so<00:06:35.720> you<00:06:35.780> can<00:06:35.990> actually<00:06:36.260> practice<00:06:36.470> this<00:06:36.740> until

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
so you can actually practice this until

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.800 
so you can actually practice this until
you<00:06:37.220> do<00:06:37.400> that<00:06:37.610> and<00:06:37.880> it<00:06:38.270> might<00:06:38.419> take<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.690> maybe

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
you do that and it might take you maybe

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.670 
you do that and it might take you maybe
10<00:06:39.169> games

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
10 games

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.230 
10 games
might<00:06:39.919> take<00:06:40.100> you<00:06:40.220> like<00:06:40.340> 20<00:06:40.759> games<00:06:40.970> if<00:06:41.120> you're

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
might take you like 20 games if you're

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.210 
might take you like 20 games if you're
completely<00:06:41.780> new<00:06:41.930> but<00:06:42.139> once<00:06:42.680> you<00:06:42.800> figure<00:06:42.949> that

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
completely new but once you figure that

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.279 
completely new but once you figure that
out<00:06:43.400> and<00:06:43.610> then<00:06:44.330> jump<00:06:44.570> to<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:44.810> ladder<00:06:45.080> and

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
out and then jump to the ladder and

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:46.810 
out and then jump to the ladder and
actually<00:06:45.590> play<00:06:45.770> for<00:06:46.009> this<00:06:46.100> real<00:06:46.280> opponent<00:06:46.729> it

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
actually play for this real opponent it

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.210 
actually play for this real opponent it
will<00:06:47.240> be<00:06:47.360> so<00:06:47.720> so<00:06:47.960> much<00:06:48.080> easier<00:06:48.500> because<00:06:48.889> that

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
will be so so much easier because that

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.439 
will be so so much easier because that
way<00:06:49.310> you<00:06:49.370> don't<00:06:49.669> really<00:06:49.820> need<00:06:50.000> to<00:06:50.120> think<00:06:50.330> about

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
way you don't really need to think about

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.150 
way you don't really need to think about
it<00:06:50.690> anymore<00:06:50.900> and<00:06:51.050> you<00:06:51.229> can<00:06:51.380> just<00:06:51.590> naturally

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
it anymore and you can just naturally

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.159 
it anymore and you can just naturally
progress<00:06:52.610> in<00:06:53.300> your<00:06:53.360> skill<00:06:53.750> level<00:06:54.050> in

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
progress in your skill level in

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.020 
progress in your skill level in
StarCraft<00:06:54.620> II<00:06:54.740> so<00:06:55.160> yeah<00:06:55.280> that<00:06:55.550> is<00:06:55.639> pretty<00:06:55.669> much

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
StarCraft II so yeah that is pretty much

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.400 
StarCraft II so yeah that is pretty much
