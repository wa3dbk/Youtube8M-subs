00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.859 
potential situation and these giving you
an<00:01:24.340> opportunity<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.880> absorb<00:01:25.300> what<00:01:25.630> may<00:01:25.810> be

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
an opportunity to absorb what may be

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.740 
an opportunity to absorb what may be
coming<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.700> times<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.090> players<00:01:28.390> get

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
coming a lot of times the players get

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.900 
coming a lot of times the players get
beat<00:01:29.500> up<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.770> little<00:01:30.040> bit<00:01:30.190> for<00:01:30.369> wanting<00:01:30.790> or

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
beat up a little bit for wanting or

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.150 
beat up a little bit for wanting or
requesting<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.540> trade<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.860> think

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
requesting the trade and I think

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.960 
requesting the trade and I think
sometimes<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:34.300> know<00:01:34.900> wrongfully<00:01:35.500> so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.610 

sometimes<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.120> situation<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.870> just<00:01:41.080> doesn't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
sometimes the situation is just doesn't

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.420 
sometimes the situation is just doesn't
fit<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.890> one<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:42.550> various<00:01:42.940> reasons<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.470> so<00:01:44.980> I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
fit in one for various reasons and so I

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.520 
fit in one for various reasons and so I
think<00:01:45.970> both<00:01:46.600> sides<00:01:46.870> would<00:01:47.020> be<00:01:47.140> better<00:01:47.290> served

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
think both sides would be better served

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.830 
think both sides would be better served
sometimes<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.190> things<00:01:48.370> are<00:01:48.490> more<00:01:48.840> shattering

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
sometimes of things are more shattering

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.250 
sometimes of things are more shattering
table<00:01:50.230> and<00:01:50.410> how<00:01:50.530> front<00:01:51.960> everybody<00:01:52.960> can<00:01:53.140> go

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
table and how front everybody can go

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.230 
table and how front everybody can go

felt<00:02:16.660> strongly<00:02:17.020> about<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.680> guess<00:02:18.010> where<00:02:18.220> his

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
felt strongly about I guess where his

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.800 
felt strongly about I guess where his
team<00:02:18.640> where<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:18.910> organization<00:02:19.420> was<00:02:19.480> headed

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
team where this organization was headed

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.140 
team where this organization was headed
because<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> part<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.920> anymore

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
because it's not a part of it anymore

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.540 
because it's not a part of it anymore
although<00:02:22.150> he<00:02:22.300> will<00:02:22.450> always<00:02:22.780> be<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.620> part<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
although he will always be a part of it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.630 
although he will always be a part of it

out<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> window<00:03:07.150> obviously<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.880> know<00:03:10.000> but

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
out a window obviously you know but

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.810 
out a window obviously you know but
every<00:03:10.930> team<00:03:11.140> each<00:03:11.830> year<00:03:12.160> even<00:03:12.340> when<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.670> have

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
every team each year even when you have

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.290 
every team each year even when you have
the<00:03:13.090> same<00:03:13.300> returning<00:03:13.840> cast<00:03:14.970> every<00:03:15.970> year<00:03:16.180> is<00:03:16.270> a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
the same returning cast every year is a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.020 
the same returning cast every year is a
little<00:03:16.570> bit<00:03:16.660> different<00:03:17.730> obviously<00:03:18.730> for<00:03:18.910> us

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
little bit different obviously for us

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.520 
little bit different obviously for us
personnel<00:03:19.540> wise<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:20.020> would<00:03:20.110> be<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.260> lot

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
personnel wise it would be a lot

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.970 
personnel wise it would be a lot
different<00:03:21.960> but<00:03:22.960> you<00:03:23.230> know<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.500> challenges

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
different but you know the challenges

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.980 
different but you know the challenges
will<00:03:24.190> still<00:03:24.400> remain<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.820> same<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.660> challenge

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
will still remain the same the challenge

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.740 
will still remain the same the challenge
is<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.200> stay<00:03:26.380> healthy<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:28.270> know<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.420> figure

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
is to stay healthy you know to figure

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.330 
is to stay healthy you know to figure
out<00:03:28.810> where<00:03:29.020> they<00:03:29.110> have<00:03:29.290> one<00:03:29.560> common<00:03:29.800> goal<00:03:29.980> as<00:03:30.310> a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
out where they have one common goal as a

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.580 
out where they have one common goal as a
clearly<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.870> know<00:03:31.990> do<00:03:32.140> all<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.410> things

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
clearly and you know do all the things

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.280 
clearly and you know do all the things
it<00:03:32.830> takes<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.250> be<00:03:33.400> successful<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:35.200> know

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
it takes to be successful you know

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.630 
it takes to be successful you know
regardless<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.830> who's<00:03:35.950> on<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.190> roster<00:03:36.490> those

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
regardless of who's on the roster those

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.800 
regardless of who's on the roster those
things<00:03:36.940> will<00:03:37.150> always<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:38.680> challenges<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.430> so

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
things will always be challenges and so

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.630 
things will always be challenges and so
for<00:03:40.810> as<00:03:40.900> long<00:03:41.020> as<00:03:41.080> I'm<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:41.440> or<00:03:41.920> any<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.310> us<00:03:42.520> are

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
here I guess you know we'll have to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.920 
here I guess you know we'll have to
continue<00:03:45.460> to<00:03:45.580> make<00:03:46.330> sure<00:03:46.510> we're<00:03:46.660> trying<00:03:46.870> to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
continue to make sure we're trying to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.890 
continue to make sure we're trying to
stay<00:03:47.050> focused<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.500> those<00:03:47.620> things
