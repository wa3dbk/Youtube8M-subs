00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
like what I what I sometimes do is I put

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.880 
like what I what I sometimes do is I put
the<00:02:59.940> phone<00:03:00.120> upside<00:03:00.510> down<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:01.709> the

the phone upside down and that way the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.350 
the phone upside down and that way the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.030 
court comes out here through the side
you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.870> do<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.110> too<00:03:04.260> since<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> corners

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
you can do that too since the corners

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.710 
you can do that too since the corners
are<00:03:05.160> exposed<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.790> then<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> run<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.360> up<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> the
