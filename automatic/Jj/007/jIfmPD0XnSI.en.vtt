00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.500
 let's see the data needed to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.629
 use the calculation rule back 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.919
 breathing an engine first in the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.919
 length of the slot 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.210
 that we measure with a meter or with a rule 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.510
 We measure the tooth width with a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.250
 caliber 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 as seen in the figure 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.930
 then we measure the thickness of the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.300
 crown 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.090
 the distance from the bottom of 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.300
 the slot to the housing 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.720
 and finally we measure the diameter of the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.720
 broken 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.880
 all these measures have to be in 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.880
 centimeters 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.850
 let's see an example of an engine with 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.820
 a slot length of 73 the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.260
 rotor diameter 83 the width of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.830
 teeth 04 crown thickness 1,7 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.190
 has 24 slots and goes to 3 thousand 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.190
 revolutions 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.970
 first we place the cursor on the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.970
 engine revolutions in this case 3000 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.780
 placed between 1000 and then 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.390
 we face with the cursor the length of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.380
 the slot that are 73 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.930
 we move the white rule 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.930
 up to 7 with 3 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.369
 then we move the cursor 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.369
 up to the mark and h 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.390
 markariÃ¡n 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.340
 and then we face the diameter 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.810
 of the rotor 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.810
 with the course 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.520
 rotor diameter which are 83 is at 75 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.930
 we moved the yellow strip 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.930
 until 8 with 3 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.349
 then we move the cursor 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.739
 up to where it puts induction in / 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.739
 iron 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.860
 as it is at three thousand revolutions all 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.470
 the engines at 3000 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.550
 we put it inside the area with the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.880
 number 1 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:07.450
 if it is at 1500 or 750 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.489
 we can take you to number 2 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.489
 tower 3000 all in 1 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.050
 we can read the feel that will bring 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:26.340
 230 to 400 volts 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:30.170
 1400 mark between the 24 slots would be 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.800
 58 turns each slot 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:40.470
 if we look at the scale of 400 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.470
 we have 2400 spears 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.360
 in this case between the 24 slots would be 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.360
 100 turns per slot 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.329
 now without moving the cursor we are going to 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.090
 check the induction in the teeth 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:02.439
 we match the width of teeth 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.569
 that is in the yellow rule with the 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.170
 slot number that is in the rule 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.170
 white 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.520
 24.04 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.290
 and we see that we are left out of the 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.780
 induction in the teeth and crown 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.360
 that means we have to move 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.860
 the power strip until it enters into that 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.830
 industry zone 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.509
 there we see that we should give it in 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.509
 1500 spiral 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.960
 now let's check if with those 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.620
 turns 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.050
 we are worth the induction in the crown 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.560
 we match the length with the 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.560
 mark the length f that are 73 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:58.580
 we move 567 with 3 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.230
 and now the thickness of the crown what 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.060
 we match the efe brand 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:12.040
 thickness of the crown that is 17 is in 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.970
 145 we move to 17 the rule 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.970
 yellow 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.550
 one 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.820
 and we see that we are within the zone 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.430
 of normal induction I mean that 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.580
 this engine would have to carry 1500 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.100
 they exhale that divided between 24 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:38.160
 slots each 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.160
 it would be 63 breathe 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:53.930
 this calculation is for all engines 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.930
 made some layer and serial connection 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.169
 if you are interested in this calculation rule 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.610
 to receive it you must accept the 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:08.300
 subscribed and have me in your circles 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.300
 thanks for follow me
