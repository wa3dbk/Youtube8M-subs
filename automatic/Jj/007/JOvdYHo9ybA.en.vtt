00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi friends today decided to show you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.049
 a set of exercises that I use 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.650
 the last two months probably already this 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.500
 in addition to training in the gym 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.670
 a kind of crossfit style 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.379
 combination of movements or who likes 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.359
 more old school is just a circular 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.080
 training with fundamental 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.240
 functional movements in my opinion 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 these three exercises that I now 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.650
 will demonstrate 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 add effect to those basic movements 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.340
 which I do in the hall 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.340
 keeping in mind keeping the same in mind 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.520
 target set muscle mass here is this triple 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 gives its effect so I decided with you 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.710
 share these exercises and so 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.050
 let's start to see and I built a small one here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 such a construction 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.149
 adaptation of protozoa so I 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 I think that it will not be difficult for you if 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.059
 there is not even something nearby 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 weld it out of metal with 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.329
 welders professional can do it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.010
 make but tires can be found where 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.950
 Pleased so the first exercise is a bench press. 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.479
 for deltoid muscles and upper chest 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.360
 weight here I do not know tire more than a hundred 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 kilograms exactly but there naturally 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.299
 lever and everything else 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.189
 so I do not know how much it turns out 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.189
 kilogram task to do two times so 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.929
 23 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.159
 although u happiness 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.640
 tongue 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.640
 . 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.840
 be 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.580
 12 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.690
 13 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.820
 france will be changed 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.820
 petros 16 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.500
 215 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.880
 18 come schA 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.880
 or so 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.650
 20 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.650
 let me just share 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.000
 oh yeah that is how you understand the technique here 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.490
 not so fundamentally 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.420
 tasks from point a to point b feet i'm not 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.790
 I help that is not trying to nudge 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.740
 work all the same pure muscle but 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.660
 Naturally all she still some 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.870
 inertia through the body passes all but nekra 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.290
 spring many change what forward what 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.630
 backwards 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.850
 so functional movement is not 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.670
 insulating task in no way 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.620
 make through force and without rest go 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.270
 to the next station I am now 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.910
 so of course I talk a little 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.780
 rest turns out but catch your breath like you 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 correctly noticed the conversation prevents 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.150
 catch your breath the same tire exactly as 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.280
 there is now a kind of deadlift 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.280
 coup tires task to do 6 times 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.440
 but 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.700
 you 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.700
 Who 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.670
 Yes 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.470
 Yes 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:47.299
 and right after 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:52.129
 hammer how much he weighs no more heavy 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:55.129
 which was on sale it can be bought 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.829
 beat here so flat you can beat 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.060
 normal i hit normal 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.129
 tire I do not mind you can find another 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.700
 task 20 times the sum of 10 each side 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.700
 go 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.650
 news 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.570
 batik 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.220
 olya 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.310
 Yes 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.040
 such a trio of guys only three 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:04.110
 movement uniquely first power 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.670
 turning a tire power hammer 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.550
 cardio 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:15.570
 there is more explosiveness too 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:18.750
 there is a shock you together charges the whole body 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.400
 mostly the upper part of course 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.800
 rest minute two 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.210
 you can do the second round I do you 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.660
 I recommend try to make five six 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.000
 such circles with similar equipment 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.380
 movement though similar to movement 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.470
 which we do in the gym 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.050
 but still the vector is changing with the same 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.360
 tire yes it seems like a camp 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.580
 traction but 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.950
 vector changes it makes movement 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.440
 more alive we work alive 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.000
 the subject is shorter i recommend you 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.430
 try this three write in 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.690
 comments what do you think about it 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.070
 good luck on in training and see you in 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.070
 next releases bye friends
