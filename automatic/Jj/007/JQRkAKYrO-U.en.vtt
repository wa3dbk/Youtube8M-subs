 up to 3 frets 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.100
 our index finger is already reaching for 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.100

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.590
 then comes the hummer on the first fret of the second 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.920
 strings then put the second finger on 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.350
 third string 2 frets 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.540

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.470
 we play it together with the second string 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.800

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:37.910
 fourth open and again 3 that's what u 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.270

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.270
 it turns out 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.450
 our next figure looks like this 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:01.330
 here we put the third finger on the third string 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.670
 2 frets then open 2 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.410
 he is followed by ordinary a minor 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.240
 chord picks up the fifth and second string 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.770
 at the same time 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.080
 then we go upward we take the third personal 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.290
 mouth of the string the next figure looks 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.290
 So 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.300
 first play the second open then 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.140

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.240
 2 frets hummer 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.190
 then the first finger picks up the third 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.250
 string 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:46.660

 go down 3 2 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.349
 little finger clamp the second string 3 frets 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.459
 and openly the first 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.459
 our next figure looks like this 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.850
 we put in D major at the same time we hook 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:21.870
 fourth and first string 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:24.270
 then go up 2 3 again 2 1 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.510
 little finger we clamp the first string on the 3rd 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:34.840

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:34.840
 hummer 2 3 and 2 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.060

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.060
 like the first 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.150
 and the last figure is played here 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.150
 So 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.940
 first open string 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.840
 then we clamp it on the second fret 5 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:13.080
 string 3 fret and first string 3 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.080
 played at the same time 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.560
 after this game he is just the second 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:25.620
 open and third open further 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.750
 we clamp the first string on the second fret 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.870
 then hummer 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.200

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.920
 then comes the fifth string and the first 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.580
 open 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:46.069
 at the same time then the second open 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.069
 3 again 2 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.960
 and it only remains for us to clamp the second string 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.750
 on the third fret 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.250
 1 arranged on the second 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.250
 and put in E minor 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.569
 well, and ultimately you should 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.569
