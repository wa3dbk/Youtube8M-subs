00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay today we're going to learn how to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.120 
okay today we're going to learn how to
do<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.030> open<00:00:03.360> grass<00:00:03.570> hand<00:00:03.959> spin<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.920> looks

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
do the open grass hand spin and it looks

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.130 
do the open grass hand spin and it looks
like<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.299> much<00:00:06.450> force<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> use

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
like this and how much force to use

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.140 
like this and how much force to use
behind<00:00:07.589> your<00:00:07.740> fingers<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.820> your<00:00:08.970> wrist

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
will it be dependent on have the soup

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.970 
will it be dependent on have the soup

it's going to want to go down because

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
it's going to want to go down because
the<00:00:20.189> gravity's<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> push<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.240> down<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the gravity's going to push it down and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.170 
the gravity's going to push it down and
big<00:00:22.260> hoops<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.250> you're

bottle and try to open the water bottle

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.420 
bottle and try to open the water bottle
but<00:00:36.899> instead<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.260> gripping<00:00:37.649> your<00:00:37.829> hands<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
but instead of gripping your hands and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100 
but instead of gripping your hands and
going<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.300> around<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.989> your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
going all the way around with your

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
fingers for this trick you're going to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
fingers for this trick you're going to
only<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.390> until<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.170> hits<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.620> side

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
only want to go until it hits the side

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.369 
only want to go until it hits the side
and<00:00:44.640> imagine<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.690> instead<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.989> having<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and imagine that instead of having the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
and imagine that instead of having the
open<00:00:46.649> water<00:00:47.039> bottle<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.430> top<00:00:47.660> you're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
open water bottle on top you're going to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680 
open water bottle on top you're going to
flip<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> upside<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.640> told<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.270> don't

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
flip it upside down if I told you don't

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
flip it upside down if I told you don't
move<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> top<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> water<00:00:53.100> bottle<00:00:53.370> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
move the top of the water bottle or

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
move the top of the water bottle or
don't<00:00:53.670> move<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> water<00:00:54.059> bottle<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> lid

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
don't move the water bottle just the lid

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
don't move the water bottle just the lid
you're<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> focus<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.489> attention

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you're going to focus all your attention

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.529 
you're going to focus all your attention
on<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.440> thumb<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.670> your

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
on your thumb like right here and your

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.590 
on your thumb like right here and your
fingers<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.770> wrist<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.210> i

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
fingers as well as your wrist so if i

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.130 
fingers as well as your wrist so if i
take<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> water<00:01:04.080> bottle<00:01:04.290> off<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.040> told<00:01:05.309> you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
take a water bottle off and I told you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
take a water bottle off and I told you
don't<00:01:07.140> move<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.040> top<00:01:08.310> point<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> hoop<00:01:09.330> but

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
don't move the top point of the hoop but

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
don't move the top point of the hoop but
you<00:01:10.140> need<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> spin<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.159> hoop<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:12.150> it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you need to spin the hoop then it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800 
you need to spin the hoop then it's
going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> look<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.570> prep<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
going to look like this and then prep it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
going to look like this and then prep it
so<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.430> mind<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:18.210> fingers<00:01:18.659> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
so with that in mind your fingers are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.800 
so with that in mind your fingers are
going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> hoop<00:01:19.530> behind<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
going to be on the hoop behind it and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to have a lot of force and push then the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
to have a lot of force and push then the
index<00:01:28.530> finger<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> thumb<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.460> to

index finger and the thumb are going to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
index finger and the thumb are going to
help<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> decide<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.840> direction<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.350> goes

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
