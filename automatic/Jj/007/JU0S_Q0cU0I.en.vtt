00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.500 

first<00:01:12.630> thing<00:01:12.870> I'm<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:15.240> take<00:01:15.479> my

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
first thing I'm going to do is take my

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.280 
first thing I'm going to do is take my
tone<00:01:15.930> generator<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.659> I'm<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.260> if

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
tone generator and I'm going to see if

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
tone generator and I'm going to see if
there's<00:01:19.619> any<00:01:19.860> shorts<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.550> this<00:01:20.790> line<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.420> I'm

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there's any shorts on this line so I'm

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.810 
there's any shorts on this line so I'm
going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> flip<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.979> continuity

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
going to flip it to the continuity

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.260 
going to flip it to the continuity
position<00:01:25.190> take<00:01:26.190> my<00:01:26.509> rj45<00:01:27.509> plug<00:01:29.000> plug<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> in

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
position take my rj45 plug plug it in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.490 
position take my rj45 plug plug it in
oops<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.350> rj45<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.399> rj11<00:01:33.500> plug

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
oops now this is an rj45 this rj11 plug

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.940 
oops now this is an rj45 this rj11 plug
in<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.830> rj11<00:01:35.690> there's<00:01:36.690> no<00:01:36.960> lad<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.470> light<00:01:37.649> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in my rj11 there's no lad that light so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.880 
in my rj11 there's no lad that light so
I<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.399> any<00:01:38.580> shorts<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.300> line<00:01:39.479> I

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
I don't have any shorts on the line I

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
I don't have any shorts on the line I
then<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.399> flip<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.360> off

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
then I'm going to flip it to the off

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.029 
then I'm going to flip it to the off
position<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.479> any<00:01:46.170> central

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there is not and these switch positions

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.169 
there is not and these switch positions
and<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:55.880> covered<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.000> this

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
and what is on them is covered in this

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.900

here yes indeed there is so a nice
little<00:04:13.460> safety<00:04:13.820> feature<00:04:14.300> when<00:04:14.750> i'm<00:04:14.900> working

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
little safety feature when i'm working

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.520 
little safety feature when i'm working
in<00:04:15.700> especially<00:04:16.700> darkened<00:04:17.690> areas<00:04:18.110> where<00:04:18.470> i

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
in especially darkened areas where i

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:26.280 
in especially darkened areas where i
want<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.830> stay<00:04:19.010> away<00:04:19.280> from<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.120> power

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.050 

now<00:04:27.290> here<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.560> have<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> situation<00:04:28.250> where<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:28.970> have

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
now here I have a situation where I have

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.810 
now here I have a situation where I have
multiple<00:04:29.600> sockets<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:31.130> want<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.370> see<00:04:31.520> if<00:04:31.670> I

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
multiple sockets and I want to see if I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.860 
multiple sockets and I want to see if I
have<00:04:32.060> any<00:04:32.090> live<00:04:32.950> telephone<00:04:33.950> lines<00:04:34.400> on<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.870> so

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
have any live telephone lines on it so

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.190 
have any live telephone lines on it so
let's<00:04:36.020> take<00:04:36.230> my<00:04:36.700> rj11<00:04:37.700> connector<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:38.390> let's

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
let's take my rj11 connector and let's

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.810 
let's take my rj11 connector and let's
look<00:04:39.410> at<00:04:39.560> this<00:04:39.740> lead<00:04:40.070> right<00:04:40.340> here<00:04:40.610> on<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
look at this lead right here on the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.040 
look at this lead right here on the
proton<00:04:42.520> now<00:04:43.520> nothing<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.210> saga<00:04:44.690> let's

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
proton now nothing in that saga let's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.120 
proton now nothing in that saga let's
say<00:04:45.170> this<00:04:45.320> one's<00:04:45.560> labeled<00:04:45.800> facts<00:04:47.380> no<00:04:48.380> nothing

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
say this one's labeled facts no nothing

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.880 
say this one's labeled facts no nothing
in<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:49.280> one<00:04:49.960> how<00:04:50.960> about<00:04:50.990> this<00:04:51.320> one<00:04:51.380> here<00:04:52.010> oh

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
in that one how about this one here oh

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.060 
in that one how about this one here oh
nothing<00:04:54.890> here<00:04:55.400> now<00:04:55.640> here<00:04:55.970> we<00:04:56.180> have<00:04:57.070> something

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
nothing here now here we have something

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.980 
nothing here now here we have something
plugged<00:04:58.370> into<00:04:58.700> it<00:04:58.820> let's<00:04:59.180> let's<00:04:59.600> see<00:04:59.690> what's

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
plugged into it let's let's see what's

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.480 
plugged into it let's let's see what's
on<00:05:00.140> here<00:05:01.480> sure<00:05:02.480> enough<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:03.080> green<00:05:03.950> LED<00:05:04.190> lights

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
on here sure enough a green LED lights

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.080 
on here sure enough a green LED lights
meeting<00:05:04.940> that's<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.390> correct<00:05:05.720> polarity<00:05:06.110> of

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
meeting that's the correct polarity of

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.760 
meeting that's the correct polarity of
DC<00:05:08.090> voltage<00:05:08.570> coming<00:05:08.870> out<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.290> here<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:09.740> I

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
DC voltage coming out of here so I

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
DC voltage coming out of here so I
suspect<00:05:10.490> that's<00:05:10.730> either<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.890> pbx<00:05:12.890> of<00:05:13.250> some<00:05:13.490> sort

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
suspect that's either a pbx of some sort

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.620 
suspect that's either a pbx of some sort
or<00:05:14.120> just<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.750> central<00:05:15.140> office<00:05:15.500> voltage<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:17.150> the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
or just a central office voltage so the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.010 
or just a central office voltage so the

good storm strong tone for the probe to

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.850 
good storm strong tone for the probe to
