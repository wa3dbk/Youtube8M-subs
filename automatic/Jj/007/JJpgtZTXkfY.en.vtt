all right today we're gonna May 2010
we're<00:00:08.250> gonna<00:00:08.429> take<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:10.460> video<00:00:11.460> tour

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we're gonna take the first video tour

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.890 
we're gonna take the first video tour
the<00:00:12.540> Ranger<00:00:13.259> Evie<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.360> thing<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> want<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
the Ranger Evie and one thing I want to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.519 
the Ranger Evie and one thing I want to
look<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.230> first<00:00:19.010> on<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.970> Viper<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.140> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
look at first on this Viper and it is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
look at first on this Viper and it is
bolted<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:26.750> ride

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
bolted in but they don't have a ride

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.460 
bolted in but they don't have a ride
correct<00:00:29.070> bracket<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> tomorrow<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.260> gonna

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
correct bracket so tomorrow I'm gonna

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.990 
correct bracket so tomorrow I'm gonna
make<00:00:31.619> some<00:00:31.859> brackets<00:00:32.660> but<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.200> see

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
make some brackets but as you can see

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.160 
make some brackets but as you can see
here's<00:00:36.000> where<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> bolts<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.850> there's<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
here's where it bolts and there's a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.799 
here's where it bolts and there's a
mounting<00:00:40.170> plate<00:00:41.040> down<00:00:41.489> below<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.329> basically

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
mounting plate down below so basically

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
mounting plate down below so basically
I'm<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> take<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> piece<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.610> metal<00:00:44.820> here

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I'm going to take a piece of metal here

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.020 
I'm going to take a piece of metal here
and<00:00:45.539> put<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> metal<00:00:46.770> piece<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.250> metal<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and put a metal piece of metal there and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.150 
and put a metal piece of metal there and
weld<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.899> together<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.039> gonna

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
weld it together and then I'm gonna

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.479 
weld it together and then I'm gonna
mount<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:51.230> Hawker<00:00:52.230> batteries<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.219> here

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
mount two Hawker batteries right in here

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.990 
mount two Hawker batteries right in here
and<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> contactor<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.910> I'm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and the contactor and this one what I'm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
and the contactor and this one what I'm
doing<00:00:57.270> has<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> remote<00:00:57.780> control<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
doing has a remote control so that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.180 
doing has a remote control so that
should<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.100> interesting

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
should be interesting

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:13.399 
should be interesting
in<00:01:02.190> any<00:01:02.370> way<00:01:09.020> it'll<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:11.090> nice<00:01:12.090> install<00:01:12.750> it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
in any way it'll be a nice install it's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
in any way it'll be a nice install it's
all<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.830> getting<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.760> dirty<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
all about getting it dirty here and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
all about getting it dirty here and
drawing<00:01:15.689> around<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.140> earth<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> explain<00:01:21.000> my

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
drawing around the earth so explain my

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.709 
drawing around the earth so explain my
observations<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.250> low<00:01:23.430> medium<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:23.970> high

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
observations on the low medium and high

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.480 
observations on the low medium and high
low<00:01:26.350> definitely<00:01:27.390> limits<00:01:28.390> your<00:01:28.719> speed<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.369> it

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
low definitely limits your speed but it

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.330 
low definitely limits your speed but it
also<00:01:31.229> gives<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.380> more<00:01:32.560> takeoff<00:01:33.039> torque<00:01:33.549> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
also gives you more takeoff torque and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.309 
also gives you more takeoff torque and
you<00:01:36.340> know<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:37.149> probably<00:01:37.359> uses<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:38.140> good

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
you know so it probably uses it's good

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.980 
you know so it probably uses it's good
for<00:01:38.469> towing<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.240> also<00:01:40.359> has<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.780> most

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
for towing but it also has the most

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.169 
for towing but it also has the most
region<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.890> if<00:01:41.950> you're<00:01:42.069> going<00:01:42.280> downhill<00:01:42.549> it

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
region so if you're going downhill it

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.059 
region so if you're going downhill it
definitely<00:01:43.689> slows<00:01:44.049> you<00:01:44.229> down<00:01:44.259> when<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.890> let

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
definitely slows you down when you let

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.880 
definitely slows you down when you let
off<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.490> uh<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:46.959> gas<00:01:47.289> but<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.619> don't

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
off the uh that's that gas but I don't

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.440 
off the uh that's that gas but I don't
well<00:01:48.099> Scott<00:01:48.459> accelerator<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.890> medium<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
well Scott accelerator the medium you

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.690 
well Scott accelerator the medium you
don't<00:01:52.630> have<00:01:52.929> as<00:01:53.079> much<00:01:53.259> takeoff<00:01:53.770> torque<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.429> it

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
don't have as much takeoff torque and it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.080 
don't have as much takeoff torque and it
limits<00:01:55.060> your<00:01:55.240> top<00:01:56.109> speed<00:01:56.609> so<00:01:57.609> it<00:01:57.729> gives<00:01:57.969> you

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
limits your top speed so it gives you

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.679 
limits your top speed so it gives you
the<00:01:58.209> most<00:01:58.390> range<00:01:59.610> which<00:02:00.610> they<00:02:00.819> say<00:02:01.030> max<00:02:01.329> range

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
the most range which they say max range

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.309 
the most range which they say max range
so<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.619> just<00:02:02.799> limits<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.369> amount<00:02:03.489> of<00:02:04.140> drain<00:02:05.140> on

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
so it just limits the amount of drain on

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.600 
so it just limits the amount of drain on
the<00:02:05.439> battery's<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.860> little<00:02:06.129> bit<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.489> low

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
the battery's a little bit on the low

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.150 
the battery's a little bit on the low
end<00:02:06.640> out<00:02:07.119> on<00:02:07.239> top<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.899> then<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:08.170> high<00:02:08.410> you

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
end out on top in and then I'm high you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.530 
end out on top in and then I'm high you
get<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.549> maximum<00:02:10.269> speed<00:02:11.849> not<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.879> peppy

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
get the maximum speed not a peppy

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.289 
get the maximum speed not a peppy
takeoff<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:14.319> your<00:02:14.500> low<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.730> faster

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
takeoff so your low is just a faster

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.890 
takeoff so your low is just a faster
takeoff<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.920> don't<00:02:18.160> have<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:19.269> speed<00:02:19.599> that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
takeoff just don't have the speed that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.110 
takeoff just don't have the speed that
you<00:02:20.049> have<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.440> high<00:02:20.650> basically<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:24.120> nice

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
you have in high basically so nice

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.319 
you have in high basically so nice
little<00:02:25.480> key<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:29.650> has<00:02:29.889> a<00:02:31.410> cover<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.680> so

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
little key here it has a cover on it so

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.849 
little key here it has a cover on it so
when<00:02:34.329> you<00:02:34.389> put<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:36.690> keeps<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:38.230> guess<00:02:38.560> water

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
when you put it in keeps I guess water

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.670 
when you put it in keeps I guess water
and<00:02:39.040> step<00:02:39.280> off<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:43.090> turn<00:02:43.359> it<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.440> if

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and step off so you turn it in and if

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.809 
and step off so you turn it in and if
you<00:02:44.980> are<00:02:45.690> showing<00:02:46.690> neutral<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:47.560> your<00:02:47.739> gig<00:02:47.950> if

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
you are showing neutral then your gig if

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.650 
you are showing neutral then your gig if
you<00:02:49.060> start<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.660> they<00:02:50.169> were<00:02:50.230> trot<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.859> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you start it they were trot to and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.599 
you start it they were trot to and
forward<00:02:52.660> or<00:02:52.810> reverse<00:02:53.370> there's<00:02:54.370> where<00:02:54.579> it
