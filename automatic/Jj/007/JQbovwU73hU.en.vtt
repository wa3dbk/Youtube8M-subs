much at all and that's the way you've
with<00:00:51.180> pyramid<00:00:51.629> pairs<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.989> early<00:00:52.289> years<00:00:52.469> you

but it remaining branches you tend to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
but it remaining branches you tend to
leave<00:00:56.370> alone<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.210> explain<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.289> later

it's going to pull this down most likely
i'll<00:01:37.049> come<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.380> check<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.590> pair<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
i'll come and check this pair this is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.469 
i'll come and check this pair this is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
i kind of look at this pillow later and
what<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.189> hoping<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> weight<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> these

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
what I'm hoping is at a weight of these

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
what I'm hoping is at a weight of these
that<00:01:46.350> cantilever<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.430> people<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.670> do

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that cantilever some people actually do

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
that cantilever some people actually do
use<00:01:48.180> weights<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.079> it'll<00:01:49.710> pull<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
use weights to do this it'll pull the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
use weights to do this it'll pull the
weight<00:01:50.130> down<00:01:50.630> it'll<00:01:51.630> pull<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> brush<00:01:51.960> down<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
weight down it'll pull the brush down so

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.480 
weight down it'll pull the brush down so
it<00:01:52.409> should<00:01:52.560> hopefully<00:01:52.680> set<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> position

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it should hopefully set in a position

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.940 
it should hopefully set in a position
something<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:54.950> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
something like this which is good it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
something like this which is good it
reduces<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.700> extent<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> will<00:01:57.630> grow<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
reduces the extent which it will grow we

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
reduces the extent which it will grow we
don't<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> grow<00:01:58.409> much<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.520> makes

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
don't have to grow much more and makes

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.550 
don't have to grow much more and makes
you<00:02:00.270> fruit<00:02:00.570> parts<00:02:00.930> although<00:02:01.409> long<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.469> can

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you fruit parts although long you can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.719 
you fruit parts although long you can
tell<00:02:04.740> by<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:07.160> mid<00:02:08.160> mid<00:02:08.459> summer

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
tell by now that you know mid mid summer

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.100 
tell by now that you know mid mid summer
more<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.090> less<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.690> pretty<00:02:09.899> good

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
more or less you can get pretty good

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.950 
more or less you can get pretty good
idea<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:11.039> kind<00:02:11.280> of

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
idea what kind of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.330 
idea what kind of
property<00:02:12.230> going<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> hopefully<00:02:12.620> expect<00:02:13.160> next

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
property going to hopefully expect next

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.250 
property going to hopefully expect next
year<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.390> third<00:02:14.690> year<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:15.080> these

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
year this is the third year of these

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.740 
year this is the third year of these
trees<00:02:15.530> growing<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.880> most<00:02:17.060> decent<00:02:17.270> growth

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
trees growing and the most decent growth

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.390 
trees growing and the most decent growth
this<00:02:18.020> year<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.380> real<00:02:21.560> story<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
this year but the real story is is that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520 
this year but the real story is is that
fantastic<00:02:22.940> production<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.810> fruit<00:02:24.050> bodies

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
fantastic production of fruit bodies

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100

it<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.500> spur<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.490> is<00:02:56.290> what's<00:02:57.290> how<00:02:57.470> I

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
it is the spur this is what's how I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.390 
it is the spur this is what's how I
would<00:02:57.770> see<00:02:57.890> happened<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:59.200> is<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.400> we've

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
would see happened here is that we've

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.370 
would see happened here is that we've
had<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.550> bit<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.760> blosser<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.570> blossom<00:03:03.140> and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
had a bit of blosser but a blossom and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.640 
had a bit of blosser but a blossom and
growth<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:05.120> last<00:03:05.510> year<00:03:05.750> 2009<00:03:06.320> would

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
growth the last year 2009 would

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.960 
growth the last year 2009 would
obviously<00:03:07.400> ended<00:03:07.850> in<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.320> multipotent<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.880> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
obviously ended in a multipotent to the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.790 
obviously ended in a multipotent to the
growing<00:03:11.180> point<00:03:11.600> which<00:03:11.870> has<00:03:12.050> produced<00:03:12.440> one

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
growing point which has produced one

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.880 
growing point which has produced one
actual<00:03:13.400> pear<00:03:13.700> plus<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:15.050> see<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.620> pairs

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
actual pear plus you see that that pairs

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.470 
actual pear plus you see that that pairs
coming<00:03:16.310> away<00:03:16.520> there<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.180> pair<00:03:17.450> has

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
coming away there so this this pair has

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.560 
coming away there so this this pair has
actually<00:03:17.930> been<00:03:18.440> produced<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:20.090> previous

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
actually been produced on the previous

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.930 
actually been produced on the previous
year's<00:03:20.810> wood<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:22.280> wasn't<00:03:22.610> those<00:03:22.730> through

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
year's wood and it wasn't those through

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.190 
year's wood and it wasn't those through
his<00:03:23.060> happened<00:03:23.360> here<00:03:23.510> as<00:03:23.690> well<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:23.930> we've

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
his happened here as well so we've

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.990 
his happened here as well so we've
actually<00:03:24.320> got<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.460> best<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.850> all<00:03:25.940> possible

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
actually got the best of all possible

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.780 
actually got the best of all possible
worlds<00:03:26.450> last<00:03:26.990> year<00:03:27.440> we've<00:03:28.130> got<00:03:28.310> new<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:28.610> was

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
worlds last year we've got new this was

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.090 
worlds last year we've got new this was
new<00:03:28.970> growth<00:03:29.270> that<00:03:29.570> was<00:03:29.720> formed<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:30.680> also<00:03:30.800> got<00:03:31.070> a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
new growth that was formed we also got a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000 
new growth that was formed we also got a
fruit<00:03:31.310> but<00:03:31.490> on<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.730> very<00:03:31.760> tip<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.010> same

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
fruit but on the very tip of it and same

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.130 
fruit but on the very tip of it and same
here<00:03:34.250> as<00:03:34.370> well<00:03:34.550> as<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.910> was<00:03:35.000> saying<00:03:35.140> previously

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
here as well as I was saying previously

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.230 
here as well as I was saying previously
you<00:03:36.530> look<00:03:36.650> at<00:03:36.770> these<00:03:36.890> gross<00:03:37.790> they're<00:03:38.060> very

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
you look at these gross they're very

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.690 
you look at these gross they're very
very<00:03:38.360> upright<00:03:38.780> but<00:03:39.740> what<00:03:39.890> I'm<00:03:40.010> hoping<00:03:40.190> for<00:03:40.460> is

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
remember which variety this is actually

remember which variety this is actually
it's<00:04:05.570> either<00:04:05.750> concord<00:04:06.620> or<00:04:10.600> conference<00:04:11.980> and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
it's either concord or conference and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.040 
it's either concord or conference and
it's<00:04:13.130> another<00:04:13.340> one<00:04:13.550> up<00:04:13.730> here<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.210> think<00:04:14.900> that's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
it's another one up here I think that's

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.430 
it's another one up here I think that's
actually<00:04:15.280> slightly<00:04:16.280> too<00:04:16.790> many<00:04:17.030> pairs<00:04:17.440> so

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
actually slightly too many pairs so

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.600 
actually slightly too many pairs so
we're<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:19.060> snick

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300
