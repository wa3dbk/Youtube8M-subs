00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
hair straight anyway so I went forward

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.599 
hair straight anyway so I went forward
with<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> difference<00:01:01.499> between<00:01:01.609> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
with it and the difference between the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
with it and the difference between the
previous<00:01:02.909> keratin<00:01:03.600> treatment<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.220> one

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
previous keratin treatment and this one

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.750 
previous keratin treatment and this one
is<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> girl<00:01:06.600> who<00:01:06.890> put<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> keratin<00:01:08.460> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
is that the girl who put the keratin in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.050 
is that the girl who put the keratin in
my<00:01:08.970> hair<00:01:09.240> previously<00:01:10.100> she<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.220> straight

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
my hair previously she was straight

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
my hair previously she was straight
haired<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> didn't<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.500> any

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
haired and didn't really have any

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
haired and didn't really have any
experience<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.850> curly<00:01:15.330> hair<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.870> she

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
experience with curly hair and she

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.650 
experience with curly hair and she
probably<00:01:16.500> honestly<00:01:17.460> didn't<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:18.300> that

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
probably honestly didn't think that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.290 
probably honestly didn't think that
applying<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.530> product<00:01:19.980> so<00:01:20.580> curly<00:01:20.970> hair<00:01:21.120> would

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
applying the product so curly hair would

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.210 
applying the product so curly hair would
be<00:01:21.420> different<00:01:21.870> from<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.380> straight<00:01:22.590> hair<00:01:22.770> person

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
be different from a straight hair person

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.600 
be different from a straight hair person
but<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:25.160> different<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.370> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but actually it is different you have to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
but actually it is different you have to
go<00:01:26.760> about<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.480> a<00:01:27.690> different<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.860> new

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
go about it in a different way so a new

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
go about it in a different way so a new
stylist<00:01:29.580> has<00:01:30.030> curly<00:01:30.450> hair<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.900> she<00:01:31.320> actually

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.379 
bangs for a for about two to three weeks
and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.659> was<00:03:26.159> focusing<00:03:27.159> more<00:03:27.519> efforts<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.150> heat

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
and I was focusing more efforts of heat

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.270 
and I was focusing more efforts of heat
on<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.720> front<00:03:29.019> so<00:03:29.349> now<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.680> I'm<00:03:29.799> back<00:03:30.010> with
