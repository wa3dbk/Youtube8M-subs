00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it is possible that authorities will use

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.789 
it is possible that authorities will use
plastic<00:02:02.159> bullets<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.790> quell<00:02:03.119> rioters<00:02:03.869> why

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
plastic bullets to quell rioters why

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
plastic bullets to quell rioters why
haven't<00:02:05.070> water<00:02:05.579> cannons<00:02:06.030> rubber<00:02:06.270> bullets

haven't water cannons rubber bullets
tear<00:02:07.020> gas<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.950> even<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> armed<00:02:08.580> force<00:02:08.849> has

tear gas or even the armed force has
been<00:02:09.030> brought<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.539> yet<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:10.580> think<00:02:11.580> because<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
been brought in yet I think because the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.990 
been brought in yet I think because the
police<00:02:12.209> force<00:02:12.510> over<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
police force over the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.850 
police force over the
years<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.390> been<00:02:13.540> debilitated<00:02:14.440> by<00:02:14.470> this

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
years have been debilitated by this

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.610 
years have been debilitated by this
culture<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.810> political<00:02:16.810> correctness<00:02:17.260> where

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
culture of political correctness where

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.020 
culture of political correctness where
if<00:02:17.860> people<00:02:18.370> are<00:02:18.430> out<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.670> streets<00:02:18.880> doing

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
if people are out on the streets doing

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.400 
if people are out on the streets doing
this<00:02:19.150> holding<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.750> know<00:02:19.870> they<00:02:19.990> must<00:02:20.230> have

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
this holding you know they must have

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230 
this holding you know they must have
some<00:02:20.710> reason<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> poor<00:02:21.520> little<00:02:21.670> dears<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
some reason the poor little dears and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.330 
some reason the poor little dears and
you<00:02:22.660> mustn't<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:23.110> nasty<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.650> them<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.280> think

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
you mustn't be nasty to them and I think

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.490 
you mustn't be nasty to them and I think
the<00:02:24.550> police<00:02:24.820> are<00:02:25.000> kind<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.300> been<00:02:25.630> hide<00:02:25.900> band<00:02:26.260> by

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the police are kind of been hide band by

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.710 
the police are kind of been hide band by
this<00:02:26.680> for<00:02:26.890> years<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.450> what

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
this for years and I think this is what

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.910 
this for years and I think this is what
we're<00:02:28.840> seeing<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.110> now<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.440> see<00:02:29.590> images

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
siege on the streets by these people

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.920 
siege on the streets by these people
you've<00:02:33.400> got<00:02:33.550> women<00:02:34.030> jumping<00:02:34.360> from<00:02:34.540> burning

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
come to get tough with this we must

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.730 
come to get tough with this we must
crush<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.630> otherwise<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.440> going<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> get

crush this otherwise it's going to get

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.170 
crush this otherwise it's going to get
totally<00:02:45.130> out<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.250> hand<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.970> will<00:02:46.060> be<00:02:46.150> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
totally out of hand and it will be a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.750 
totally out of hand and it will be a
constantly<00:02:47.070> reoccurring<00:02:48.070> thing<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.550> don't

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
constantly reoccurring thing if we don't

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.130 
constantly reoccurring thing if we don't
they'll<00:02:49.000> they'll<00:02:49.390> put<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.720> shops<00:02:49.930> back

they'll they'll put the shops back

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.600 
they'll they'll put the shops back
together<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.650> know<00:02:50.770> they'll<00:02:50.920> restock<00:02:51.370> them
