00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 and that they were on YouTube as they were 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.859
 I hope you're very, very good about 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 everything took me and as you see it says that 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.890
 emblem of call of duty black ops' or if 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.130
 There is my range although in fact I am already 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.080
 level 46 but good for those who are 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.269
 phase with you saw them on the map 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 in the republic of yemen and I'm playing 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.529
 with game a master armorer that if not 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 they know what the type of game is about 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 they will see it later on good for sure 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 many destinations that are halo fans of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 my channel have to be saying you're not 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.579
 a traitor you sold yourself no no no es es 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.500
 nothing to do good if they did not know for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.780
 that are new subscribers that there are already 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.460
 many enough I would have 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.899
 also ivory videos 3 but good 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.090
 problem that you could no longer climb 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.620
 go down and phil and I think I still do not know 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 can or if I 'm not investigating 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.149
 to go up since they are games are the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.230
 true ivory but well we are not going to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.239
 talk about marketing let's talk about 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.730
 black ops 2 but to continue giving a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.410
 little bit of annotation there and also went up 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.219
 of various arcade games like embezzled 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.870
 coal 2 metal slug among others 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.760
 Well I would like to start up with the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.890
 furtive copson has already uploaded a tutorial 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 so they can prestige their weapon to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 those who have the game already 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 they will know how and good what happens is that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.730
 the truth is to give the variety of 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.100
 matter what do I mean with this if I go up 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.870
 with the truth, yes, I do get fed up with 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 truth we owe to you if you 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.400
 I really like what I love 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.890
 be clear it's my favorite game of all 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.270
 life but the truth must be given 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.119
 variety to the subject the variety is the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.130
 taste of life the truth is that the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 call of duty black ops or is already good 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.880
 right now I'm going to talk about him but it 's because 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.520
 that I decided to start going up because the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 truth is that as the phrase already says 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 very hot already chole good let's go to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.440
 talk about the call of duty black game 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.330
 ops 2 and input I'm going to tell the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.660
 who are like that, red bone fans of 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.920
 hello that if they think try it buy it 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.500
 but they will be with the mentality of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.060
 that nothing superior halo that the scrub not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 buy it really do not buy it if 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.860
 they will enter with that mentality 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 definitely they are going to go wrong 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.600
 well the game the truth then later that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.640
 I played him he managed to feel the difference 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.399
 between a call of duty made by infinity 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.710
 ward and another for three since the saga of 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 call of duty is made by two companies 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.280
 treyarch and infinity ward infinity ward 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.730
 it's the assholes who made the jalada 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.130
 of modern warfare 3 good I mean 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.070
 that in terms of good quality 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.990
 history and good good modality of 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.610
 good gameplay game will be the great 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.730
 difference between high in the call of 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.380
 duty set to crash forgiveness and 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.180
 infinity ward 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.800
 the truth is multiplayer yes yes it is 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.630
 renewed they made some changes that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.209
 are very notorious I do not mean that a 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.790
 new weapon as many say but that 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.739
 change a part of the call of gameplay 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.650
 duty that still retains the mode 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.090
 original another thing that I really liked is 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.430
 of the story that is pretty good 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.080
 I still do not finish it as the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.730
 events that occurred in black ops 1 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.230
 that was also a great game again 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.620
 made by treyarch 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.690
 in terms of graphics we can not wait 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 a lot if we know it's a loot color 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.890
 in that they are not strong but because 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.470
 they import the graphics that do not make a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.540
 good game yes it looks nice you have to 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.549
 speak it speak but then there we have 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.170
 minecraft we all know the 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.080
 Minecraft practices we buy it or not 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.540
 because there it is a great game and it does not have 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.770
 good graphics so that does not make a 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.720
 good game 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.270
 as for the customization is 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.950
 you can quite well this one among several 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.960
 things to put councils to your weapons 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.820
 change the camouflage to put them 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.700
 Tremblay Matu plants means 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.890
 your service label and other than that 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.660
 you can create your own emblem and how 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.820
 see in the upper corner the corner 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.940
 lower left there is my logo of 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.710
 maximum is nice 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.660
 you can customize the emblem that you 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.540
 want exactly as you want is 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.750
 something very good the truth also another 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.740
 point in his favor is this the system of 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.330
 how to say it about the range since to do 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.850
 this you have to upload here you have to 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.360
 raise this from the weapon the era is pretty 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.180
 well and well this one generally I liked it 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.880
 quite the game yes this the truth if 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.800
 I recommend them to me in qualification 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.310
 would give an 8 the truth our good 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.590
 deserved perhaps 85 and then to this one them 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.150
 I repeat you have to play several 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.010
 games not only froze the truth 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.590
 that's wrong they have to try several 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.560
 things and so they will have like a 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.910
 better not liked selection they are not going to 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.460
 to be able to give a better opinion about what 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.280
 this game is good or bad the game if 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.930
 it's good but if you boil it 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.970
 blood play with the buttocks you get fed up 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.850
 shit on you so do not play the game 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.500
 you're not going to like it and I know what 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.900
 they say it's that they kill you very easy and 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.610
 that's number one here you're not a 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.590
 Spartan you want a common soldier and 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.630
 current the truth number 2 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.720
 this is a different game this is 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.240
 located in 2025 and helen the 2 thousand 557 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.700
 halo 4 is already in this year we can not 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.040
 compare them the truth everyone has what 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 yours and everyone does their thing in a way 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.160
 Excellent 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.390
 if you agassi that they kill you very 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.600
 fast and that then in what game do not you 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.940
 kill tell me I do not kill you there are 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.770
 many campers with him killed me and that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.260
 game there is no campero whether that's 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.360
 other games 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.160
 and also another thing is that call of duty 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.960
 revolutionized in call of duty 4 modern 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.300
 warfare that was good for infinity 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.130
 ward and those things we can see that 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.680
 are fixed between the 4 in games with 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.289
 garfield too 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.330
 so if it's worth the game, it's going 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.580
 to like if they are half undecided and 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.919
 buy what is not good I would 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.270
 I recommend that they feel it and a very 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.669
 important that you are already forgetting is 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.400
 the zombie mode that is terrific the 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.320
 truth that's the truth pretty good 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.690
 that point that has another zombie mode 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.370
 since it is there to survive and 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.620
 survive the waves of attacks by the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.690
 living dead 'along with their three 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.750
 best friends and now as many as seven 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:58.229
 friends more that the truth is very very 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.820
 good fuck the video is going to end 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.620
 I hope you liked it I will be 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.380
 uploading more videos of call of duty 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.610
 black ops' shows and also of thread 4 not 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.099
 they start to tell him that I'm just going to 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.479
 upload that tomorrow tomorrow same 10 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.949
 December I will upload the tours of 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.800
 the three new maps of the package 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.330
 funny if you liked the video 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.820
 let me like it and tell me what 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.870
 I think I see them on another occasion to Tommy 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.870
 over and out
