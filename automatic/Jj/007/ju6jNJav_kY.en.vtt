00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 god first took another question what 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.310
 for music off-road car 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.710
 I can now again in between 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 john to put more content on man bakkal 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.200
 is back again for the fourth season 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.450
 at psv 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.370
 after he invaded the woods and Eindhoven 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 Twente immediately arrived where he was the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.789
 first place in the first three seasons 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.109
 did he have to do this particular season 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.850
 with raids 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.439
 also rich top man bakkal the last few weeks 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.420
 again more playing time and stress it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 I still played in the to I am I 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 also been a mistake to make the server old and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.179
 when another boys go and go 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.279
 Then you just know that you say beware 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 make the place 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.340
 but well you certainly know scared 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
 club like psv that moment we so i one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 and the last last week 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 indeed we look more or more 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 against FC Utrecht it was hanging on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.800
 on the right, but otman fired that up too 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.379
 play left as a number 10 or as 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.399
 one of the controlling midfielder 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.469
 during the preparation of the people 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.100
 season is even once as right back 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.410
 tested 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 seems to be the ideal position for the cold 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.289
 not to exist 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.609
 well i guess i just put that on 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.410
 the midfield from the feet can be one 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.850
 the whole match is more offensive 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 checking other times is just like me 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 ask for me i do not have myself either 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 really a distinct population shows 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.270
 it as an advantage was a disadvantage that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.729
 versatility of yours yes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.799
 aka we both go as far as they do 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.549
 positive view then I would be there 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.930
 for the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.450
 on which man buck like me at the moment 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.950
 slightly more in the anonymity which is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 his friend and teammate are everyone 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 afellay full of interest 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.619
 a possible departure of the midfielder 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 to FC Barcelona is also in the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.229
 player group with interest and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.229
 admiration followed 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.619
 today with denyo karlovasi 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.729
 If you consider bastion at this time 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.369
 that best football and high tide wilders 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.659
 think you can argue 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 and if you like that guy from soccer and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.350
 then I guess that's just that idea 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.030
 that Christ the walk is sometimes quite 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.580
 nice for that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.880
 but they are both Moroccan 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.140
 origin come from the own youth of psv 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 prefer to play in midfield 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.670
 but took bakakkal and ibrahim afellay 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.259
 are totally different as a footballer 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.299
 departure of the latter 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.610
 former summer once a spot on 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.470
 the midfield for 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.319
 weeks mix of new toes 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.230
 counting in football knows his honor 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.550
 go for it and arrow would hurt day of 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.940
 Then such a career always runs 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.430
 different so i started own thing and i will 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.350
 i just have to make sure i have one 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.820
 meet 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.620
 Sibir road then comes and the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.810
 places fifth can get clean 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.720
 don't start looking at me there first 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.940
 next Saturday ajax psv 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.010
 a topper in the netherlands the eindhovenaren 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.390
 won their last two duels while 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.090
 ajax to last two duels in the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 PSV has now lost the league 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.470
 chance to hurt the Amsterdammers and 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.330
 put behind nine points 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.220
 do you use blood then you will 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.970
 succeed because it is actually a bit 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.680
 crisis is well I am the results 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.350
 are not really busy there 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.820
 well and on the other hand I try for minutes 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.070
 then it's holding a beast that is 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.710
 not as it should do and as one 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.800
 there is also no where must pre-grass 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.090
 and give and then we can have a positive 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.910
 charge 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.810
 Otman Bakal has played 6 so far 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.520
 competition duels against ajax 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.830
 he won the three and played none 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.660
 equal but the most striking is that 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.940
 there are already 4 balls from his foot in the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.290
 doors flew and if buck if right then 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.290
 white psv from ajax 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.480
 remember that a space trip I think 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.870
 that balance are positive and close from 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.910
 my goals in terms that certainly yes 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.160
 so yes I do have my goals 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.090
 mega pack the riser 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.090
 what was the nicest of you 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.550
 yes i think that is an arena of that though 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.780
 nice stadium to get he was too 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.530
 still the champion year the last 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.530
 champion janice 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.310

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.780
