00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello myself vilsakom and today I will tell 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 about the case that I usually use 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.200
 from the times i bought the blue version let's 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.120
 open it let's see what's in the box 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.639
 I'll tell you why other covers 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 not as good as this one and why sena 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 ultraslim is really worth it 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.279
 he hunts and so easy to get this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.279
 cover drove 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.109
 first of all pay attention to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.449
 the box should look like this 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.640
 This case is on the manufacturer's website 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.860
 30 dollars very often November 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.870
 there are fakes they are packed in 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.340
 other boxes look absolutely not 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.920
 so it is usually cheaper 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.449
 accordingly, if the price on ebay is cheaper 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.220
 than the manufacturer’s website is you 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.350
 should always alert 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.110
 what is interesting in this case it is made 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.210
 from the skin and probably as far as I remember it 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.260
 own company came up with a similar 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.629
 design now you can see 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.570
 almost all stores are very 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.589
 often found inside here lies itself 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:08.100
 the cover there still lay ordinary pieces of paper 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:11.020
 now pulled and that's how it goes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.549
 actually looks like a case made 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.000
 he is really very soft 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.970
 beautiful skin and it is very thin 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.310
 when you when you start it 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.119
 use it turns out to be very thin 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.460
 very pleasant to the touch but he has 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.840
 one big problem the first day 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.330
 when you start it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.610
 use it will be very different and for 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.290
 there to shove your iphone 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.540
 and now he lives with me in this 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.060
 funny sock and this sock from 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.860
 ipod 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.550
 then iphone now looks like it could 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.190
 see a video about changing its panels 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.229
 it's really hard to shove 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 gets stuck it fell so tight but 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.180
 it goes literally through for some 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.690
 while operating your iphone starts 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.650
 living is very easy and many me 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.990
 ask maybe it makes sense 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.060
 buy version with elevator you know yes 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.159
 here such a thing is pulled out i don't 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.659
 supporter of such things 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.549
 ok he pops out of here and 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.000
 common problems do not happen like this 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.140
 press poems from the bottom and I left 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.319
 using you only for carrying 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.989
 for example, when you drag your iphone into 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.510
 pocket somewhere in the bag because i 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.970
 I think that he still scratches there 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.310
 no matter how you want to fight white iphone you 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.349
 remember yes i am just that’s why 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.150
 changed the panels just wiped and 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.160
 there were scratches on the screen although it is not 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.140
 subject to say very simple 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.959
 scratching but nonetheless however i 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.909
 oppose all sorts of 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.170
 films because they make a sense of 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.209
 using the phone is not very 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.829
 comfortable cheap also closes 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.319
 the sensor so you will not 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.290
 disconnect iphone during a call 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.030
 it's not very nice and protect it 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.010
 somehow you need big and bulky covers 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.560
 that cover the whole phone to me too 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.000
 I do not like because they change experience 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.730
 communicating with the phone from him 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.260
 design with its iron and glass but 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.629
 I think such covers are optimal 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.489
 option and they do not affect himself 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.349
 device design but protect 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.780
 its in moments of carrying it is great 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.549
 terms since buying such a case 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.190
 For example hard, too, from leather, too, not 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.159
 cheap and you know 100 of course he 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.379
 somehow that's not it not because he 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.870
 very hard and somehow I didn’t like 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.180
 in the end I wanted to have some kind of hole here 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.840
 at night stupid what else to tell you about 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.970
 hay fakes very often this thing 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.799
 not stitched see here such 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.220
 special line which is inside too 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.989
 passes and if there is no line this 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.909
 here's the inner fiber starts 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.549
 peel off and then directly 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:46.209
 abs skin case and so you have 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.919
 there will be such rags I had a white not 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.329
 original case sena first he 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.609
 very quickly became dirty but it 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.109
 the problem of all the covers but at the same time he 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.879
 and exfoliated and began to use it 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.980
 absolutely impossible so here such 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.680
 Here are the covers, in principle, I advise you to take and 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.049
 for now, for some reason, many who make hay 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.870
 We in Russia are not particularly fond of retailers for 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.329
 possible because expensive is usually all the same 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.010
 promised it all so again not someone 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.959
 writes but generally I will say goodbye to you 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.780

 iphone without all or respect anyway 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.709
