00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Yup 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.180
 others who are there have clashed with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.630
 this new video brings you a 226 kill 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.550
 not age 227 now I don't know for sure 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.000
 I'm here with another one that I took shape 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.129
 a double that the rest is also the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
 second comments in a row that face 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.940
 on the same day I will remember it now 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 each commented video you will see for 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.160
 make you understand how many commented in a row 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.840
 because for the uninitiated they are in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.420
 vacation and nothing told me I read a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.130
 under the comments of the video I had to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 asked in topics we requested of 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.450
 tell you about the sensations I had 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.360
 in my first game of cod 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.719
 it's a pretty weird question and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.670
 difficult to answer since it is not 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.979
 that you remember me very much in mine 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 first parts of cod 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 I can only firstly apologize for 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.130
 new for colds matt always it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 same day pines or this nasato mi 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.160
 it is exploding and if sometimes there is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 I swear on unconsciously I apologize 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.900
 again, however, I can only do it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 say as an initiative to play string 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.549
 why else he didn't know 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.610
 and then let's say my impressions now 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.340
 sensations just isn't that in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.710
 you remember too much and I wouldn't even know it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 write to tell the truth I still 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 I started playing cod 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.500
 if I'm not mistaken when there was still mv two 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.540
 I don't know if I'm right for two years or 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.729
 I can't tell you one here at all 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.770
 period however there was still m2 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.500
 I still didn't have a playstation 3 and well 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 we went to sleep at an enemy that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.710
 a stop a week ago 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 in practice they value Luciano at the xbox 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.780
 360 when we went there every once in a while 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.409
 they played a little game somewhat mv two 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.619
 precisely in private and 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.300
 let's say he was 10 times better 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.840
 of us therefore also lucas till score 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.120
 but play at the beginning and nothing then 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.160
 playing in private is not that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.269
 sensations could be that much 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.680
 the sources if he had played online 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.480
 Black probably suck 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.830
 because every time you start a 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.080
 playing a game is not for nothing 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.670
 capable and I would not have liked 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.920
 sincerely go online and not understand each other 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 no series below even though 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.870
 they also did it privately, see that 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.980
 we also played 5 6 and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.989
 friends got all shared screen 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.269
 so you can imagine divided tv 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.280
 in four how much we understood anyway 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.900
 my first impressions were that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.670
 it was a fun game for sure not 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.379
 I never thought I'd get to 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.849
 use it to make a youtube channel 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.310
 sincerely not have a purchase of 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.410
 play with it so much, but nothing is 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.450
 liked is some impresta to finish 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.920
 so I hope the comments lived 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.569
 both so I am interested not short like and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.000
