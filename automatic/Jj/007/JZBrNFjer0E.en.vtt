 I'm busy with something like that. 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:07.810
 Moreover, rattling think a lot of work after retirement in the fact that the British season 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:11.710
 If you look a little bit like a watch, 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.780
 Kerr is at home. I do not like to go out there. 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.470

 But when you talk about studying the lifting of rice or father or rattling 2,000 seats 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.229
 As a player, Park Sung-Bae is very sick 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.040

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:46.079
 Because the last two years 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.079
 I do not have a lot of fun with you. 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:55.149
 This time, I was going to film the cover of the FIFA Online string , 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:00.789
 When you enjoy the game room so took to heart what 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:05.710
 There was a semicircle, a part where you could enjoy the blessings in other ways. 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:10.149
 Things that can not happen in the real world can be 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.569
 I like it a lot because of the parts with the numbers. 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.100
 This time the correspondent is in the living room. 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.730

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.420
 Yes, I cut it . 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.690
 When you can bless your stats 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.030
 I have to coordinate with the game. 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 I 'll tell you to give me a lift. 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 What little I now have the looks of you so let's do something about food distribution level 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.810
 I can swear at many people, but I need to apply it to that extent. 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.260
 I think we should have a cover model and video 7 , 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.129
 What was captain garage 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.840
 The team will return to what one can achieve all the birds in the game 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.630
 How that happened genie out of the game in the garage, I estimate that the online store 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.850
 To show 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.960
 I thought it would be a good chance to control something like that 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.130
 Sometimes when I did not show the biography of the national team, I came in. 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.470
 It's a battalion. So we do not want to be bus- tapped and open. 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.150
 - I wish I was good. 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.140
 I just like that, of course. 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.430
 But I am really wondering why I write not because when Fort departure 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.730
 I did not spend a little look at the past, the conclusion to ask the sentence because one 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.319
 I wrote the details. 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.319
 Chris those three I 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.340
 Because of the not so think 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.340
