00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
her tail it's kind of cooled down

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.280 
her tail it's kind of cooled down
because<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.270> kind<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.630> cold<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.140> house

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
because it's kind of cold in my house

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.830 
because it's kind of cold in my house
today<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> pink<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.030> fading<00:01:57.450> away<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
today and so the pink is fading away a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.929 
today and so the pink is fading away a
little<00:01:58.110> bit<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.829> green<00:01:59.219> color<00:01:59.640> so

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
little bit you can see a green color so

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.420 
little bit you can see a green color so
it<00:02:00.000> almost<00:02:00.090> looks<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.799> her<00:02:01.799> tail<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it almost looks like her tail is kind of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
it almost looks like her tail is kind of
resting<00:02:02.820> over<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.240> something<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> little

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
resting over or something it's a little

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
resting over or something it's a little
weird<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.560> let's<00:02:04.680> put<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.070> some<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.520> warm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
water there we go

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.230 
water there we go
we<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.649> back<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.160> pee

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
we are back to pee

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.090 
we are back to pee
looks<00:02:09.600> really<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:09.960> so<00:02:10.020> she's<00:02:10.440> outside<00:02:10.830> it'll

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
looks really good so she's outside it'll

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.220 
looks really good so she's outside it'll
stay<00:02:11.310> pink<00:02:11.580> very<00:02:11.850> well<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.510> you're<00:02:12.690> inside

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
stay pink very well but if you're inside

stay pink very well but if you're inside
and<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.590> cold<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:15.840> probably

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and it's cold then it would probably

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.570 
and it's cold then it would probably
turn<00:02:16.290> back<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> green<00:02:16.740> pretty<00:02:16.950> quick<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.430> let
