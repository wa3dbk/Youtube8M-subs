00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.299 
gaming setup because some people don't
like<00:00:12.540> long<00:00:12.809> videos<00:00:12.840> which<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.469> fine<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> like

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
like long videos which is fine so I like

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.120 
like long videos which is fine so I like
to<00:00:14.340> give<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.700> option<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.480> viewers<00:00:16.130> so

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
to give that option to my viewers so

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.500 
to give that option to my viewers so
let's<00:00:17.340> go<00:00:17.430> ahead<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.670> sit<00:00:17.820> down<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.210> look<00:00:18.449> at

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
let's go ahead and sit down and look at

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.570 
let's go ahead and sit down and look at
what<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.720> got<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.279> starting<00:00:20.279> from<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> left

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
what we got here starting from the left

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
what we got here starting from the left
here<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.330> actually<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.660> actual<00:00:22.230> gaming

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
here this is actually the actual gaming

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.060 
here this is actually the actual gaming
setup<00:00:22.949> mainly<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.359> odd<00:00:25.070> obviously

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
setup mainly this is the odd obviously

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
setup mainly this is the odd obviously
this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> gaming<00:00:26.789> rig<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.109> Xbox

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
this is the gaming rig it's not an Xbox

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.609 
this is the gaming rig it's not an Xbox
that's<00:00:29.099> pretty<00:00:29.310> obvious<00:00:30.109> but<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that's pretty obvious but this is the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
that's pretty obvious but this is the
rig<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.180> random

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
rig down here and I have some random

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.060 
rig down here and I have some random
strobe<00:00:33.840> lights<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.290> imma<00:00:34.590> turn<00:00:34.710> those<00:00:34.920> off

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
strobe lights on so imma turn those off

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
strobe lights on so imma turn those off
I'm<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.610> turn<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.210> white<00:00:36.420> light

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
I'm gonna turn them to like white light

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
I'm gonna turn them to like white light
and<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> looks<00:00:37.649> good

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and it looks good

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.520 
and it looks good
so<00:00:39.149> down<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> rig<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> rig<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
so down that is the rig and the rig is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.670 
so down that is the rig and the rig is
over<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> specs<00:00:41.399> real<00:00:41.579> quick<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
over the specs real quick this is a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.209 
over the specs real quick this is a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
EVGA you see them over there

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.310 
EVGA you see them over there
super<00:00:49.800> clock<00:00:50.010> +<00:00:50.280> edition<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> they're<00:00:52.020> pretty

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
super clock + edition so they're pretty

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
super clock + edition so they're pretty
pretty<00:00:52.800> beefy<00:00:53.100> graphics<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> need

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
pretty beefy graphics there you need

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
pretty beefy graphics there you need
that<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> triple<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> slice<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.760> also

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that for the triple to slice this also

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.950 
that for the triple to slice this also

processor<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> me<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> lot<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> video

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
processor not to me a lot of video

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.460 
processor not to me a lot of video
rendering<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:03.989> anything<00:01:04.199> too

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
rendering so I don't need anything too

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190 
rendering so I don't need anything too
insane<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> would<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> nicer

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
insane but I would like to have a nicer

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
insane but I would like to have a nicer
processor<00:01:07.680> than<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.979> that'd<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.610> great<00:01:08.850> but

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
processor than that that'd be great but

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
processor than that that'd be great but
really<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.290> much<00:01:10.439> other<00:01:10.560> thing<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
are V 2 7 8 cues on the side the one in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
are V 2 7 8 cues on the side the one in
the<00:01:41.579> middle<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> higher<00:01:42.450> contrast

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the middle I think is a higher contrast

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.389 
the middle I think is a higher contrast
ratio<00:01:43.490> by<00:01:44.490> 40<00:01:45.000> million<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.290> whereas<00:01:47.220> these

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
ratio by 40 million to one whereas these

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
ratio by 40 million to one whereas these
ones<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> 10<00:01:48.060> million<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.049> not

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
there are LED lights under there so I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.780 
there are LED lights under there so I
can<00:02:51.880> do<00:02:51.970> things<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:53.550> change<00:02:54.550> through

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
can do things like this change through

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.010 
can do things like this change through
all<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> might<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.330> fade<00:02:55.630> between<00:02:55.990> a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
all the might have a fade between a

all the might have a fade between a
bunch<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.350> colors<00:02:56.710> I<00:02:56.980> can<00:02:57.580> have<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:57.850> flash

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
bunch of colors I can have it like flash

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.970 
bunch of colors I can have it like flash
and<00:02:58.510> strobe<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.110> things<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.860> it's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
and strobe and things like that so it's

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.830 
and strobe and things like that so it's
pretty<00:03:00.100> cool<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.610> usually<00:03:01.240> keep<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:01.600> either

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840

why<00:04:58.139> because<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.860> think<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.220> Mac<00:04:59.550> editing

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
why because I think that Mac editing

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.780 
why because I think that Mac editing
software<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:00.900> much<00:05:01.110> more<00:05:01.350> intuitive<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.010> it's

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
software is much more intuitive and it's

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.390 
software is much more intuitive and it's
a<00:05:02.820> lot<00:05:03.030> easier<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.570> use<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:04.560> get<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.860> results<00:05:05.310> I

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
a lot easier to use to get the results I

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.760 
a lot easier to use to get the results I
want<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.210> be<00:05:06.930> honest<00:05:07.290> you're<00:05:07.560> not<00:05:07.680> gonna

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
want and to be honest you're not gonna

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.800 
want and to be honest you're not gonna
get<00:05:07.979> much<00:05:08.160> better<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.610> result<00:05:08.970> on<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.270> PC
