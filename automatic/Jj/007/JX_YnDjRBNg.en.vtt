00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
fighting back and working hard to get

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
fighting back and working hard to get
back<00:01:17.520> from<00:01:17.700> injury<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.210> saw<00:01:18.630> him<00:01:18.720> three<00:01:18.930> times

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
back from injury I saw him three times

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
back from injury I saw him three times
after<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:20.400> returned<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.880> thought<00:01:21.060> he<00:01:21.119> played

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
after he returned I thought he played

after he returned I thought he played
very<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.869> thought<00:01:22.049> his<00:01:22.170> conditioning<00:01:22.680> was

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
very well I thought his conditioning was

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
very well I thought his conditioning was
fantastic<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.820> player<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.210> had<00:01:24.570> not

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
fantastic for a player that had not

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
fantastic for a player that had not
played<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.049> year<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.549> he<00:01:26.670> threw

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
played all year and you know he threw

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.060 
played all year and you know he threw
himself<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:27.299> into<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> mix<00:01:28.380> I've<00:01:28.590> seen

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

to you and and this scares me a little
bit<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> pull<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
bit for me if I was going to pull the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.030 
bit for me if I was going to pull the
trigger<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:57.119> GM<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.140> KHL<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
trigger as GM with that KHL in the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010 
trigger as GM with that KHL in the
background<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.119> saying<00:02:00.270> he's<00:02:00.810> going

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
background and I'm not saying he's going

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.899 
background and I'm not saying he's going
there<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.460> there's<00:02:02.700> always

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
there but I just think there's always

there but I just think there's always
that<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.450> factor<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.200> him<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.469> this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that little factor and for him at this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
that little factor and for him at this
seems<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.670> prominent<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.270> some

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
seems a little more prominent for some

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
seems a little more prominent for some
