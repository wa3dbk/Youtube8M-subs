alright<00:00:03.899> we<00:00:03.990> gotta<00:00:04.170> cicada<00:00:04.589> laying<00:00:04.980> eggs<00:00:07.220> in

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
alright we gotta cicada laying eggs in

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:27.330 
alright we gotta cicada laying eggs in
captivity<00:00:13.280> using<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> lb<00:00:14.670> posture

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.460 

now<00:00:27.970> I'm<00:00:28.120> not<00:00:28.270> sure<00:00:28.300> she's<00:00:28.750> done<00:00:29.050> or<00:00:29.380> if<00:00:29.500> she's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
now I'm not sure she's done or if she's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.490 
now I'm not sure she's done or if she's
picking<00:00:32.470> up<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.920> go<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.460> different<00:00:34.500> okay

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
picking up to go to a different okay

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.080 
picking up to go to a different okay
she's<00:00:35.710> going<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:35.950> use<00:00:36.190> she's<00:00:36.700> going<00:00:36.850> to<00:00:36.940> go<00:00:37.030> to

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
she's going to use she's going to go to

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.140 
she's going to use she's going to go to
a<00:00:37.180> different<00:00:37.390> spot<00:00:37.690> on<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.050> branch<00:00:42.150> these

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
a different spot on the branch these

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.000 
a different spot on the branch these
things<00:00:43.480> will<00:00:43.629> use<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:43.840> lv<00:00:44.290> posture<00:00:44.770> and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
things will use that lv posture and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.860 
things will use that lv posture and
they'll<00:00:45.190> make<00:00:45.220> several<00:00:45.879> incisions<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:46.840> the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
they'll make several incisions in the

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.710 
they'll make several incisions in the
branch<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.699> they'll<00:00:48.699> lay<00:00:48.879> several<00:00:49.150> sets<00:00:49.570> of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
branch and they'll lay several sets of

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.119 
branch and they'll lay several sets of
egg<00:00:49.900> cases<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:53.050> really<00:00:53.199> interesting<00:00:53.650> that

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
egg cases it's really interesting that

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.979 
egg cases it's really interesting that
these<00:00:54.400> are<00:00:54.610> doing<00:00:54.820> it<00:00:54.940> in<00:00:55.000> captivity<00:00:55.449> this<00:00:55.840> is

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
these are doing it in captivity this is

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.660 
these are doing it in captivity this is
about<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.410> fourth<00:00:56.680> one<00:00:56.980> that<00:00:57.160> I've<00:00:57.250> had<00:00:57.489> do

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
about the fourth one that I've had do

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.479 
about the fourth one that I've had do
this<00:01:01.110> once<00:01:02.110> she<00:01:02.350> gets<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.739> good<00:01:02.920> groove<00:01:03.220> in<00:01:03.399> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
this once she gets a good groove in the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.070 
this once she gets a good groove in the
branch<00:01:03.730> she'll<00:01:04.059> start<00:01:04.330> depositing<00:01:04.570> eggs

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
branch she'll start depositing eggs

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.880 
branch she'll start depositing eggs
again<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:07.649> have<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:09.070> hear<00:01:09.310> that<00:01:09.490> are<00:01:09.580> mating<00:01:09.940> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.020 

mean<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:14.979> fact<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.280> these<00:01:15.460> are<00:01:15.640> captive

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
mean the fact that these are captive

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.270 
mean the fact that these are captive
doesn't<00:01:16.330> seem<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.570> bother<00:01:16.690> them<00:01:16.930> at<00:01:17.170> all<00:01:17.290> these

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
doesn't seem to bother them at all these

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.130 
doesn't seem to bother them at all these
are<00:01:18.520> all<00:01:19.649> 13<00:01:20.649> years<00:01:20.860> cicadas<00:01:21.990> they're<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
are all 13 years cicadas they're the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.590 
are all 13 years cicadas they're the
cast<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:23.680> species<00:01:24.250> which<00:01:24.610> would<00:01:24.820> be<00:01:24.970> magic

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
cast and I species which would be magic

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.680 
cast and I species which would be magic
eight<00:01:25.869> at<00:01:26.050> tre<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.440> cast<00:01:26.770> an<00:01:26.920> eye<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.270> 13

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
eight at tre to cast an eye for the 13

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.690 
eight at tre to cast an eye for the 13
year<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.350> given<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:32.709> these<00:01:32.950> two<00:01:33.190> are<00:01:33.220> mating

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
year so given that these two are mating

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.639 
year so given that these two are mating
probably<00:01:34.330> will<00:01:34.479> see<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:34.959> female<00:01:35.440> laying

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
probably will see this female laying

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:45.310 
probably will see this female laying
eggs<00:01:35.979> soon<00:01:37.050> go<00:01:38.050> back<00:01:38.229> up<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.530> branch<00:01:38.800> here

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.560 

and<00:01:46.320> again<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.340> her<00:01:47.549> starting<00:01:48.479> to

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and again you can see her starting to

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.340 
and again you can see her starting to
cut<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.049> branch<00:01:49.289> now<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.570> OB<00:01:54.899> posture

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
cut into the branch now the OB posture

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.539 
cut into the branch now the OB posture
is<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.679> black<00:01:56.069> structure<00:01:57.979> that's<00:01:58.979> coming<00:01:59.399> out

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
is the black structure that's coming out

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.139 
is the black structure that's coming out
of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.819> middle<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> abdomen<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:05.149> at

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
of the middle of the abdomen there at

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.850 
of the middle of the abdomen there at
the<00:02:06.329> tip<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> abdomen<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> actual

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the tip of the abdomen is the actual

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.479 
the tip of the abdomen is the actual
capsule<00:02:08.369> where<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.640> eggs<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:08.970> stored<00:02:16.489> and

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
capsule where the eggs are stored and

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.009 
capsule where the eggs are stored and
this<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.880> how<00:02:18.060> they'll<00:02:18.269> do<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.660> wild

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
this is how they'll do it in the wild

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.930 
this is how they'll do it in the wild
now<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.410> wild<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:19.890> actually<00:02:20.430> damages

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
now in the wild this actually damages

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.490 
now in the wild this actually damages
the<00:02:21.090> branch<00:02:23.329> and<00:02:24.329> where<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.380> are<00:02:25.470> large

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the branch and where there are large

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.289 
the branch and where there are large
numbers<00:02:26.069> these<00:02:26.280> insects<00:02:26.880> you'll<00:02:27.060> actually

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
numbers these insects you'll actually

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.190 
numbers these insects you'll actually
see<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.750> outer<00:02:27.900> branches<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> tree<00:02:28.980> died

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
see the outer branches of the tree died

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.569 
see the outer branches of the tree died
after<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> cicadas<00:02:31.769> are<00:02:31.860> gone<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.370> they<00:02:32.430> call

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
after the cicadas are gone and they call

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.990 
after the cicadas are gone and they call
it<00:02:32.700> flagging<00:02:33.180> damage<00:02:34.250> doesn't<00:02:35.250> kill<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.730> tree

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
it flagging damage doesn't kill the tree

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.650 
it flagging damage doesn't kill the tree
but<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.269> looks<00:02:36.450> ugly<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.079> few<00:02:37.440> weeks<00:02:41.660> these

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
but it looks ugly for a few weeks these

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:55.280 
but it looks ugly for a few weeks these
are<00:02:42.810> all<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.110> cast<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.620> species

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.140 

these<00:02:55.920> were<00:02:56.099> collected<00:02:57.140> near<00:02:58.140> Hardy<00:02:58.530> Arkansas

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
these were collected near Hardy Arkansas

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.789 
these were collected near Hardy Arkansas
just<00:03:00.150> south<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.540> Hardy<00:03:00.840> Arkansas<00:03:01.319> along<00:03:01.590> the

South Fork of the spring river go back

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.289 
South Fork of the spring river go back
turn<00:03:12.810> mating<00:03:13.170> pair<00:03:13.409> here<00:03:13.709> they<00:03:14.220> here<00:03:14.489> they<00:03:14.790> are

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.819 
turn mating pair here they here they are
really<00:03:15.810> getting<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:22.109> these<00:03:22.260> two<00:03:22.470> actually

really getting on and these two actually

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.379 
really getting on and these two actually
a<00:03:22.859> lot<00:03:23.010> more<00:03:23.069> animated<00:03:23.609> than<00:03:23.760> most<00:03:24.030> mating

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
a lot more animated than most mating

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.229 
a lot more animated than most mating
pairs<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:24.719> I've<00:03:24.900> seen<00:03:25.170> these<00:03:25.439> are<00:03:26.239> yeah

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
pairs that I've seen these are yeah
