this<00:03:11.950> one<00:03:12.130> here<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.870> I'm<00:03:13.870> holding<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:15.489> goes

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
this one here that I'm holding just goes

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.059 
this one here that I'm holding just goes
on<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:15.970> back<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.800> other<00:03:17.920> one

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
on the back there and then the other one

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.350 
on the back there and then the other one
with<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.280> fuel<00:03:18.519> filter<00:03:19.030> also<00:03:20.580> all<00:03:21.580> plugged

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
with the fuel filter also all plugged

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.030 
with the fuel filter also all plugged
back<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:23.080> there<00:03:24.060> I'll<00:03:25.060> show<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.680> these<00:03:26.680> ones

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
back on there I'll show you these ones

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.650 
back on there I'll show you these ones
that<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.910> was<00:03:28.150> doing<00:03:28.450> earlier<00:03:29.790> there<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
that I was doing earlier there with the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.620 
that I was doing earlier there with the
wire<00:03:32.310> those<00:03:33.310> were<00:03:33.519> all<00:03:33.640> plugged<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.090> night<00:03:34.420> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
wire those were all plugged in night the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.330 
wire those were all plugged in night the
tank<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.140> slides<00:03:35.500> back<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.880> off<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:39.069> hooked

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
tank it slides back and off it's hooked

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.410 
tank it slides back and off it's hooked
off<00:03:39.489> at<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.730> front<00:03:40.000> there

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
off at the front there

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.809 
off at the front there
so<00:03:40.930> it's<00:03:41.080> backing<00:03:41.470> off<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.459> then<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.640> comes

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
so it's backing off and then it comes

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.800 
so it's backing off and then it comes
back<00:03:43.030> into<00:03:43.269> rest<00:03:43.540> into<00:03:43.840> place<00:03:45.360> with<00:03:46.860> two

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
back into rest into place with two

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.990 
back into rest into place with two
rubber<00:03:49.810> mounts<00:03:50.700> actually<00:03:51.700> got<00:03:51.790> them<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
rubber mounts actually got them the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.530 
rubber mounts actually got them the
wrong<00:03:52.090> way<00:03:52.120> around

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
wrong way around

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.420 
wrong way around
let's<00:03:53.290> go<00:03:53.519> underneath<00:03:54.989> there<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:57.069> then<00:03:57.130> with

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
let's go underneath there and then with

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.920 
let's go underneath there and then with
your<00:03:57.549> bolt<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.290> down<00:03:59.620> on<00:04:00.400> top<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:01.540> hold<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.870> in

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
your bolt and down on top to hold it in

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.460 
your bolt and down on top to hold it in
place<00:04:03.299> alright<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:04.600> there<00:04:05.019> we<00:04:05.109> are<00:04:05.140> then

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
place alright so there we are then

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.830 
place alright so there we are then
that's<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.950> fuel<00:04:06.310> tap<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:06.790> back<00:04:07.180> into<00:04:07.420> place

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
that's the fuel tap and back into place

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.870 
that's the fuel tap and back into place
as<00:04:08.500> well<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:10.060> only<00:04:10.209> goes<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.660> one<00:04:10.720> way<00:04:11.200> as<00:04:11.880> it's

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
as well it only goes on one way as it's

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.560 
as well it only goes on one way as it's
like<00:04:13.060> those<00:04:13.239> three<00:04:14.019> square<00:04:14.380> edges<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.010> then<00:04:15.160> a

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
like those three square edges and then a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.819 
like those three square edges and then a
curved<00:04:16.570> edge<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.229> can't<00:04:17.470> pull<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.680> on<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
curved edge so you can't pull it on the

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.360 
curved edge so you can't pull it on the
wrong<00:04:18.039> way<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:19.350> we'll<00:04:20.350> bolt<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.769> back<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.190> and

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
wrong way and we'll bolt it back on and

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.409 
wrong way and we'll bolt it back on and
so<00:04:22.210> that's<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.690> tank<00:04:23.200> nice<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.680> secure

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
so that's a tank nice and secure

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.710 
so that's a tank nice and secure
no<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:26.289> that's<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.789> all<00:04:27.789> done<00:04:27.850> don't<00:04:28.690> forget
