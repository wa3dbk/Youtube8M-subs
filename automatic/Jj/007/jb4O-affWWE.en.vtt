00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello my name is thought yesterday have 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.230
 I mean my two carpenters center on the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
 wood and crafts to nuremberg 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 taken on the opening day 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.500
 we were hoping it would be tomorrow 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 not quite so full 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 Unfortunately that was look to chris 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.970
 nevertheless proppevoll 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.670
 we arrived very early so that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.070
 we were one of the first in the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.160
 the halls were in it 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.289
 I had already read before 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.420
 had interesting things for me 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.100
 and that 's why I am through the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.410
 Most of them are actually humming relatively 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.360
 quickly through 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 at the fittings and hinges and 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.610
 drawer systems 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.800
 I have a while there 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.440
 lingered and looked at me but 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.879
 otherwise I'm pretty purposeful 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.510
 gone to hall 12 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.670
 So there were the most 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 to find power tools 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 marien hand tools the same with me 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.860
 fit into the workshop because it was 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.700
 So many things there for the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 industry and for big ones 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.479
 craft shops so machines that way 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 great as you are sometimes almost home 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.880
 say so in the hall 12 could 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.090
 you then all famous manufacturers 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 find and what I thought was great 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 So most machines can work in too 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 take the hand and try it 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.729
 So I have a lot of Mr. Marc 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.770
 screwed drilled sawn honed 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.200
 and picked up 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.630
 so it was mine 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.329
 great thing that you really get it all 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.189
 can try 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.679
 in addition, at two stands I also on 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 wanted to visit every case that 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.890
 Dieter schmidt and that one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.950
 thickening and how festool normal 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.020
 others, of course, have them too 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:08.849
 made demonstrations and at the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 pockets with was so the program sls 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.620
 and since I already have the ultra light 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 system has the theme very similar but 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.650
 I wanted to be smaller - necessarily 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.380
 look at 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.959
 then has a dedicated englander 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.269
 demonstrated great and yes otherwise 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:31.200
 The choice of things they were there 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.090
 we did not have that great 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.390
 all important things were great 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.940
 as you have seen so close to the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.700
 stalls were really proppevoll 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:49.680
 and it was the workbench bird bank 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.730
 New York then go with the bands 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.980
 So forces days that is exactly 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 looked at especially this lay knows that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.170
 I actually only ever had it 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.350
 on pictures in books and on the internet 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.410
 viewed 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.030
 so that was nice that one in the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.709
 could also take a look 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.190
 could see if it really like that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.459
 sorry for a long time, and it does 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.660
 that was also a great story 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.030
 I was very early in the beginning 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.920
 even the dieter had a schmidt 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.060
 little time to slip with us 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.139
 have each other a bit 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.849
 exchanged 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.300
 I think he has me a bit 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.590
 Above all, however, having smiled smiled 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.710
 it was still a nice one 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.290
 history and yes I have then easy 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.720
 added a few impressions 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.940
 from hall 12 and I hope so 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.060
 like you was of course that's the whole thing 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.860
 not completely can not be 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.310
 And it should not be too long 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.310

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.559
