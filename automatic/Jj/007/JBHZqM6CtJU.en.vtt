00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.119 

we're<00:00:45.510> talking<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:45.899> bear<00:00:46.469> hunting<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
we're talking about bear hunting and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
we're talking about bear hunting and
hunting<00:00:47.309> opportunities<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:48.629> varies

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
hunting opportunities it really varies

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
hunting opportunities it really varies
tremendously<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.949> part<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> state

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
tremendously from one part of the state

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.630 
tremendously from one part of the state
to<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.059> next<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.719> North<00:00:52.410> Georgia<00:00:52.620> our<00:00:53.370> bears

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to the next in North Georgia our bears

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
to the next in North Georgia our bears
depend<00:00:54.149> heavily<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.629> oak<00:00:55.469> acorns<00:00:55.789> basically

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
depend heavily on oak acorns basically

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.250 
depend heavily on oak acorns basically
to<00:00:56.879> give<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.120> through<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> winters<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.989> far

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to give them through the winters as far

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
to give them through the winters as far
as<00:00:58.379> hunting<00:00:58.710> goes<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> plays<00:00:59.640> into

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
as hunting goes and how that plays into

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.869 
as hunting goes and how that plays into
that<00:01:00.089> when<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> failure<00:01:01.549> with<00:01:02.549> our<00:01:02.699> oak

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that when we have a failure with our oak

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
that when we have a failure with our oak
trees<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.479> oak<00:01:03.629> mass<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.500> last<00:01:04.979> year

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
trees in our oak mass which last year

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.300 
trees in our oak mass which last year
2013<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> mass<00:01:06.840> failure<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
2013 was a mass failure when we have a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.249 
2013 was a mass failure when we have a
failure<00:01:08.670> bears<00:01:09.420> tend<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> move

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
failure bears tend to have to move

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.960 
failure bears tend to have to move
around<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.369> they're<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.789> move

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
around a lot more so they're on the move

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.639 
around a lot more so they're on the move
there's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.810> opportunity<00:01:13.619> for

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
there's a lot more opportunity for

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.529 
there's a lot more opportunity for
hunters<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> encounter<00:01:14.490> bears<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
hunters to encounter bears and that's

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.100 
hunters to encounter bears and that's
what<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.840> saw<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.229> fall<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.570> this<00:01:18.570> year<00:01:18.929> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
what we saw that fall but this year it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.180 
what we saw that fall but this year it
appears<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.560> we're<00:01:19.740> gonna<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.070> an

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
appears that we're gonna have an

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.460 
appears that we're gonna have an
abundance<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> acres<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.570> both<00:01:22.200> white

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
abundance of acres and so both white

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
abundance of acres and so both white
oaks<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> red<00:01:23.190> oaks<00:01:23.369> most<00:01:23.789> bears<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.420> most

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
oaks and red oaks most bears like most

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.830 
oaks and red oaks most bears like most
my<00:01:25.050> life<00:01:25.080> prefer<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> white<00:01:26.009> oaks<00:01:26.840> they're

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
my life prefer the white oaks they're

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
my life prefer the white oaks they're
gonna<00:01:27.929> utilize<00:01:28.170> both<00:01:28.619> those<00:01:28.890> types<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> ok

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
gonna utilize both those types of ok

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
gonna utilize both those types of ok
cones<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.390> series<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> different<00:01:31.740> food

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
cones and series and different food

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.279 
cones and series and different food
sources<00:01:32.429> when<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.090> find<00:01:33.330> them<00:01:33.539> so<00:01:33.690> where

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
sources when you can find them so where

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.809 
sources when you can find them so where
hunters<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:35.640> serious

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
hunters get out and do some serious

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.160 
hunters get out and do some serious
scouting<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.569> they'll<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.840> plenty<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
scouting and they'll have plenty of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
scouting and they'll have plenty of
opportunity<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> take<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.039> bear<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.520> it's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
opportunity to take a bear but it's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
opportunity to take a bear but it's
gonna<00:01:38.789> be<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.149> more<00:01:39.300> difficult<00:01:39.569> at<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
gonna be a little more difficult at in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
gonna be a little more difficult at in
