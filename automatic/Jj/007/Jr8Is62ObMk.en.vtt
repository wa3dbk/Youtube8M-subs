00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.740
 something like that is welcome 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.990
 sounded a new video here on the vp 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.580
 may be from my side but before i go 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.770
 come to my topic looks at everyone 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.390
 case the last video from vb but nice 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.770
 really effortless in the video put into it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.630
 here as a new format that has yet 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.820
 no other has made it clear somehow 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 svp news and every week we like that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 Houston of the German community in the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 youtube channel will happen we will 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.479
 it can be quite interesting 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.400
 made fun and looks at it 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.080
 only ever in the case 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.150
 background he sees in the nineties 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.559
 quite often mlb plays with the sgh of 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.809
 Karas is looking forward to seeing you again 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.600
 o2 to comment on because somehow so far 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.799
 last time only aw aw aw and take like 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.930
 I can not see it anymore but 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.370
 that's because everyone sees it differently 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.589
 this funny dress on facebook 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.269
 orders a little freestyle help 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.309
 my further out that is always so 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.500
 as this dress some black blue 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.729
 see and some gold white is somehow 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
 the funny I see that in any case 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.090
 grilled and white do not understand how to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 because some see a different color in it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.310
 it may be weird 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 not quite, but that was all today 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 not my topic is namely in the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.259
 theme should be like you on youtube 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 becomes more successful or how you there 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.789
 a bit more reach a bit 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 more videos and gets and that is 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.100
 I have two points then 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 written down and that should be up 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 follow any case if you stop 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 somehow be more successful on youtube 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.640
 I wanted and yes my first point 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.899
 also may not have written 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.759
 Imagine if the youtube 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.229
 you have you need to even try to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.759
 learn and not somehow other people 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.560
 to do that is not possible 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.390
 because if you make other people 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.460
 then realize that you have your audience that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 you stop anyone thier fields eg 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.399
 which makes lo tricks announcement and then 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.249
 something with scorpion still with 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.450
 what is bata of water 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.490
 others and then cancel 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.960
 you have to try your own rail 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.609
 to drive your own comment style 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 to develop and not somehow others 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.700
 to make people go because that works 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.439
 mostly in trousers that note that and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.240
 then the sea â€‹â€‹rises instead of that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.409
 you kind of hold good resonances 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.750
 do you get the somehow? 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.890
 Comments are good 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.540
 But okay, I was here again 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.220
 if I was stupid enough 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.450
 a second point if I'm on it 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.220
 You need a good one to write 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.160
 picture quality you can not somehow 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.990
 as an example such a bamboo present 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.220
 have and somehow purely speak and 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470
 then try a good one 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 audio quality to get broken 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.280
 good phone needs somehow good 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.870
 Gameplay is her needs good 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.980
 cut program did not really understand 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.200
 hampered here may not cut 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610
 because of the paralyzed fun comment as 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.130
 I've just done that somehow 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.380
 does not really follow disabled 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.640
 Comment unless it's your style 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010
 mine for example i sometimes have 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.600
 my misfire 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.910
 fun aside yours is just a good one 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.800
 have video quality by sharing yours 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.470
 videos in eg in hd render somehow 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.150
 have cool intro or that you 're cool 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.680
 cuts rhine was what the sound effects 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.760
 that's what some people do to you 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.200
 and that can actually happen right 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.000
 such a sound effect or something like that 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.470
 small tip from my side still 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.390
 a little tip you pay attention to 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.890
 if you do not have a 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.560
 good micro so comes to the bus 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.090
 example has a good quality and has 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.590
 but it has a halfway decent 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.120
 So somehow smartphone has today 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.250
 Everybody has somehow in the smartphone 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 apps kanak in africa have the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.269
 smartphones so take your phone 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.470
 really as a sound source where you stop 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.870
 purely speaking that usually has one 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.340
 really good migros and there you can 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.989
 you good comments so join it 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.330
 is not a thing so a comment 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.470
 to record this is really good and so 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.000
 you definitely have the chance 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.680
 somehow getting bigger then comes 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.540
 Of course, that also depends on what 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.760
 you somehow connect and have like 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.620
 for example, to larger small or something 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.720
 and because somehow one could try too 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.549
 get or something in bavaria 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.660
 what would I have no fun so what are you doing 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.970
 in any case it should to also 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.400
 not her heart from the bus in the comments 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.200
 write 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.130
 subscribe me I also do cod 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.959
 comments I'm also cool subscribed 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.820
 me no you can not do that either 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.640
 do not take that 0 I hate her 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.200
 always earlier, why do you all 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.060
 comment that I have seen so 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
 somehow pressed direct display 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.550
 but somehow, that's not enough anymore 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.190
 because he comments to be too much work 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.260
 to look at these are the biggest crap 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.760
 something does not make so do not use 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.950
 such regulation to grow up no no 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.610
 completely wrong wrong way completely 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.680
 to forget 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.060
 In any case, you were here again for 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.570
 this comment i hope you have that 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.640
 like 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.440
 skin purely let a rating of the 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.850
 puck at the last video over cook at 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.580
