00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.849
 just finished the meeting that's why some closing 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.140
 from the university radio 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.630
 In this context, a discussion that comes from before 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.400
 that has to do precisely with the discussion that started this issue of the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.410
 radio that is the expulsion by the education budget by the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.589
 budget 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.530
 that is being discussed for the management of the university mind 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.320
 national of rosario that what was happening last week 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 how to stop a context prior to what happened in this day 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.710
 soda and with tomorrow in santiago with dyson 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 if you do not tell me January nielsen has signaled sario 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.880
 what was happening last week was the following on Tuesday of the week 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.790
 past asp took place the finance commission that the council works 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.840
 of the university where the 2009 budget of the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 university and on Thursday it had been convened 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160
 to assassinate that base to the faculty of agricultural sciences 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.230
 the superior council that supposedly had called in its agenda the 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.340
 approval of this budget project that is management 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.210
 by center center of left students plus other organizations and 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.490
 we note fighting for the expansion of the budget and for the rediscussion of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.450
 how that budget is distributed is inside the university 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.070
 we mobilized on Tuesday 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 to the ceoe this commission of finance was not going to take place 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.910
 they also add particular cases of faculties such as the case of psychology 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.250
 of nursing right art that have problems edilicios urgently already very well 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.020
 planted too 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.670
 this one in osaka and we find that 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.590
 the session of the commission had passed for the rectorship seat which is in 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.640
 another building 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 the superior adviser of left 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.040
 well have participated in the discussion that commission was in that commission where 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.620
 the saying of the dean of agrarian 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.540
 that for us it was just having thought out loud this 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.650
 yes we lack money for so many fundamental things to sustain nor do I love the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.139
 I work the faculties 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.889
 in question we have not this radio university 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.309
 actually for us this was like you have to think out loud nobody ever 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.739
 he went out to question 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.540
 or anything like the radio operating university we are all one 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.549
 group says they are and therefore the power to propose Americans to the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.019
 faculty of political science where the communication career works 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.239
 we have compañeras and compañeros who work in radio universidad we have 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.159
 presented project as your passion that will bring on rabbin and clay here 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.040
 fundamentally, what we are discussing is the issue of contracts for 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.489
 the extension policy internships of who is entitled to table 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.019
 the communication career towards university radio 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.389
 and for us this time it's a political operation 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.040
 to divert the real discussion is that we want to spend the budget 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.609
 we would never go 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.399
 the church has so much budget let's take it out 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.749
 for other things that are more precarious in any case we would sell three times 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.529
 by budgeting diversity so that that radio works better in terms of 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.529
 comprehensive training of professionals in terms of pre-professional practice 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.629
 And experience 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:08.790
 this 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.770
 In any case, we have what is challenged with the 30 million that 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.300
 part of that budget to the operation of the seat of government and 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.539
 the rector 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.939
 per cent to the discretion with the conanp that money is handled from 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.439
 of g the management 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.489
 we also question not because in 2007, product of the whole process of 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.329
 struggle facing the feración the city of rosario with was led by the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:30.979
 left 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.249
 was obtained from the superior council will approve projects that said that the 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.279
 silver that the faculties handle discretionally 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.539
 were controlled by the boards this is the senate itself 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:42.859
 produced that is the money that are produced from the child 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.599
 populated post-titles 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.659
 this photocopiers bars 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.829
 I know that bases less or what we think is that the rector 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:51.930
 what you want 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.470
 run the axis the discussion 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.000
 the budget even though the 2009 budget is a shame are three sheets in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.860
 the one that does not 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.950
 justifies in the concept of what money is intended, what is intended, for example, 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.440
 increased the budget allocated to private security thing that we 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.219
 we're 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.079
 deeply disagree 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.999
 with the presence the road safety public university is paid the 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.379
 federal police when the university is no longer self and the police has 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.010
 Forbidden to enter the university does not apply to be that money 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.270
 As a scholarship a closed number of one million pesos is given. 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.620
 justifies what is redistribution inward 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.960
 and what requirements do they have to meet to make stops to access those 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.569
 scholarships 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.580
 that is to say 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.500
 love the pair of a police operation that is put in certain groups 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.669
 good politicians say say ally of a dean 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.199
 questions freedom of the press question freedom of expression by 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.509
 now neither sanctions nor even autonomous like ours that d 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.069
 alternative media and music and how to bancard the funds 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.020
 for that he called when we, but for us, let's say the politics of 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.490
 mello and diffusion 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.150
 and alternative press is so important 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.430
 baby we live 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.400
 put in vogue our that we want him to get out 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.430
 budget the university to larraín ibércia the recession is a shame 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.210
 that what is being discussed is the 2009 budget the university 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.960
 is being discussed in an inflation context in a context in which 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.470
 is lowering the income to universities in a context in which 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.470
 this management gives clear signs that it has no political will 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.050
 to get to discuss how do you finally expelled the public university 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.640
 and that is more students who can finish their career
