thought that the injury was worse than

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.350 
thought that the injury was worse than

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it really was and she was back in about

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.850 
it really was and she was back in about
six<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.840> eight<00:02:06.869> weeks<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> ring

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
six to eight weeks on in the ring

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.320 
six to eight weeks on in the ring
again<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.220> she<00:02:09.310> could<00:02:09.550> keep<00:02:09.759> her<00:02:09.820> title

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
again and she could keep her title

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.530 
again and she could keep her title
without<00:02:10.450> having<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.050> forfeiting<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.710> I<00:02:12.540> really

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
without having to forfeiting it I really

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.650 
without having to forfeiting it I really
hope<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.620> case<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:16.210> time<00:02:16.270> as

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
hope that it's the case this time as

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
hope that it's the case this time as
well<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:18.640> speaks<00:02:18.970> against<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:20.020> that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
well and what speaks against it is that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.320 
well and what speaks against it is that
it<00:02:21.370> might<00:02:21.730> have<00:02:21.970> been<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.570> Maurice<00:02:23.440> tried<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
it might have been that Maurice tried to
