with<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> older<00:02:11.930> course<00:02:12.230> those<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.739> arms<00:02:13.010> and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
with the older course those and arms and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.729 
with the older course those and arms and
things<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> female<00:02:15.080> right<00:02:15.440> here's

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
things that's the female right here's

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.280 
things that's the female right here's
the<00:02:15.800> male<00:02:16.129> minifigure<00:02:16.970> which<00:02:17.720> essentially

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the male minifigure which essentially

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.080 
the male minifigure which essentially
these<00:02:18.440> minifigures<00:02:19.040> are<00:02:19.250> identical<00:02:19.730> except

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
these minifigures are identical except

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.690 
these minifigures are identical except
for<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.330> hairpiece<00:02:20.660> one<00:02:21.500> has<00:02:21.739> female<00:02:22.430> here

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
for the hairpiece one has female here

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.940 
for the hairpiece one has female here
the<00:02:22.940> other<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:23.239> has<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> cap<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
the other one just has a cap so the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.949 
the other one just has a cap so the
early<00:02:25.430> minifigures<00:02:26.000> only<00:02:26.269> had<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.569> standard

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
early minifigures only had the standard

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.430 
early minifigures only had the standard
smile<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.800> eye<00:02:28.580> pattern<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.200> only<00:02:30.349> way

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
smile and eye pattern so the only way

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.350 
smile and eye pattern so the only way
you<00:02:30.500> could<00:02:30.709> distinguish<00:02:31.220> male<00:02:31.670> or<00:02:31.819> female<00:02:32.180> is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
you could distinguish male or female is

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.150 
you could distinguish male or female is
either<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.720> hairpiece<00:02:33.170> or<00:02:33.530> sometimes<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
either the hairpiece or sometimes the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.900 
either the hairpiece or sometimes the
poor<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:36.560> paramedics<00:02:36.950> with<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:37.760> our

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
poor so to paramedics with this so our

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.000 
poor so to paramedics with this so our
patient<00:02:38.840> has<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:38.989> better<00:02:39.080> chance<00:02:39.290> because<00:02:39.799> two

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
patient has a better chance because two

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.920 
patient has a better chance because two
people<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.519> pick<00:02:40.670> them<00:02:40.879> up<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.209> with<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
people can pick them up in with the the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.270 
people can pick them up in with the the
stretcher<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.140> lot<00:02:45.319> easier<00:02:45.650> than<00:02:45.799> one<00:02:46.040> good

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
stretcher a lot easier than one good

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.400 
stretcher a lot easier than one good
right<00:02:46.790> yeah<00:02:47.299> here's<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.780> ambulance<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.349> you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
right yeah here's the ambulance and you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.569 
right yeah here's the ambulance and you
can<00:02:48.680> actually<00:02:48.829> put<00:02:49.220> your<00:02:49.660> driver<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:50.989> there<00:02:51.579> it

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
can actually put your driver in there it

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.539 
can actually put your driver in there it

has the roof here does open up falls
apart<00:02:55.849> real<00:02:56.030> easy<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.720> doesn't<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
apart real easy it doesn't have a

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
this what the back looks like it's got

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.970 
this what the back looks like it's got
the<00:03:19.850> treaded<00:03:20.540> wheels<00:03:20.780> instead<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.709> smooth

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
the treaded wheels instead of the smooth

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.050 
the treaded wheels instead of the smooth
wheels<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.560> late<00:03:24.560> 70s<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.670> started

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
wheels so in the late 70s you started

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.059 
wheels so in the late 70s you started
getting<00:03:26.120> these<00:03:26.359> treaded<00:03:26.959> wheels<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.769> early

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
getting these treaded wheels the early

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.680 
getting these treaded wheels the early
mini<00:03:28.579> wheels<00:03:28.819> were<00:03:29.090> all<00:03:29.239> smooth<00:03:31.480> now<00:03:32.480> we'll

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
mini wheels were all smooth now we'll

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.870 
mini wheels were all smooth now we'll
look<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.079> instruction<00:03:33.590> manual<00:03:34.040> shows<00:03:34.730> you

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
look at the instruction manual shows you

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.509 
look at the instruction manual shows you
how<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.030> load<00:03:35.269> your<00:03:36.190> stretcher<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.310> there

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
how to load your stretcher in there

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.670 
how to load your stretcher in there
shows<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.030> how<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.750> rebuild<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.380> into

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
shows you how you can rebuild it into

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.550 
shows you how you can rebuild it into
other<00:03:40.000> designs<00:03:42.010> odd-looking<00:03:43.010> airplane

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560

and<00:03:47.810> does<00:03:48.049> show<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.680> date<00:03:48.889> here<00:03:49.220> which<00:03:49.700> is

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
and does show you the date here which is

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.120 
and does show you the date here which is
1980<00:03:52.450> 1981<00:03:53.450> first<00:03:54.260> year<00:03:54.500> this<00:03:54.680> set<00:03:54.920> was

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
1980 1981 first year this set was

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.690 
1980 1981 first year this set was
produced<00:03:55.540> usually<00:03:56.540> they<00:03:57.380> ran<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:58.099> two<00:03:58.549> or

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
produced usually they ran in two or

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.039 
produced usually they ran in two or
three<00:03:58.910> year<00:03:59.090> cycles<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.049> sits<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:02.780> this

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
three year cycles with the sits so this

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.259 
three year cycles with the sits so this
one's<00:04:03.310> 32<00:04:04.310> years<00:04:04.549> old<00:04:04.760> essentially<00:04:07.209> it's<00:04:08.209> the

one's 32 years old essentially it's the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.210 
one's 32 years old essentially it's the
ambulance<00:04:08.810> now<00:04:08.900> let's<00:04:09.260> compare<00:04:09.889> it<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.069> a

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
some equipment to work with the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
some equipment to work with the
briefcase<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:43.670> IV<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:45.020> he<00:04:45.170> can't<00:04:45.410> load<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
briefcase and IV but he can't load the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.940 
briefcase and IV but he can't load the
victim<00:04:47.210> into<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.630> stretcher<00:04:48.080> because<00:04:48.680> he's

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
victim into the stretcher because he's

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.460 
victim into the stretcher because he's
only<00:04:49.100> by<00:04:49.340> themselves<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:50.450> one<00:04:50.690> bit<00:04:50.930> gets<00:04:51.260> two

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
only by themselves this one bit gets two

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.870 
only by themselves this one bit gets two
minifigures<00:04:51.920> but<00:04:52.310> they<00:04:52.400> don't<00:04:52.550> have<00:04:52.700> any

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
minifigures but they don't have any

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.430 
minifigures but they don't have any
equipment<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.450> work<00:04:53.570> on<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.930> patient

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
equipment to work on the patient

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.750 
equipment to work on the patient
so<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:56.360> guess<00:04:56.900> either<00:04:57.080> way<00:04:57.260> patient<00:04:57.890> settle<00:04:58.250> up

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
so I guess either way patient settle up

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.560 
so I guess either way patient settle up
so<00:04:59.660> these<00:04:59.780> are<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.050> two<00:05:00.230> sets<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.570> 1981

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
so these are the two sets the 1981

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.860 
so these are the two sets the 1981
version<00:05:02.990> go<00:05:03.530> forward<00:05:04.070> in<00:05:04.220> time<00:05:04.250> 25<00:05:04.910> years<00:05:04.970> the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
version go forward in time 25 years the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.700 
version go forward in time 25 years the
2006<00:05:06.770> version<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.120> ambulance<00:05:08.620> tell<00:05:09.620> me
