through<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.640> back<00:01:28.759> loop<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.420> can

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
through the back loop so you can

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.960 
through the back loop so you can
actually<00:01:29.899> just<00:01:30.049> leave<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.920> needle<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.410 
loop if you'd like so now we're going to
knit<00:01:35.020> through<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.049> back<00:01:36.170> loop<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.700> we're

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
knit through the back loop and we're

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.660 
knit through the back loop and we're
going<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.600> place<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.229> stitch<00:01:39.500> back<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
loop again and then we're going to do

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.960 
loop again and then we're going to do
that<00:01:45.560> one<00:01:45.860> more<00:01:46.159> time<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:48.819> essentially<00:01:49.819> what

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
that one more time so essentially what

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.820 
that one more time so essentially what
we're<00:01:50.090> doing<00:01:50.119> is<00:01:50.420> almost<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.990> crochet<00:01:51.560> chain

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
we're doing is almost a crochet chain

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.969 
we're doing is almost a crochet chain
and<00:01:52.539> it's<00:01:53.539> going<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.810> create<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.289> elongated

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
and it's going to create this elongated

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.059 
and it's going to create this elongated
stitch<00:01:55.490> as<00:01:55.819> you<00:01:55.940> can<00:01:56.090> see<00:01:56.330> here<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:57.530> when<00:01:57.920> we

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
stitch as you can see here now when we

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.190 
stitch as you can see here now when we
bring<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.880> back<00:01:58.939> in<00:01:59.450> line<00:01:59.750> with<00:02:00.740> our<00:02:01.179> regular

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
bring that back in line with our regular

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.630 
bring that back in line with our regular
knitting<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.649> going<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.890> create<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.189> little

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
knitting it's going to create a little

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.820 
knitting it's going to create a little
mini<00:02:04.879> bobble<00:02:05.420> that's<00:02:05.959> going<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.140> pop<00:02:06.349> out<00:02:06.590> and
