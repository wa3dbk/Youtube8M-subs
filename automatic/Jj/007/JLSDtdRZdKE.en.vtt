00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
today so we're going to extract this led

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
today so we're going to extract this led
battery<00:00:43.050> go<00:00:43.500> ahead<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.770> show<00:00:43.890> us<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
battery go ahead and show us to take it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.630 
battery go ahead and show us to take it
out<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.680> show<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> folks<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.460> home

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
well how heavy is that say about I don't

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.400 
well how heavy is that say about I don't
know<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:33.910> about<00:01:34.300> it's<00:01:34.900> about<00:01:35.050> 10

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
know like it's about it's about 10

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.110 
know like it's about it's about 10
pounds<00:01:35.680> it's<00:01:36.070> about<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:36.460> bouncy<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.000> I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
pounds it's about that bouncy and I

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.220 
pounds it's about that bouncy and I
would<00:01:37.270> say<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:38.650> least<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.900> size

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
would say at least there's the size

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.120 
would say at least there's the size
difference<00:01:43.110> quite<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> bit<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:45.280> right<00:01:47.130> throw

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130

a prototype but they're all worth they
one<00:02:04.869> two<00:02:05.080> three<00:02:05.350> cells<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.670> all<00:02:06.820> worked<00:02:07.060> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
one two three cells so it all worked the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.630 
one two three cells so it all worked the
same<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.360> our<00:02:10.509> insulator<00:02:11.020> around<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
same this is our insulator around the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.910 
same this is our insulator around the
positive<00:02:12.640> terminal<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:20.500> ahead<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.770> hook

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
positive terminal so go ahead and hook

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.340 
positive terminal so go ahead and hook
those<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.489> that's<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.090> negative<00:02:22.560> yep

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.110

yeah there we go cuz it holds a little

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.960 
yeah there we go cuz it holds a little
bigger<00:03:09.490> in<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.790> terminal<00:03:14.790> get<00:03:15.790> your

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
bigger in the terminal get your

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.940 
bigger in the terminal get your
screwdriver<00:03:16.270> okay<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.440> need<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> put<00:03:20.830> this

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
screwdriver okay do you need to put this

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.860 
screwdriver okay do you need to put this
this<00:03:21.550> this<00:03:21.760> goes<00:03:22.000> on<00:03:22.150> no<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.330> just<00:03:22.510> do<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
point yeah we're just hooking it up

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.800 
point yeah we're just hooking it up
right<00:03:27.280> now<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.550> testing

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:48.530 

all<00:03:38.380> right

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
they don't have in your room here and we

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.850 
they don't have in your room here and we
have<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.130> bring<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.340> up<00:03:51.630> over<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.750> top<00:03:53.020> can
