Phoenix Suns wants out he wants to get
traded<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:05.940> he's<00:00:06.089> been<00:00:06.270> very<00:00:06.870> upfront<00:00:07.470> about

traded and he's been very upfront about

traded and he's been very upfront about
that<00:00:09.110> now<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.500> far<00:00:10.679> as<00:00:10.740> where<00:00:11.010> his<00:00:11.190> reasoning

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
that now as far as where his reasoning

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.100 
that now as far as where his reasoning
for<00:00:11.610> wanting<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.300> moved<00:00:12.540> I'll<00:00:12.719> admit<00:00:12.990> it's

for wanting to be moved I'll admit it's

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.509 
for wanting to be moved I'll admit it's
a<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:13.259> odd<00:00:13.590> because<00:00:14.009> they<00:00:14.130> traded<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
a little odd because they traded a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.900 
a little odd because they traded a
brother<00:00:14.849> like<00:00:15.740> NBA's<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> businessman<00:00:17.400> come<00:00:17.699> on

like you just gotta you gotta accept

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.290 
like you just gotta you gotta accept
that<00:00:21.539> type<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> stuff<00:00:22.310> but<00:00:23.310> doesn't<00:00:24.150> change

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
that type of stuff but doesn't change

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
that type of stuff but doesn't change
the<00:00:24.480> fact<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.810> he<00:00:24.960> does<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the fact that he does one out so the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.390 
the fact that he does one out so the
question<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:27.260> how<00:00:28.260> valuable<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.980> Markieff

put the ball on the floor finish in the
post<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.399> decent<00:00:48.270> touch<00:00:48.690> around<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> rim

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
post a bit decent touch around the rim

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
post a bit decent touch around the rim
and<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.210> under<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.989> coach<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and I think under the right coach in the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
and I think under the right coach in the
right<00:00:53.070> system<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.719> Markieff<00:00:55.079> Morris

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
right system I think Markieff Morris

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
right system I think Markieff Morris
could<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> solid<00:00:56.280> eighteen<00:00:56.789> point<00:00:57.449> scorer

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
could be a solid eighteen point scorer

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
could be a solid eighteen point scorer
on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.109> team<00:00:58.199> being<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:58.949> versatile<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.789> of

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
on the team being very versatile kind of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
on the team being very versatile kind of
do<00:01:00.000> whatever<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:01.109> free-throw<00:01:01.410> shooter<00:01:01.649> as

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
do whatever good free-throw shooter as

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.000 
do whatever good free-throw shooter as
well<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.470> hopefully<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.619> keep<00:01:04.830> progressing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
well as hopefully you keep progressing

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450 
well as hopefully you keep progressing
on<00:01:05.400> three-point<00:01:05.939> shot<00:01:06.920> would<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.310> them

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
on three-point shot would you take them

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.570 
on three-point shot would you take them
because<00:01:09.000> being<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.479> Celtics<00:01:09.930> fan<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.979> love

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because being a Celtics fan I would love

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
because being a Celtics fan I would love
to<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.970> Markieff<00:01:12.450> Morris<00:01:12.680> especially<00:01:13.680> over

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to have Markieff Morris especially over

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
to have Markieff Morris especially over
Jared<00:01:14.310> Sullinger<00:01:14.630> okay<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:15.990> David<00:01:16.320> Lee

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
Jared Sullinger okay we have David Lee

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
Jared Sullinger okay we have David Lee
now<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.700> Markieff<00:01:18.210> Morris<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.659> ceiling

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
now I think Markieff Morris is ceiling

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719 
now I think Markieff Morris is ceiling
is<00:01:19.259> probably<00:01:19.650> higher<00:01:19.830> than<00:01:19.860> David<00:01:20.369> Lee<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.700> be

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
is probably higher than David Lee to be

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
is probably higher than David Lee to be
honest<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.280> character

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
honest but there are some character

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.149 
honest but there are some character
issues<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.390> guy<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.900> course<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.890> fact

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
issues with this guy of course the fact

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.710 
issues with this guy of course the fact
that<00:01:26.400> we're<00:01:26.520> even<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> situation<00:01:27.659> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that we're even in this situation is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
that we're even in this situation is
kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.020> weird<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.920> also<00:01:29.250> there's<00:01:29.460> some

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
kind of weird but also there's some

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
kind of weird but also there's some
legal<00:01:29.850> trouble<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.450> him<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:30.869> brother

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
legal trouble with him and his brother

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
legal trouble with him and his brother
apparently<00:01:31.500> beating<00:01:32.130> somebody<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
apparently beating somebody up that's a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.760 
apparently beating somebody up that's a
real<00:01:33.810> thing

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
real thing

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830 
real thing
so<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.760> if<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.150> take<00:01:36.360> him<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> you're

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so I think if you take him in you're

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.890 
so I think if you take him in you're
gonna<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> strong<00:01:37.710> culture<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.610> would<00:01:39.450> like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
gonna need a strong culture I would like

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.750 
gonna need a strong culture I would like
to<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.200> Markieff<00:01:40.650> Morris<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> made<00:01:41.430> sense

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
to have Markieff Morris if it made sense

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.180 
to have Markieff Morris if it made sense
if<00:01:41.940> I<00:01:42.000> had<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.450> team<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> just

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
if I had the right team if I if you just

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.460 
if I had the right team if I if you just
fit<00:01:44.550> into<00:01:44.760> that<00:01:44.970> power<00:01:45.270> forward<00:01:45.780> slot<00:01:46.140> well

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
fit into that power forward slot well

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.340 
fit into that power forward slot well
enough<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.509> would<00:01:48.509> take<00:01:48.720> him<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.290> think

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
enough I would take him because I think

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.640 
enough I would take him because I think
he's<00:01:49.680> extremely<00:01:50.100> versatile<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.000> also<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.380> he

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
he's extremely versatile I also think he

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.680 
he's extremely versatile I also think he
has<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.920> hit<00:01:53.100> his<00:01:53.280> ceiling<00:01:53.460> yet<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.479> think

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
has not hit his ceiling yet and I think

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.060 
has not hit his ceiling yet and I think
he's<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.050> overall<00:01:55.409> being<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> that's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
he's got an overall being and that's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.660 
he's got an overall being and that's
just<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.670> strong<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.750> course<00:01:58.670> maybe

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
just really strong but of course maybe

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.920 
just really strong but of course maybe
you<00:01:59.820> guys<00:01:59.940> disagree<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.479> me<00:02:00.630> that's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
