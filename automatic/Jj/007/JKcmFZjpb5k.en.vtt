00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
box as well

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.740 
box as well
which<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> rock<00:02:26.310> side<00:02:26.880> sort<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.450> theme

which is like a rock side sort of theme
to<00:02:27.780> give<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.320> extra<00:02:28.670> cold<00:02:29.670> look<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
to give it that extra cold look the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.250 
to give it that extra cold look the
controls<00:02:31.500> are<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.970> based<00:02:33.269> on<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> GameCube

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.550 
controller
virtually<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.910> same<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> same<00:02:36.930> positions

the<00:02:37.920> only<00:02:38.100> difference<00:02:38.489> being<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.970> this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the only difference being on this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.000 
the only difference being on this
controller<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.050> don't<00:02:40.320> hold<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.860> a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
controller is you don't hold it like a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.070

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
so that you could see every side and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.599 
so that you could see every side and
angle<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.079> packaging<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.950> what<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.370> looks

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
angle of the packaging and what it looks

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.580 
angle of the packaging and what it looks
like<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.120> as<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.660> can<00:04:09.780> see<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.139> chainsaw

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.500 
like and as you can see the chainsaw
blade<00:04:10.859> hangs<00:04:11.280> outside<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.850> packaging<00:04:12.359> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
blade hangs outside the packaging I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.840 
blade hangs outside the packaging I
actually<00:04:12.720> prefer<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.260> ps2<00:04:13.920> blade<00:04:14.190> as<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.639> has

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
actually prefer the ps2 blade as it has

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.420 
actually prefer the ps2 blade as it has
this<00:04:15.060> mirror<00:04:15.450> type<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:16.049> coating<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.739> makes

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
this mirror type of coating and makes

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.969 
this mirror type of coating and makes
the<00:04:17.639> individual<00:04:18.600> blood<00:04:18.810> splattering<00:04:19.410> look

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
the individual blood splattering look

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.560 
the individual blood splattering look
even<00:04:20.489> more<00:04:20.700> effective
