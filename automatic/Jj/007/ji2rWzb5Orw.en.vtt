00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.029
 well it it everybody knows I 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 comment are you going to me it's going great 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.800
 we simply find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.860
 little big air pays so a limited rpi 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.599
 so on gta 5 rafter patch 1.09 so 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.400
 it's very simple it's an erp is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 really very simple so you will need 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.089
 simply try to find a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.400
 car that apart for example had 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:36.809
 always reported in glass on the map or 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.339
 just take a car 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.650
 you know the mark because there is 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.079
 often brands that you know 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.420
 so simons this simons car 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.340
 in fact we must take so simons and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140
 who is this the dealer 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 so in the story mode 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.379
 so it's up to him that you have to go 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.750
 resell your vehicles is basically the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.840
 tarpaulin not too much weight to the port will 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.850
 resell them 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.530
 basically for example so just 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.450
 a car like that your friend who you 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 will also need it will also need the same 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.140
 car exactly the same then 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.610
 why the same cars and why 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.450
 the simone car then very young 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.890
 simone it looks like the simon will say if 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.330
 I tried to make it heard in 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.190
 english but i'm not at all english 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.740
 I'm just if I 'm honest 10th 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.729
 richard we are here so why 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.869
 art the same cars and not 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.340
 simply in fact when you go 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.920
 take the cement car as it is 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.660
 a stolen car six months they want to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.940
 any price you rhdp neither direct 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.190
 to be able to mingle cops to be able to 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.520
 see it we'll say normal car 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.020
 really not stole 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.549
 so that's actually it's okay 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.600
 give two stars each time would say 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.219
 when you go up the car that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 tells you a two-star and like you 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.049
 are before the los santos was losc 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.329
 me as soon as you go inside 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.619
 did admit 200 rp so every time 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.259
 there is really a way to be done 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.079
 quickly your xp bar - the bar 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.610
 10 p 69 to 70 this game the really made in 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.689
 10 15 minutes frankly without you 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.579
 lie in 10 15 minutes 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.899
 I filled it so it's really something 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.340
 which really pays off is really 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.929
 fast was not shit either 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.130
 enormously it's really something that 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.329
 it's just a big trick but 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.319
 it's still a glitch because 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.429
 it's still a little buzz like that 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.209
 because we come back every time 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.979
 cars etc 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.940
 So here you have been healthy enough 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.700
 can take any car 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.110
 simon it will work so you need to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.430
 all prices there are two stars once 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 you have the stars you come in 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.519
 get your buddy back in there too 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.049
 spring and you change cars to 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.160
 every time you return to receive you 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.630
 washing hands all inclusive green 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.890
 between you have the video in front of you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.299
