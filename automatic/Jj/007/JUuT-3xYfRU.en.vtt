recording for heavy rods through this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.100 
recording for heavy rods through this
trunk<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
trunk and as we can see here this is the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.950 
trunk and as we can see here this is the
section<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:01.860> concerned<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
section that I'm concerned about and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.200 
section that I'm concerned about and
that<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.140> some<00:01:04.170> stage<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> may<00:01:05.970> fail<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
that at some stage this may fail and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.820 
that at some stage this may fail and
this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> quite<00:01:09.600> an<00:01:09.720> old<00:01:09.900> tree<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> should

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
this is quite an old tree and should

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.710 
this is quite an old tree and should
have<00:01:10.920> fused<00:01:11.460> together<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
have fused together if it was going to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
have fused together if it was going to
buy<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.009> know<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.399> lot<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
buy now so we know there's a lot of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.450 
buy now so we know there's a lot of
movements<00:01:15.119> between<00:01:15.240> these<00:01:15.690> two<00:01:16.100> sections<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
movements between these two sections of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.149 
movements between these two sections of
the<00:01:17.550> tree<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:19.170> therefore<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the tree and therefore we're going to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.029 
the tree and therefore we're going to
insert<00:01:20.940> for<00:01:21.300> large<00:01:21.540> rods<00:01:24.830> through<00:01:25.830> this

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
insert for large rods through this

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.919 
insert for large rods through this
you're<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.440> two<00:01:28.440> here<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> two

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
you're going to put two here and two

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.090 
you're going to put two here and two
down<00:01:30.929> lower<00:01:31.289> plus<00:01:32.210> two<00:01:33.210> other<00:01:33.450> rods<00:01:33.720> just

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
down lower plus two other rods just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.910 
down lower plus two other rods just
above<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.160> crotch<00:01:36.289> coming<00:01:37.289> coming<00:01:37.560> through

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
above the crotch coming coming through

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.330 
above the crotch coming coming through
this<00:01:38.100> area<00:01:38.429> here<00:01:39.440> this<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> drill<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.220> be

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this area here this is the drill will be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.669 
this area here this is the drill will be
using<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:44.390> as<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:45.960> further<00:01:46.200> into<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
using and as we get further into the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.370 
using and as we get further into the
tree<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:48.000> drill<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.450> goes<00:01:48.690> into<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
tree this drill then goes into the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.139 
tree this drill then goes into the
extension<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.190> when<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.610> need<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
extension and when we need to that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.219 
extension and when we need to that
extension<00:01:54.509> goes<00:01:54.869> into<00:01:55.229> another<00:01:55.350> extension

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
extension goes into another extension

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.260 
extension goes into another extension
this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> rods<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.759> using

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
this is one of the rods will be using

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.690 
this is one of the rods will be using
and<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.590> one<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> longer<00:02:03.189> ones<00:02:03.399> which

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
and this is one of the longer ones which

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.339 
and this is one of the longer ones which
will<00:02:03.850> be<00:02:03.969> going<00:02:04.289> above<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.530> crotch<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:07.509> we

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
will be going above the crotch then we

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.949 
will be going above the crotch then we
have<00:02:08.590> some<00:02:08.920> shorter<00:02:09.879> hike<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.629> so<00:02:10.899> I'll

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
have some shorter hike in so I'll

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.720 
have some shorter hike in so I'll
threaded<00:02:11.890> bar<00:02:13.500> mucci<00:02:14.500> here<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.400> these<00:02:15.519> are

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
threaded bar mucci here and these are

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.589 
threaded bar mucci here and these are
the<00:02:15.790> four<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.720> can't<00:02:17.680> I'll<00:02:17.890> threaded<00:02:18.220> bars<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
the four I can't I'll threaded bars the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.350 
the four I can't I'll threaded bars the
22<00:02:20.170> ml<00:02:20.410> thick<00:02:20.620> which<00:02:21.010> will<00:02:21.190> be<00:02:21.310> inserted<00:02:21.640> into

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
22 ml thick which will be inserted into

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.949 
22 ml thick which will be inserted into
the<00:02:22.569> trick<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.230> will<00:02:23.830> make<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:25.060> start<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.690> we'll

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
the trick I will make a start and we'll

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:52.210 
the trick I will make a start and we'll
report<00:02:27.060> again<00:02:28.060> as<00:02:28.239> we<00:02:28.450> get<00:02:29.349> into<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.739> job

at a time these drill bits just want to
keep<00:02:57.020> going<00:02:57.500> they<00:02:57.650> bought<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.070> really<00:02:58.400> well

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
keep going they bought in really well

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.320 
keep going they bought in really well
and<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:59.090> they<00:02:59.540> very<00:02:59.780> easy<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.760> get<00:03:01.760> jammed<00:03:02.090> in

a<00:03:27.709> little<00:03:28.280> bit<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.489> time

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.970 

hey<00:03:32.280> uh<00:03:32.310> trigonal

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.430 

I<00:03:40.819> could<00:03:41.269> have<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.450> look<00:03:41.629> at<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> rods<00:03:42.200> we've

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
I could have a look at the rods we've

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.039 
I could have a look at the rods we've
inserted<00:03:42.769> into<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.250> tree<00:03:43.580> or<00:03:43.970> we<00:03:44.150> we<00:03:44.690> go<00:03:44.840> any

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
inserted into the tree or we we go any

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.940 
inserted into the tree or we we go any
further<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:45.620> will<00:03:45.799> be<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.430> mark<00:03:47.090> around<00:03:47.950> which

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
further now will be a mark around which

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.850 
further now will be a mark around which
the<00:03:48.980> washer's<00:03:49.610> here<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.390> see<00:03:50.629> but<00:03:50.860> the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
the washer's here you can see but the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.440 
the washer's here you can see but the
texture<00:03:52.310> mark<00:03:52.519> there<00:03:52.730> will<00:03:52.909> be<00:03:53.030> chiseling

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
texture mark there will be chiseling

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.899 
texture mark there will be chiseling
this<00:03:54.290> bit<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.560> bark<00:03:54.769> out<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.310> wash<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.700> sits

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
this bit of bark out so to wash it sits

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.000 
this bit of bark out so to wash it sits
in<00:03:56.090> their<00:03:56.269> nice<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.750> neat

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.490 

and<00:04:00.580> then<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:00.849> just<00:04:00.879> got<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.239> cut<00:04:01.390> off<00:04:01.510> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
and then we just got to cut off the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.869 
and then we just got to cut off the
excess

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.119 

okay<00:04:12.879> will<00:04:13.330> sup<00:04:13.629> with<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:14.290> now<00:04:14.470> completed

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
okay will sup with just now completed

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.140 
okay will sup with just now completed
God<00:04:16.120> bracing<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:16.930> elm<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:19.000> will<00:04:19.120> just

God bracing this elm and I will just

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.460 
God bracing this elm and I will just
have<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.480> look<00:04:19.600> at<00:04:19.750> everything<00:04:19.930> we've<00:04:20.290> done

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
have a look at everything we've done

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.740 
have a look at everything we've done
here<00:04:20.739> we've<00:04:21.549> got<00:04:21.579> full<00:04:21.970> heart<00:04:22.240> n<00:04:22.510> soul<00:04:22.540> bolts

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
here we've got full heart n soul bolts

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.680 
here we've got full heart n soul bolts
going<00:04:25.750> through<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.139> main<00:04:26.320> trunk<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:28.540> there's

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
going through the main trunk and there's

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:38.230 
going through the main trunk and there's
back<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.900> bit<00:04:29.850> evenly<00:04:30.850> spaced

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240 

that's<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.020> problem<00:04:39.259> there<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.770> what<00:04:40.099> we

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
that's the problem there that what we

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.860 
that's the problem there that what we
thought<00:04:40.430> could<00:04:41.000> be<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> problem<00:04:41.360> in<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.660> future

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
thought could be a problem in the future

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.200 
thought could be a problem in the future
of<00:04:42.110> this<00:04:42.199> tree<00:04:42.500> because<00:04:43.490> this<00:04:43.639> this<00:04:43.910> way<00:04:44.150> to

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
of this tree because this this way to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.890 
of this tree because this this way to
hear<00:04:44.569> a<00:04:44.840> lot<00:04:45.319> of<00:04:45.380> way<00:04:45.620> about<00:04:46.460> their<00:04:46.910> get<00:04:47.780> how<00:04:47.870> to

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
hear a lot of way about their get how to

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.080 
hear a lot of way about their get how to
pick<00:04:48.169> up<00:04:48.319> from<00:04:49.099> this<00:04:49.220> angle<00:04:49.460> but<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.849> water

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
pick up from this angle but the water

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.089 
pick up from this angle but the water
wait<00:04:50.330> there<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.910> if<00:04:53.710> we're<00:04:54.710> holding<00:04:55.009> that

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
wait there so if we're holding that

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.379 
wait there so if we're holding that
together<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:56.240> it's<00:04:56.389> got<00:04:56.770> at<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.039> side<00:04:58.389> and

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
together and it's got at this side and

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.610 
together and it's got at this side and
just<00:05:00.229> above<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.560> crotch<00:05:00.919> there's<00:05:01.729> our<00:05:02.620> two

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
just above the crotch there's our two

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.180 
just above the crotch there's our two
rides

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:25.330 

that's<00:05:10.940> when<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.240> came<00:05:11.300> up<00:05:11.540> here

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.100 

and<00:05:25.880> that's<00:05:26.060> where<00:05:26.240> they<00:05:26.330> come<00:05:26.570> out<00:05:26.750> not

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
and that's where they come out not

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.540 
and that's where they come out not
exactly<00:05:27.320> along<00:05:27.680> with<00:05:27.860> each<00:05:27.980> other<00:05:28.190> but<00:05:28.370> that's

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
exactly along with each other but that's

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.170 
exactly along with each other but that's
what<00:05:28.760> we<00:05:28.880> intended<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:30.290> have<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.100> bolts<00:05:31.880> and

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
what we intended to have the bolts and

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.800 
what we intended to have the bolts and
offset<00:05:35.350> now<00:05:36.350> that<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.680> jobs<00:05:36.949> completed<00:05:37.810> been

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
offset now that this jobs completed been

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.320 
offset now that this jobs completed been
about<00:05:39.020> a<00:05:39.080> year<00:05:39.169> now<00:05:39.410> since<00:05:40.340> we've<00:05:40.669> inspected

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
about a year now since we've inspected

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.730 
about a year now since we've inspected
cables<00:05:42.310> above<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.580> so<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.300> our<00:05:44.449> work<00:05:44.690> is<00:05:45.530> just

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
cables above and so in our work is just

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.580 
cables above and so in our work is just
going<00:05:45.949> up

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
going up

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.070 
going up
to<00:05:48.160> inspect<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.760> cable<00:05:49.480> bracing<00:05:49.870> system

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
above this tree is going to be quite

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.730 
above this tree is going to be quite
tightly<00:05:56.650> sometime
