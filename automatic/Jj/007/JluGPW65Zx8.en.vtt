00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.940
 more sold first so these are the most 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.910
 sold so we have wayne rooney so 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.790
 Here look good I sold 87 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.360

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 credit for an average profit of 44 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.550
 4275 credit which is a little more than 10% 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.170
 the purchase price 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.220
 so you see that's what I'm telling you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.810
 always I will try to do this 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 day 10% of the purchase price of profits 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.670
 as I tell you all the time 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.920
 usually 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 so here I have sold 87 for a 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.330
 total profit of 371 1930 credit so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.380
 this is more rooney is a player 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.240
 accessible for a lot of people 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.540
 it's not like ronaldo or something 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.620
 like that 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 really it's really players 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.580
 accessible and guys so here I am you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.050
 really invite to use so I 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.159
 remember that I'm sure ebook is but 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.630
 I think on the wound that it can 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 to be the same thing after that is my 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.570
 ranking it's up to you to do it 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.130
 after that I do not have all my 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.840
 sales success was very worthy manager 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.459
 but in any case I'm trying so here's my 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.409
 so the top 3 is rooney lacazette 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.060
 ruffier so certainly ruffier it has me 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.319
 brought a lot but I sold 28 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.989
 still lacazette it brought me 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.580
 500 84000 relay credit sold 30 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.379
 then there is iniesta that brings a lot 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.780
 this is 10% of the purchase price 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.110
 schweinsteiger is the same 10% of the price 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.030
 purchase minimum sold 18 sanchez 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.710
 it's the same 10% of the purchase price 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.450
 also you see benefits 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.060
 no average purchase price is then 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 falcao cause of art to metz oscars this is 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.940
 suarez who reported a lot watched 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.960
 we will therefore be more profitable because 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.280

 of profits by selling 3 that's huge 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.800
 still then the box helps as I 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.900

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.330
 there are ten per cent profit on each 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.920
