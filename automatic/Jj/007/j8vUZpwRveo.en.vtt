it's really cool it's called the flat
dog<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.600> flat<00:01:58.009> stick<00:01:59.009> bait<00:01:59.219> it's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
dog because it's a flat stick bait it's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.179 
dog because it's a flat stick bait it's
not<00:02:00.180> rounded<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.049> Gary<00:02:01.619> Yamamoto<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
not rounded like the Gary Yamamoto and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.749 
not rounded like the Gary Yamamoto and
stuff<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.210> actually<00:02:03.270> completely<00:02:03.869> flat

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
stuff it's actually completely flat

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.490 
stuff it's actually completely flat
which<00:02:05.759> makes<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.750> unique

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
which makes it really really unique

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.010 
which makes it really really unique
because<00:02:08.190> when<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.580> wacky<00:02:08.940> rigging<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.420> which

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
because when your wacky rigging it which

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.869 
because when your wacky rigging it which
is<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> best<00:02:10.470> way<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
is the best way to do it it's going to

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
is the best way to do it it's going to
displace<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.510> water<00:02:12.569> you've<00:02:13.319> all

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
displace more water you've all

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
displace more water you've all
got<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.860> curl<00:02:14.160> tear<00:02:14.459> tail<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.209> which<00:02:15.330> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
got this curl tear tail here which is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.990 
got this curl tear tail here which is
that<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.630> mistake<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.800> meant<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.489> be<00:02:17.610> doing

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that a mistake it was meant to be doing

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.089 
that a mistake it was meant to be doing
that<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.720> way<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.140> when<00:02:19.349> it's<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.650> curve

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
that so that way and when it's a curve

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.740 
that so that way and when it's a curve
like<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.340> don't<00:02:20.670> even<00:02:21.000> give<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.239> more<00:02:21.360> action

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
like that don't even give it more action

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.650 
like that don't even give it more action
they've<00:02:22.440> also<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:23.060> bumps<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.270> to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
they've also got this bumps in it to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.870 
they've also got this bumps in it to
even<00:02:24.780> displace<00:02:25.200> more<00:02:25.349> water<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.160> people<00:02:26.760> say

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
even displace more water so people say

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.580 
even displace more water so people say
it<00:02:26.970> breaks<00:02:27.150> easily<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.110> catches<00:02:28.260> fish

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
it breaks easily but it catches fish

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.559 
it breaks easily but it catches fish
you've<00:02:29.250> got<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.520> splat<00:02:29.760> design<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.420> it's

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
you've got the splat design and it's

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.850 
you've got the splat design and it's
just<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.019> lot<00:02:31.260> more<00:02:31.290> effective

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
just going to be a lot more effective

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.430 
just going to be a lot more effective

pumpkin seed this is a forum debate it's
really<00:02:51.840> really<00:02:52.049> unique<00:02:52.380> I've<00:02:52.890> never<00:02:53.040> seen<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
really really unique I've never seen a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.140 
really really unique I've never seen a
bait<00:02:53.489> like<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.790> before<00:02:54.019> deputies<00:02:55.019> know<00:02:55.319> like

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
bait like it before deputies know like

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.089 
bait like it before deputies know like
but<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.269> makes<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.600> unique<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.739> tail<00:02:58.950> on

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
but what makes it unique is the tail on

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.240 
but what makes it unique is the tail on
it<00:02:59.840> till<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.590> doesn't<00:03:01.769> look<00:03:01.980> unique

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
it till here to you doesn't look unique

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.430 
it till here to you doesn't look unique
but<00:03:02.549> it's<00:03:02.580> actually<00:03:02.819> packed<00:03:03.569> with<00:03:03.870> salt<00:03:04.170> so

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
but it's actually packed with salt so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.520 
but it's actually packed with salt so
then<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.640> dual<00:03:05.819> density<00:03:06.030> plastic<00:03:06.959> which

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
then it's a dual density plastic which

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.620 
then it's a dual density plastic which
means<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.160> back<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.610> actually<00:03:08.970> heavier<00:03:09.330> than

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
means the back is actually heavier than

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.780 
means the back is actually heavier than
the<00:03:09.840> front<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.890> that's<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.400> make<00:03:11.519> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the front so that's going to make the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.050 
the front so that's going to make the
bait<00:03:12.299> slide<00:03:12.959> backwards<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.670> you're<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
bait slide backwards so you're going to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.550 
bait slide backwards so you're going to
Texas<00:03:15.420> rig<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.690> with<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> two-out<00:03:16.080> hook<00:03:16.349> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
Texas rig this with a two-out hook and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.750 
Texas rig this with a two-out hook and
it's<00:03:16.680> going<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.830> slide<00:03:17.010> backwards<00:03:17.459> into<00:03:17.609> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it's going to slide backwards into the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.270 
it's going to slide backwards into the
the<00:03:18.239> badge<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.109> say<00:03:19.290> beds<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> be

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
the badge I say beds this is going to be

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.789 
the badge I say beds this is going to be
a<00:03:20.310> great<00:03:20.459> bad<00:03:20.700> fishing<00:03:20.970> bait<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.380> cast<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
a great bad fishing bait so you cast it

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.930 
a great bad fishing bait so you cast it
right<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.010> front<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.190> them<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:23.790> keep

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
right in front of them and you just keep

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.220 
right in front of them and you just keep
digging<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.570> will<00:03:24.660> keep<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:25.049> like<00:03:25.170> that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
digging it and will keep going like that

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
digging it and will keep going like that
into<00:03:25.590> their<00:03:25.739> bed<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.100> don't<00:03:26.459> really<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.820> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
into their bed I don't really get the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.840 
into their bed I don't really get the
bass<00:03:27.450> mad<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.320> that's<00:03:29.190> great<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.609> it's<00:03:29.730> also

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
bass mad so that's great and it's also

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.030 
bass mad so that's great and it's also
got<00:03:30.030> these<00:03:30.180> nice<00:03:30.480> nice<00:03:30.900> legs<00:03:31.230> on<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.470> that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
got these nice nice legs on it that

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.460 
got these nice nice legs on it that
actually<00:03:32.370> glide<00:03:32.670> really<00:03:33.060> well<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.420> water

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.930 

so<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.530> got<00:03:40.680> three<00:03:40.920> different<00:03:41.040> dates<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.850> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
so I got three different dates is just a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940 
so I got three different dates is just a
bunch<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.180> colors<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.480> each<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:43.350> last<00:03:43.590> like
