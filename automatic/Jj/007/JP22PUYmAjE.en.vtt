00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.450 
so aside from the no stickers it sucks
so<00:06:31.570> over<00:06:31.930> here<00:06:32.380> you<00:06:32.560> can<00:06:32.950> tell<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.250> there's

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
so over here you can tell that there's

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.310 
so over here you can tell that there's
two<00:06:33.610> weight<00:06:33.789> disks<00:06:34.150> yep<00:06:34.930> like<00:06:35.740> I<00:06:35.860> said<00:06:35.919> blood

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
two weight disks yep like I said blood

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.180 
two weight disks yep like I said blood
oh<00:06:38.320> okay

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
oh okay

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.070 
oh okay
here's<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.640> bottom<00:06:40.000> it<00:06:40.450> looks<00:06:40.600> almost

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
here's the bottom it looks almost

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.529 
here's the bottom it looks almost
identical<00:06:41.640> except<00:06:42.640> this<00:06:42.760> is<00:06:42.940> a<00:06:43.030> darker<00:06:43.360> shade

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
identical except this is a darker shade

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.230 
identical except this is a darker shade
of<00:06:43.690> grey<00:06:43.930> and<00:06:44.220> has<00:06:45.220> different<00:06:45.460> stickers<00:06:45.820> and

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
of grey and has different stickers and

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.240 
of grey and has different stickers and
the<00:06:46.780> fact<00:06:47.020> that<00:06:47.110> there's<00:06:47.410> no<00:06:47.590> rubber<00:06:47.800> so<00:06:48.100> it's

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
the fact that there's no rubber so it's

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.550 
the fact that there's no rubber so it's
absolutely<00:06:48.820> useless<00:06:49.120> now<00:06:49.479> Dada

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
absolutely useless now Dada

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.600 
absolutely useless now Dada
and<00:06:51.510> the<00:06:52.510> difference<00:06:52.930> I<00:06:53.260> think<00:06:53.289> is<00:06:54.070> that<00:06:54.280> this

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
and the difference I think is that this

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.420 
and the difference I think is that this
right<00:06:54.910> spin<00:06:55.180> now<00:06:55.360> and<00:06:55.600> this<00:06:56.050> is<00:06:56.260> all<00:06:56.560> this<00:06:57.220> is

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
right spin now and this is all this is

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.990 
right spin now and this is all this is
left<00:06:57.669> spin<00:06:58.020> so<00:06:59.020> yeah<00:06:59.590> if<00:07:00.520> you<00:07:00.669> didn't<00:07:00.850> know

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
left spin so yeah if you didn't know

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.409 
left spin so yeah if you didn't know
that

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
that

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.150 
that
Dragoon's<00:07:02.020> all<00:07:02.229> of<00:07:02.380> them<00:07:02.530> are<00:07:02.710> less<00:07:02.919> spin

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
Dragoon's all of them are less spin

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.210 
Dragoon's all of them are less spin
except<00:07:03.430> grip<00:07:03.610> attacker<00:07:04.240> so<00:07:05.050> yeah<00:07:05.590> let's<00:07:06.039> see

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220
