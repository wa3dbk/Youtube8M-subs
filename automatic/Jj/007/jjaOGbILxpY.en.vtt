00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello people to come down to another video of me this is through 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.320
 the Mac App asylum in Germany the game costs 90 cents and gives it too 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.929
 for the same price for the iPhone the iPad and the iPod Touch and that 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.120
 it is not only on buildings that he can not only play with musicians and exhibitors 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.670
 and then, of course, climbed last time to come out and indeed there 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.539
 it now here four different missions and in the life of this one 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.390
 to the island of the world but it strengthens 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 and in the last one, that's the end of the city again 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.210
 some easier fifa-referee 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.390
 and with it that the disturbances are with each other with the time that we are with 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.720
 this bus at the taxes 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.100
 and now it had to be one for this vehicle but this was the etch 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.370
 Company can rent is the service provider for me turn and also 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.760
 from Vattenfall 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.890
 and we have to look for some of these boxes here so worried these 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.230
 Wooden boxes year on this traffic pulled Jazyk troops, so to speak 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.330
 and so Jung, there are now three pieces Centers this year you here 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.960
 and altogether miracles are arguing that it's our step we still have 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.140
 and when he says empty Manser quickly created you can not do more 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.250
 continue 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.059
 so that there is a time limit when I set terrorism under 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.850
 especially Peter Bofinger 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.340
 trying to impress nature the safest 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 there is still relatively easy here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.610
 even if we did not care if I could get one with the hoe and the Guido box 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.110
 Kuhlmann that I mean simply that is reasonably correct prevention 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 Albtrauf lies and then maybe there would not be a latter 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.990
 yes in the end we had to lie right and that every step is lonely 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 that would be high 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630
 but we are looking forward to it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 so they can continue 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 and here you can also testers 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.250
 I do not want to judge this 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.710
 and this machine is still there and that carried it to the correct one, so to speak 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.710
 position 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.340
 and then met shortly thereafter 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.750
 so are these contracts 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.750
 from here still unpublished obstacle that has nothing to say 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.369
 and thus never completely repeals 2012 newspaper 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.300
 so and then about this time "Once you have done well, you have it 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.020
 managed the assortment to the most essential Clark on that is 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.499
 normal 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.519
 and that reminds me that is a process that was correct and then you have that 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.279
 made 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.799
 I say a bit harder, for example, we all love partly 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.839
 Members do not quickly eliminate each one but it always gets a bit different 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.279
 and if it is so here you are moving those boxes and who his property 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.279
 fly around so somehow miss that is not allowed 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.060
 and then 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.020
 yes these all these things on the ship fine left and right and 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.979
 here 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.969
 and ultimately a bit more difficult and the water again a lot 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.429
 save more Well that means more fun to use it Â»Loosli lives then goes 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.059
 also sick for a bit longer 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.839
 and that was really cool for me 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.469
 Intended to lay down again with stones between the titles 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.719
 and then we color it so extensions the outskirts white offers the 12th 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.299
 and then I can imagine such a chain Federal Republic so this stone August 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.349
 within this 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.540
 you have to push through those but you have to be careful when the boxes are 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.659
 height 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.699
 then you look at the statistics, is it way or when a vehicle comes by itself 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.699
 and you did not make time either 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.969
 And yes, that's what Mark Kirchner does as a title with a chain 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:13.839
 have been 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.410
 who am I this infarction 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.389
 then one did not succeed 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.639
 and the game really offers a lot of variety through countless elements 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.309
 the turnip Rome - which you will learn what is transported around 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.769
 and that appreciated so I would be very much of and I think so 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.849
 Show everything correctly that would take too long 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.039
 and that makes the whole thing really different 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.009
 should have these steps that I had just mentioned though is 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.949
 the goal and have to be different this is not about Christoph then certain 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.090
 Position 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.170
 Such a seven year old one would like to meet all of this on this one 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.779
 Container or window cleaning truck stop 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.410
 charge and that works too 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.969
 just as limited is that it runs wrong 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.099
 for other formats essential traffic is receive no castor transports on 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.389
 One for this Friday on a please a little harder because it is easy 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:58.999
 not so 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.669
 So angular is itself what behavior quite different form we have to 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.559
 definitely have a side blow on the beer tables done 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.229
 and at Fulda percent to 1 31 made 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:12.249
 and also the sales grew waiting taxi goes so was the whole heard 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.469
 abolished 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.789
 or just have to pack cars so eyes have risen 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.389
 the son drive in free parking the whole thing is going to be pretty much like that 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.019
 different sizes of her 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.129
 the goal is a box 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.830
 and that was the special of its absence Weichert 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.580
 and I have to be everything it gets very very difficult so it's not like that 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.610
 simply the player could bank themselves together closely 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.620
 and not at all 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.340
 it is the film criticism and because it has to have a good level 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.419
 also boring 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.009
 but I can well imagine that one or the other is not so good 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.060
 but i'm disappointed docu will be but i am that 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.300
 a really great game especially in the Alps varied levels 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.240
 "This test gives a very large number of companies a very long time 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.879
 reported 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.550
 is very difficult and if the game has already fallen for a desk and so on 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.529
 Demel that they definitely liked and therefore I can reach the goal and 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.580
 and yes, that's what more reports to see and only
