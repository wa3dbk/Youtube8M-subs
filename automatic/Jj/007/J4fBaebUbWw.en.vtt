00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.440 
up going with the blue LEDs inside only
because<00:01:24.400> I<00:01:24.430> thought<00:01:24.730> it<00:01:24.850> looked<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.150> little<00:01:25.270> bit

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
because I thought it looked a little bit

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.180 
because I thought it looked a little bit
better<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:27.120> so<00:01:28.120> I'd<00:01:29.110> had<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.650> did<00:01:29.980> read

before and I was getting kind of bored
with<00:01:31.660> red<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.290> went<00:01:32.740> with<00:01:32.890> back<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.130> blue<00:01:34.050> so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
with red so I went with back to blue so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.720 
with red so I went with back to blue so
there<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.680> LEDs<00:01:36.010> are<00:01:36.160> really<00:01:36.340> easy<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.700> change

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
there the LEDs are really easy to change

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.690

top<00:02:26.870> got<00:02:27.620> an<00:02:27.739> Rx<00:02:28.269> 240<00:02:29.269> X<00:02:29.420> s<00:02:29.629> PC<00:02:30.050> radiator<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
top got an Rx 240 X s PC radiator in the

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.259 
top got an Rx 240 X s PC radiator in the
bottom<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.030> my<00:02:32.900> loop<00:02:33.110> order<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.730> follows

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
bottom and my loop order is as follows

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.850 
bottom and my loop order is as follows
so<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.540> go<00:02:35.720> out<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.989> my<00:02:36.080> res<00:02:36.489> into<00:02:37.489> my<00:02:38.319> pump<00:02:39.319> out

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
so I go out of my res into my pump out

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.190 
so I go out of my res into my pump out
of<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.190> pump<00:02:40.519> into<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.000> lower<00:02:41.239> rod<00:02:41.599> out<00:02:42.140> of

of the pump into the lower rod out of

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.850 
of the pump into the lower rod out of
the<00:02:42.410> rat<00:02:42.620> into<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.190> GPU<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> GPU<00:02:45.680> into

the rat into the GPU out of the GPU into

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.490 
the rat into the GPU out of the GPU into
the<00:02:45.980> CPU<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.760> then<00:02:47.269> out<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.810> CPU<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.260> top

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
the CPU and then out of the CPU the top

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.759 
the CPU and then out of the CPU the top
right<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:48.799> then<00:02:49.160> back<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.670> reservoir

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
right and then back to the reservoir

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.920 
right and then back to the reservoir
another<00:02:51.769> thing<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.069> did<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.209> inside<00:02:53.569> here

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
another thing I did on the inside here

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.640 
another thing I did on the inside here
you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.349> see<00:02:54.590> I've<00:02:54.920> got<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:56.200> fan<00:02:57.200> controller

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
you can see I've got a fan controller

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.970 
you can see I've got a fan controller
this<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.099> century<00:02:58.880> mesh<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.420> believe<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.140> I

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
this is a century mesh I believe and I

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.190 
this is a century mesh I believe and I
put<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.849> on<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.060> inside<00:03:02.360> only<00:03:02.840> because<00:03:03.170> I

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
put it on the inside only because I

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.350 
put it on the inside only because I
don't<00:03:03.440> really<00:03:03.709> change<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.670> fan<00:03:04.879> speeds<00:03:05.180> that

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
don't really change the fan speeds that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.610 
don't really change the fan speeds that
much<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.750> usually<00:03:06.019> keep<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.470> lowest

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
much I usually keep it at the lowest

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.710 
much I usually keep it at the lowest
settings<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.849> thought<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> front<00:03:08.390> panel

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
settings and I thought the front panel

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.050 
settings and I thought the front panel
looked<00:03:08.900> much<00:03:09.110> nicer<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> clean<00:03:10.670> look<00:03:10.879> like

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
looked much nicer with a clean look like

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.880 
looked much nicer with a clean look like
that<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.440> just<00:03:12.739> put<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:14.440> fan<00:03:15.440> controller

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
that so I just put that fan controller

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.789 
that so I just put that fan controller
in<00:03:16.069> there<00:03:16.310> now<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.450> through<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.530> can<00:03:18.560> see

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
in there now going through you can see

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.949 
in there now going through you can see
I've<00:03:18.920> got<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.220> race<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.910> race<00:03:20.180> storm<00:03:20.660> blocks

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
I've got the race the race storm blocks

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.069 
I've got the race the race storm blocks
on<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.290> CPU<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.980> GPU<00:03:22.750> well<00:03:23.750> actually<00:03:23.930> I

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
on the CPU and the GPU well actually I

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.050 
on the CPU and the GPU well actually I
think<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.290> GPU<00:03:24.620> block<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:25.040> called<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.459> razor

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
think the GPU block is called a razor

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.280 
think the GPU block is called a razor
block<00:03:26.540> that's<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.829> GTX<00:03:28.459> 680<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.930> card<00:03:30.200> I'm

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
block that's for a GTX 680 the card I'm

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.819 
block that's for a GTX 680 the card I'm
running<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.880> GTX<00:03:31.880> 670<00:03:32.480> for<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.200> win<00:03:33.349> Edition

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
running is a GTX 670 for the win Edition

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.140 
running is a GTX 670 for the win Edition

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
MSI and power motherboard and I got rid

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.580 
MSI and power motherboard and I got rid
of<00:04:03.139> those<00:04:03.290> yellow<00:04:03.500> accents<00:04:03.980> with<00:04:04.400> some<00:04:05.590> silver

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
of those yellow accents with some silver

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.640 
of those yellow accents with some silver
brushed<00:04:07.519> metal<00:04:07.819> type<00:04:08.239> film<00:04:09.019> that<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.319> just

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
brushed metal type film that I just

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.610 
brushed metal type film that I just
stuck<00:04:10.099> over<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.579> yellow<00:04:11.060> sections<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.370> you

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
stuck over the yellow sections and you

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.400 
stuck over the yellow sections and you
see<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.950> turned<00:04:14.459> out<00:04:14.580> really<00:04:14.819> well<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
see it turned out really well and so the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.580 
see it turned out really well and so the
PSU<00:04:19.410> that's<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.889> Corsair<00:04:20.880> ax<00:04:22.130> 650<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:25.080> that's<00:04:25.410> my

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
PSU that's a Corsair ax 650 so that's my

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.810 
PSU that's a Corsair ax 650 so that's my
build<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.520> just<00:04:27.060> wanted<00:04:27.389> to<00:04:27.449> show<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.780> guys

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
build and I just wanted to show you guys

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.150 
build and I just wanted to show you guys
the<00:04:29.820> build<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.240> its<00:04:30.389> entirety<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:32.010> know

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
the build and its entirety and you know

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.409 
the build and its entirety and you know
I've<00:04:32.280> been<00:04:32.340> having<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.850> running<00:04:33.150> up<00:04:33.300> and

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
I've been having it running up and

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.320 
I've been having it running up and
running<00:04:33.690> for<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:35.130> little<00:04:35.639> while<00:04:35.790> now<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.030> it's

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
running for a little while now and it's

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.840 
running for a little while now and it's
run<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:36.810> runs<00:04:37.020> real<00:04:37.260> good<00:04:37.610> temperatures<00:04:38.610> stay

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
run it runs real good temperatures stay

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.530 
run it runs real good temperatures stay
nice<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.090> cool<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:40.639> I<00:04:41.639> don't<00:04:42.030> really<00:04:42.240> have<00:04:42.419> to

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
nice and cool and I don't really have to

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.950 
nice and cool and I don't really have to
turn<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.750> fans<00:04:43.050> up<00:04:43.229> very<00:04:43.500> much<00:04:44.210> right<00:04:45.210> now<00:04:45.419> in<00:04:45.780> my

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
turn a fans up very much right now in my

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.740 
turn a fans up very much right now in my
garage<00:04:46.169> it's<00:04:46.650> about<00:04:46.889> 80<00:04:47.220> degrees<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:48.180> of

garage it's about 80 degrees and of

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.350 
garage it's about 80 degrees and of
course<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.169> just<00:04:49.229> idling<00:04:49.590> but<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.120> see

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
course it's just idling but you can see

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.240 
course it's just idling but you can see
it's<00:04:52.039> running<00:04:53.039> them<00:04:53.370> round<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:55.039> don't<00:04:56.039> know<00:04:56.160> if

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
it's running them round I don't know if

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.490 
it's running them round I don't know if
you<00:04:56.340> guys<00:04:56.490> can<00:04:56.729> see<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:56.970> but<00:04:57.360> it's<00:04:57.539> in<00:04:57.720> it's

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
you guys can see that but it's in it's

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.120 
you guys can see that but it's in it's
at<00:04:58.650> 34<00:04:59.190> right<00:04:59.370> now<00:04:59.780> like<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.900> said<00:05:01.080> it's<00:05:01.350> uh<00:05:01.440> it's

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
at 34 right now like I said it's uh it's

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.469 
at 34 right now like I said it's uh it's
about<00:05:02.250> eighty<00:05:02.520> degrees<00:05:02.910> in<00:05:03.090> here<00:05:03.240> right<00:05:03.449> now

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
about eighty degrees in here right now

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.500 
about eighty degrees in here right now
so<00:05:03.960> it's<00:05:04.169> pretty<00:05:04.350> warm<00:05:05.120> Computers<00:05:06.120> been<00:05:06.300> on

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
so it's pretty warm Computers been on

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.960 
so it's pretty warm Computers been on
just<00:05:07.110> idling<00:05:07.530> for<00:05:07.770> for<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.400> little<00:05:08.580> while<00:05:08.729> now

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
just idling for for a little while now

probably high 50s on the CPU when it's
hot<00:05:21.330> out<00:05:21.479> like<00:05:21.690> this<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.169> then<00:05:23.160> jumping<00:05:23.940> up

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
hot out like this and then jumping up

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.690 
hot out like this and then jumping up
close<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.479> 70<00:05:24.720> on<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.139> GPU<00:05:25.590> if<00:05:25.889> I<00:05:26.039> have<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.550> I'm

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
my max that I've seen is about 64 which

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.870 
my max that I've seen is about 64 which
isn't<00:05:33.630> really<00:05:33.930> bad<00:05:34.050> on<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.590> GPU<00:05:34.979> considering

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
isn't really bad on the GPU considering

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.600 
isn't really bad on the GPU considering
I've<00:05:36.000> got<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> CPU<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.690> GPU<00:05:36.750> on<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:38.550> same<00:05:38.789> loop<00:05:39.030> so

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
I've got a CPU a GPU on the same loop so

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.189 
I've got a CPU a GPU on the same loop so
I'll<00:05:41.610> go<00:05:41.789> ahead<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.180> cut<00:05:42.419> this<00:05:42.630> off<00:05:42.900> here<00:05:43.169> I

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
I'll go ahead and cut this off here I

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.960 
I'll go ahead and cut this off here I
just<00:05:43.260> wanted<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.830> give<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:44.099> guys<00:05:44.160> an<00:05:44.460> overview

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
just wanted to give you guys an overview

just wanted to give you guys an overview
quick<00:05:45.840> overview<00:05:46.349> on<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.770> C<00:05:47.099> 70<00:05:47.430> build<00:05:47.639> that<00:05:47.820> I

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
quick overview on the C 70 build that I

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.930 
quick overview on the C 70 build that I
did<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:49.110> was<00:05:49.620> planning<00:05:50.220> on<00:05:50.310> doing<00:05:50.370> some<00:05:50.820> more

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
did I was planning on doing some more

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.450 
did I was planning on doing some more
mods<00:05:51.150> on<00:05:51.360> this<00:05:51.479> but<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.990> got<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.650> using<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.070> PC

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
mods on this but I got to using the PC

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.430 
mods on this but I got to using the PC
and<00:05:53.639> I<00:05:53.789> couldn't<00:05:54.120> afford<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:54.840> take<00:05:55.169> it<00:05:55.320> back

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
and I couldn't afford to take it back

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.029 
and I couldn't afford to take it back
down<00:05:55.650> again

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
down again

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.790 
down again
so<00:05:56.250> those<00:05:56.610> mods<00:05:56.880> kind<00:05:57.180> of<00:05:57.300> got<00:05:57.419> pushed<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.990> the

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
so those mods kind of got pushed to the

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.350 
so those mods kind of got pushed to the
side<00:05:59.039> but<00:05:59.310> maybe<00:05:59.580> one<00:05:59.789> of<00:05:59.880> these<00:06:00.000> days<00:06:00.210> I'll

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
side but maybe one of these days I'll

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.140 
side but maybe one of these days I'll
finish<00:06:00.539> this<00:06:00.810> one<00:06:01.050> off<00:06:01.550> but<00:06:02.550> thanks<00:06:03.120> for

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
finish this one off but thanks for

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150 
finish this one off but thanks for
watching<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.840> hope<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.710> get<00:06:04.889> some<00:06:05.070> more

watching and hope to get some more

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.630 
watching and hope to get some more
videos<00:06:05.490> out<00:06:05.610> for<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:05.910> soon<00:06:06.120> thanks
