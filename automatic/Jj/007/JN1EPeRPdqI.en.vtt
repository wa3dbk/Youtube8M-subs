there's step 2 can you read that pause

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.119 
there's step 2 can you read that pause
it<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> large<00:01:01.489> step<00:01:02.489> 3

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
it in a large step 3

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
on the square one us design patty and

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.980 
on the square one us design patty and
somewhere<00:02:05.579> there<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.840> is

somewhere there don't know what that is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.949 
somewhere there don't know what that is
but<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.380> there<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.489> an<00:02:08.640> older<00:02:08.910> puzzle<00:02:09.300> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
but it's there it is an older puzzle so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.140 
but it's there it is an older puzzle so
it<00:02:10.080> has<00:02:10.259> been<00:02:10.500> handled<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it has been handled so you do have to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.020 
it has been handled so you do have to
kind<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> work<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:13.050> get<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
kind of work it to get it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.440 
kind of work it to get it
and<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.590> met<00:02:16.060> just<00:02:17.060> don't<00:02:17.210> have<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
and just just met just don't have the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.510 
and just just met just don't have the
time<00:02:17.780> really<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.410> study<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.980> analyze<00:02:19.100> this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
time really to study and analyze this
