 after 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.589
 face 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.619
 3 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.529
 after 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.109
 face allah drought 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 after 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.239
 the new vote would be good touareg 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.949
 three weeks before his presence at the Geneva fair 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 one of a kind bar 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.070
 two templates remains about the same as the previous one 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.679
 three to four centimeters 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.610
 exactly able to learn from the environment 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.080
 on the other hand 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.530
 he dropped 2 centimeters in height 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.220
 and the width almost similar old 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.590
 which gives it a little more posed look on the road then the three or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.710
 four-centimeter winner sellers profit the German or 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.440
 again 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.350
 finally passers selling seats the 700 liters 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.720
 in the cockpit the big novelty of the new touareg is irresponsible 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.110
 a sliding bench 160 millimeters 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.760
 which allows from before 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.270
 to enjoy a better modularity 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.730
 of course the old 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.850
 the highlight of the show for power and that's its hybrid version one 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.290
 long waited 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.850
 he finally 330 days 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.310
 it's the parallel hybrid you want entirely electric but not 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.750
 long time 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.080
 it has a box the reports or automatic 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.100
 as on the new audi a8 consumption is in less than nine 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.010
 minutes 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.580
 exactly 185 grams of CO2 per km which makes a little discomfort and for the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.220
 price 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.630
 we do not know 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.080
 for the engine 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.370
 at launch 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.420
 we obviously have the hybrid as a novelty on the other hand vanishes from the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.620
 catalog 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.710
 tdi around 5am we will not look too much 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 it will be replaced by a tight bestseller at the end of the year for the rest of 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.550
 the range of engines it evolves not bateman eq the heart of the range the v6 tdi 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.869
 240 horses 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.399
 vast program virtually unchanged the second-generation Tuareg 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.979
 arriving in France 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.049
 at the earliest beginning of May and at the latest at the end of July 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.939
 so we'll say at the beginning of the summer 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.849
 no 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.109
 it's sad
