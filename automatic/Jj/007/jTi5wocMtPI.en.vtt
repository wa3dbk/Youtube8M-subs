studio<00:02:00.710> there's<00:02:01.710> no<00:02:01.829> idea<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.189> they're<00:02:02.369> making

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
studio there's no idea if they're making

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.429 
studio there's no idea if they're making
all-stars<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:04.200> probably

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
all-stars to or not they probably

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.560 
all-stars to or not they probably
weren't<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> they're<00:02:05.640> probably<00:02:05.909> focusing<00:02:06.420> on

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
weren't and they're probably focusing on

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.850 
weren't and they're probably focusing on
the<00:02:06.659> new<00:02:06.840> UFC<00:02:07.170> game<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:09.229> all<00:02:10.229> starts<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the new UFC game but it all starts to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080 
the new UFC game but it all starts to
would<00:02:11.129> have<00:02:11.220> been<00:02:11.370> all

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
would have been all

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.900 
would have been all
to<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.480> weapons<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.319> more<00:02:13.470> combos<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.340> being

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
to have weapons and more combos in being

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
able to combo finishes together so you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.500 
able to combo finishes together so you
could<00:02:17.040> hit<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.280> superkick<00:02:17.730> even<00:02:18.000> cook<00:02:18.209> but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
could hit the superkick even cook but

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.000 
could hit the superkick even cook but
it's<00:02:18.629> straight<00:02:18.840> into<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.140> pedigree<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.890> all

it's straight into the pedigree and all

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.500 
it's straight into the pedigree and all
about<00:02:20.280> greatness<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:23.670> don't<00:02:23.879> get<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> c1
