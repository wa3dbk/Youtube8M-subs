00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
on the outside and I use a red tying
thread<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> people<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.350> black<00:00:58.649> tying

thread a lot of people use black tying
thread<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.399> prefer<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> red<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> don't

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
thread I just prefer the red I don't

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
thread I just prefer the red I don't
know<00:01:00.390> why<00:01:00.570> maybe<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.350> shows<00:01:01.500> up

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
know why maybe I think it shows up

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
know why maybe I think it shows up
better<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> water<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.120> going

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
better in the water so we're just going

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.210 
better in the water so we're just going
to<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.629> ahead<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.159> wind<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.489> our<00:01:05.670> mylar<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
to go ahead and wind in our mylar just

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
to go ahead and wind in our mylar just
just<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.970> wind<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> forward<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
just like so just wind that forward and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.120 
just like so just wind that forward and
I<00:01:11.040> wouldn't<00:01:11.369> keep<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.930> wines<00:01:13.560> nice<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I wouldn't keep the the wines nice and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.120 
I wouldn't keep the the wines nice and
tight<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> overlap<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.500> maybe

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
tight I also kind of overlap them maybe

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.149 
tight I also kind of overlap them maybe
by<00:01:17.369> half<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> figure<00:01:20.100> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
by half or so just kind of figure that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.230 
by half or so just kind of figure that
it<00:01:20.570> makes<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:21.840> durable<00:01:22.049> fly<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.240> once

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it makes it more durable fly and once

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
it makes it more durable fly and once
again<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> 15<00:01:25.619> pound<00:01:25.979> monofilament

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
again we use that 15 pound monofilament

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.999 
again we use that 15 pound monofilament
line<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.360> over<00:01:27.750> wrap<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.320> body<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
line to over wrap this body and that

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
line to over wrap this body and that
once<00:01:29.250> again<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.000> more<00:01:30.150> durable<00:01:30.390> as

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
once again will make it more durable as

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
once again will make it more durable as
well<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.320> those<00:01:31.409> fish<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.860> their<00:01:32.009> teeth

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
well so when those fish get their teeth

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
well so when those fish get their teeth
into<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.790> won't<00:01:32.909> tear<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
into it they won't tear the thing to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.710 
into it they won't tear the thing to
shreds<00:01:34.130> just<00:01:35.130> tie<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:35.970> couple

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720

so find that in nice and tight
leave<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.160> long<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.959> about<00:03:43.019> right<00:03:43.379> this<00:03:43.980> is

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
leave that long it's about right this is

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.009 
leave that long it's about right this is
a<00:03:44.160> case<00:03:44.459> where<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.030> want<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.389> pretty<00:03:45.629> sparse

a case where you want a pretty sparse

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.990 
a case where you want a pretty sparse
fly<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.709> good<00:03:47.160> case<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.400> where<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.849> less

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
fly it's a good case of where and less

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.759 
fly it's a good case of where and less
is<00:03:48.180> more

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
is more

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.830 
is more
well<00:03:49.769> those<00:03:50.310> are<00:03:50.519> gone<00:03:50.699> get<00:03:51.510> rid<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.690> those

guys don't want no stragglers you can

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.729 
guys don't want no stragglers you can
actually<00:03:54.629> pull<00:03:54.840> those<00:03:54.989> back<00:03:55.019> if<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.530> feel

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
you've tied them too tight and then the

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.089 
you've tied them too tight and then the
very<00:03:58.440> top<00:03:58.709> over<00:03:59.129> wing<00:03:59.310> is<00:04:00.049> balloon<00:04:01.049> buck<00:04:01.859> tail

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
very top over wing is balloon buck tail

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.159 
very top over wing is balloon buck tail
and<00:04:02.489> then<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.299> gonna<00:04:03.419> be<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.659> little<00:04:03.840> longer

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
and then that's gonna be a little longer

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.439 
and then that's gonna be a little longer
yet<00:04:04.590> maybe<00:04:04.799> just<00:04:05.129> just<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.639> tad<00:04:05.849> longer<00:04:06.090> than

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
yet maybe just just a tad longer than

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.899 
yet maybe just just a tad longer than
the<00:04:06.599> Green<00:04:06.840> Wing<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.840> tie<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.109> in<00:04:10.699> get<00:04:11.699> back

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909
