00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.380 

the<00:00:41.940> 2015<00:00:42.510> Dodge<00:00:42.810> Challenger<00:00:43.440> SRT<00:00:44.280> Hellcat

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
the 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
the 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat
offers<00:00:45.390> more<00:00:45.629> than<00:00:45.920> 125<00:00:46.920> potential

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
offers more than 125 potential

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:59.079 
offers more than 125 potential
configurations<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> let's<00:00:50.760> release<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> tiny

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.130 

it's<00:01:00.089> like<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.390> color<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> being<00:01:00.900> sort<00:01:01.110> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it's like the color of being sort of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.369 
it's like the color of being sort of
analog<00:01:01.730> whereas<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.690> digital

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
analog whereas this is this is a digital

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.340 
analog whereas this is this is a digital
system<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> system<00:01:07.050> like<00:01:07.200> this

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
system so it with a system like this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
system so it with a system like this
it's<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.880> inherently<00:01:08.880> able<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.570> achieve

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
it's it's inherently able to achieve

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.680 
it's it's inherently able to achieve
better<00:01:10.950> road-holding<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.150> mechanically

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
better road-holding than a mechanically

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:30.770 
better road-holding than a mechanically
linked<00:01:12.960> system

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:52.480

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.490 

here<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:51.370> go<00:03:51.520> oh<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:55.570> it's<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:55.840> freakin
