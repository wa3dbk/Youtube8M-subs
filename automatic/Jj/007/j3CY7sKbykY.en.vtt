compared<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> average<00:00:33.540> YouTube<00:00:34.079> content<00:00:34.559> but

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
compared to average YouTube content but

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
compared to average YouTube content but
it's<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.180> lot<00:00:36.420> louder<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
it's about to get a lot louder and you
can<00:00:37.800> judge<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.340> yourself<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:39.239> unfortunate

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
can judge for yourself it's unfortunate

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900 
can judge for yourself it's unfortunate
the<00:00:40.020> make<00:00:40.379> foreign<00:00:40.620> position<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.550> next

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
the make foreign position is right next

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
the make foreign position is right next
to<00:00:42.120> where<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.360> am<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> moment<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.920> first

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to where I am at the moment so the first

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.100 
to where I am at the moment so the first
thing<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> try<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.730> this

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
thing I'm going to try is this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.880 
thing I'm going to try is this
suspicious-looking<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.530> microphone

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
suspicious-looking little microphone

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
suspicious-looking little microphone
which<00:00:47.039> looks<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> jack<00:00:48.090> plug<00:00:48.329> which

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
which looks just like a jack plug which

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.420 
which looks just like a jack plug which
someone<00:00:49.140> has<00:00:49.379> glued<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> microphone<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
someone has glued a microphone into the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.000 
someone has glued a microphone into the
end<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.050> tuck<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> wires<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
end of and then just tuck the wires in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
end of and then just tuck the wires in
and<00:00:53.160> pushed<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.520> shut<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.050> looking<00:00:55.050> online

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and pushed it shut and looking online

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750 
and pushed it shut and looking online
there<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:55.980> jack<00:00:56.280> plugs<00:00:56.579> are

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
there so that these jack plugs are

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
there so that these jack plugs are
available<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> four<00:00:58.320> pins

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
available for the with the four pins

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
available for the with the four pins
that<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:58.949> used<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> iPad<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.329> that's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that are used in the iPad so that's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.819 
that are used in the iPad so that's
probably<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
probably what it is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.160 
probably what it is
so<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.600> gonna<00:01:03.719> try<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.019> one

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
so this is there I'm gonna try this one

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
so this is there I'm gonna try this one
first<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.549> plugged<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
first so it's going to get plugged in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
first so it's going to get plugged in
now<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.950> you'll<00:01:11.280> hear<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> couple<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> clicks

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
now and you'll hear a couple of clicks

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
now and you'll hear a couple of clicks
as<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> iPad<00:01:12.720> recognizes<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.619> microphone

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
as the iPad recognizes and microphone

as the iPad recognizes and microphone
and<00:01:14.070> does<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.400> tests<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.750> things

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and does some tests and then things

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
and does some tests and then things
should<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> lot<00:01:16.500> louder<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.640> and

will go quite quiet and that's the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
will go quite quiet and that's the
internal<00:01:48.420> microphone<00:01:48.869> again<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> I'll<00:01:50.460> plug

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
internal microphone again and I'll plug

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639 
internal microphone again and I'll plug
this<00:01:50.820> extension<00:01:51.780> lead<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
this extension lead in this is just a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.219 
this extension lead in this is just a
jack<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.759> our<00:01:53.880> socket<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> plug<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.950> and

down my chest just to see is this going
to<00:02:10.950> still<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.370> ridiculously<00:02:12.180> loud<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.250> I'll

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
to still be ridiculously loud and I'll

to still be ridiculously loud and I'll
let<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.580> guys<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.000> judge<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.330> now<00:02:16.320> could

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
let you guys the judge of that now could

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500 
let you guys the judge of that now could
unplug<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.520> go<00:02:17.580> back<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.120> internal

this<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.610> you'll<00:02:27.540> recognize

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this one and you'll recognize

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.520 
this one and you'll recognize
immediately<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> very

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
immediately there this is a very

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.470 
immediately there this is a very
standard<00:02:31.940> jack<00:02:32.940> body<00:02:33.240> that's<00:02:33.780> used<00:02:34.410> by<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
standard jack body that's used by the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.250 
standard jack body that's used by the
pod<00:02:36.680> type<00:02:38.510> manufacturers<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> product

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
pod type manufacturers that product

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.200 
pod type manufacturers that product
manufacturers<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:41.730> has<00:02:41.970> wires

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
manufacturers so this one has wires

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.820 
manufacturers so this one has wires
coming<00:02:42.510> out<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:42.990> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> end<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
coming out and it's going to the end of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.360 
coming out and it's going to the end of
this<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.730> tiny<00:02:45.030> tiny<00:02:45.890> little<00:02:46.890> I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
this and that is tiny tiny little I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.530 
this and that is tiny tiny little I
should<00:02:47.550> actually<00:02:47.700> move<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.209> where<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.420> can

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
should actually move it to where you can

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.810 
should actually move it to where you can
actually<00:02:48.660> see<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.170> tiny<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.040> little<00:02:50.310> make<00:02:50.520> for

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
actually see it a tiny a little make for

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.050 
actually see it a tiny a little make for
him

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
him

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.820 
him
and<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.810> end<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.110> wire<00:02:52.350> they've<00:02:52.680> just

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
and the end of that wire they've just

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.500 
and the end of that wire they've just
touched<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> wires<00:02:53.459> onto<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.240> put

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
touched the wires onto it and then put

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.420 
touched the wires onto it and then put
heat<00:02:54.720> shrink<00:02:55.020> around<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> whole<00:02:55.440> thing<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
heat shrink around the whole thing and

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:07.460 
heat shrink around the whole thing and
so<00:02:57.000> I'm<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.390> plug<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.930> there<00:03:06.470> and

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
so I'm going to plug this in there and

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
so I'm going to plug this in there and
that's<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.550> make<00:03:08.730> fun<00:03:08.940> down<00:03:09.209> there<00:03:09.420> I'm<00:03:09.510> not

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
that's that make fun down there I'm not

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.449 
that's that make fun down there I'm not
sure<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.870> load<00:03:10.140> that's<00:03:10.380> going<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.190> again

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
sure a load that's going to be but again

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.190 
sure a load that's going to be but again
if<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.700> put<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.030> into<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.480> middle<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
if I put it into this middle of the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.140 
if I put it into this middle of the
chest<00:03:13.410> position<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.190> I'm<00:03:14.670> not<00:03:14.820> sure<00:03:15.030> if

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
chest position and I'm not sure if

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.940 
chest position and I'm not sure if
that's<00:03:15.269> going<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.600> deafeningly<00:03:16.200> loud<00:03:16.290> or

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
that's going to be deafeningly loud or

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.430 
that's going to be deafeningly loud or
it's<00:03:17.730> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> be<00:03:18.030> acceptable<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:19.290> I'm

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
it's going to be acceptable but I'm

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.570 
it's going to be acceptable but I'm
certainly<00:03:19.800> when<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.010> was<00:03:20.100> testing<00:03:20.400> them<00:03:20.489> out

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
certainly when I was testing them out

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.250 
certainly when I was testing them out
there<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.850> thought<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.239> quite<00:03:21.480> loud<00:03:21.720> maybe

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
there I thought it was quite loud maybe

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.650 
there I thought it was quite loud maybe
a<00:03:22.290> wee<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.470> too<00:03:22.670> almost<00:03:23.670> distorting<00:03:24.390> lis<00:03:24.480> loud

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
a wee bit too almost distorting lis loud

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.199 
a wee bit too almost distorting lis loud
so<00:03:26.930> I've<00:03:27.930> done<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> bit<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.620> research<00:03:29.060> there's<00:03:30.060> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
so I've done a bit of research there's a

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.100 
so I've done a bit of research there's a
surprise<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.550> found<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.480> jack

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
surprise and I found that in the jack

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:43.610 
surprise and I found that in the jack
plug<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:41.150> first<00:03:42.150> connection<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:43.140> first<00:03:43.380> band

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
plug the first connection the first band

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.320 
plug the first connection the first band
if<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.010> got<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.459> bands<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.180> down

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
if it's got the the bands that go down

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.750 
if it's got the the bands that go down
like<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.170> then<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.040> pips<00:03:47.580> that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
like this and then this of pips that

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.210 
like this and then this of pips that
goes<00:03:47.910> round<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.360> little<00:03:48.540> tip<00:03:49.730> badly<00:03:50.730> drawn

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
goes round bit little tip badly drawn

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.759 
goes round bit little tip badly drawn
it's<00:03:53.220> divided<00:03:53.700> into<00:03:54.000> four<00:03:54.330> sections<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.620> is

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
it's divided into four sections this is

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.210 
it's divided into four sections this is
a<00:03:55.800> common<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.700> common<00:03:58.220> ground

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
a common it's the common ground

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.130 
a common it's the common ground
connection<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:01.880> this<00:04:02.880> one<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
connection and this one is the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.759 
connection and this one is the
microphone<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:06.120> other<00:04:06.239> two<00:04:06.540> are<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
microphone and the other two are the

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.550 
microphone and the other two are the
left<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.549> right<00:04:08.730> I'm<00:04:08.880> not<00:04:09.000> sure<00:04:09.209> if<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.230> that's

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
left and right I'm not sure if it that's

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.020 
left and right I'm not sure if it that's
left<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:11.130> right<00:04:11.400> or<00:04:11.580> not<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:11.760> the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
left and that's right or not but the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.580 
left and that's right or not but the
main<00:04:12.180> thing<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.510> not<00:04:12.870> really<00:04:13.110> interesting

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
main thing is not really interesting

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.140 
main thing is not really interesting
there<00:04:13.709> was<00:04:13.739> -<00:04:13.980> all<00:04:14.250> I'm<00:04:14.400> really<00:04:14.580> interesting

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
there was - all I'm really interesting

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.820 
there was - all I'm really interesting
is<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.270> common<00:04:15.569> ground<00:04:15.720> connection<00:04:16.260> here<00:04:16.500> and

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
is the common ground connection here and

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.370 
is the common ground connection here and
the<00:04:17.340> microphone<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.270> reckon<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:19.169> if

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
the microphone because I reckon that if

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.330 
the microphone because I reckon that if
you<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.770> got<00:04:19.950> a

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
you just got a

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.480 
you just got a
standard<00:04:21.380> electric<00:04:22.380> make<00:04:22.560> foreign<00:04:22.919> with<00:04:23.280> its

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
standard electric make foreign with its

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.650 
standard electric make foreign with its
pads<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> back<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:26.120> one<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.270> pads<00:04:27.480> is

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
pads in the back and one of the pads is

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.000 
pads in the back and one of the pads is
usually<00:04:27.990> connected<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.710> screen<00:04:28.949> of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
usually connected on to the screen of

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.500 
usually connected on to the screen of
the<00:04:29.130> body<00:04:29.340> that's<00:04:29.550> usually<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:29.940> negative<00:04:30.360> one

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
the body that's usually the negative one

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.350 
the body that's usually the negative one
so<00:04:31.050> if<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.500> went<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:32.460> wired<00:04:32.729> that<00:04:32.850> there

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
so if that went just wired that there

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.510 
so if that went just wired that there
and<00:04:33.630> then<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.470> signal<00:04:34.800> one<00:04:34.889> two<00:04:35.040> there<00:04:35.190> that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
and then the signal one two there that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.100 
and then the signal one two there that
should<00:04:35.729> actually<00:04:35.850> make<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> microphone<00:04:36.690> so<00:04:36.960> it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
should actually make a microphone so it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.860 
should actually make a microphone so it
may<00:04:37.260> be<00:04:37.320> possible<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:38.130> do<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.570> then

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
may be possible to do that and then

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.230 
may be possible to do that and then
maybe<00:04:40.440> even<00:04:40.800> I'm<00:04:41.280> not<00:04:41.490> on<00:04:41.639> percent<00:04:41.940> sure<00:04:42.120> how

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
maybe even I'm not on percent sure how

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.520 
maybe even I'm not on percent sure how
this<00:04:42.360> would<00:04:42.510> work<00:04:42.540> maybe<00:04:43.020> even<00:04:43.350> put<00:04:43.500> a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
this would work maybe even put a

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.330 
this would work maybe even put a
resistor<00:04:43.979> across<00:04:44.010> here<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.699> don't<00:04:45.150> know<00:04:46.340> how

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
resistor across here I don't know how

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.780 
resistor across here I don't know how
much<00:04:48.229> active<00:04:49.229> electronics<00:04:49.860> I'd<00:04:50.430> believe<00:04:50.760> that

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
much active electronics I'd believe that

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.330 
much active electronics I'd believe that
you<00:04:51.600> can<00:04:51.780> bridge<00:04:52.020> this<00:04:52.290> these<00:04:52.919> two<00:04:53.160> together

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
you can bridge this these two together

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.129 
you can bridge this these two together
to<00:04:53.669> get<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:54.210> equivalent<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.690> button<00:04:54.960> press

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
to get the equivalent of a button press

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.190 
to get the equivalent of a button press
and<00:04:55.590> there<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.820> various<00:04:57.210> functions<00:04:57.690> like<00:04:57.960> air

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
and there are various functions like air

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.110 
and there are various functions like air
volume<00:04:58.560> up<00:04:58.650> volume<00:04:58.680> down<00:04:59.010> so<00:04:59.250> on<00:04:59.610> involve

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
volume up volume down so on involve

volume up volume down so on involve
different<00:05:00.360> resistors<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:00.930> I'm<00:05:01.320> not<00:05:01.530> on<00:05:01.590> a

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
different resistors so I'm not on a

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.710 
different resistors so I'm not on a

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
percent sure if I can do this or not it

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.690 
percent sure if I can do this or not it
may<00:05:03.870> even<00:05:04.050> be<00:05:04.110> possible<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:05.040> resistor<00:05:05.580> in

lane to try and attenuate the volume or

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.100 
lane to try and attenuate the volume or
I<00:05:08.310> suppose<00:05:08.430> ultimately<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.570> tip<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:10.050> the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
I suppose ultimately the tip of the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.080 
I suppose ultimately the tip of the
microphone<00:05:10.500> itself<00:05:10.860> with<00:05:11.490> this<00:05:11.610> little<00:05:11.940> hole

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
microphone itself with this little hole

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.250 
microphone itself with this little hole
in<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.240> middle<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.600> then<00:05:12.720> there's<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:13.020> black

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
in the middle and then there's a black

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.140 
in the middle and then there's a black
mesh<00:05:13.500> covering<00:05:13.889> it<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.130> suppose<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:15.000> could

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
mesh covering it I suppose you could

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.610 
mesh covering it I suppose you could
just<00:05:15.180> put<00:05:15.510> something<00:05:15.840> over<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.289> try<00:05:16.500> and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
just put something over that to try and

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.870 
just put something over that to try and
attend<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.100> volume<00:05:17.400> I'm<00:05:17.550> not<00:05:17.729> really

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
attend you the volume I'm not really

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.760 
attend you the volume I'm not really
sure<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:18.360> it's<00:05:18.750> certainly<00:05:19.110> worth<00:05:19.289> so<00:05:19.500> good

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
sure but it's certainly worth so good

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.469 
sure but it's certainly worth so good
you<00:05:20.010> know<00:05:20.130> it's<00:05:20.430> worth<00:05:20.610> experimenting<00:05:21.000> with

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
you know it's worth experimenting with

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.570 
you know it's worth experimenting with
so<00:05:21.630> ordered<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.050> few<00:05:22.229> bits<00:05:22.530> for<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.830> but<00:05:23.460> I've

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
so ordered a few bits for that but I've

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.310 
so ordered a few bits for that but I've
just<00:05:23.729> ordered<00:05:23.880> them<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.180> do<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.570> him<00:05:24.690> they

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
just ordered them to do so him they

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.230 
just ordered them to do so him they
