00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
honestly it really wasn't that tough at

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.650 
honestly it really wasn't that tough at
all<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.230> do<00:03:38.410> have<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> go<00:03:38.770> through<00:03:39.660> some

all but you do have to go through some

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.310 
all but you do have to go through some
enemies<00:03:41.080> before<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.650> actually<00:03:41.890> get<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
enemies before you actually get to the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.160 
enemies before you actually get to the
spider<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:44.770> or<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.610> looks<00:03:45.820> like<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> spider<00:03:46.360> with
