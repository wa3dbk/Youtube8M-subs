don't<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.210> could<00:00:54.329> probably<00:00:54.539> use<00:00:54.870> any

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
don't know you could probably use any

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160

kind<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> tape<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
kind of tape for it but that's what I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.160 
kind of tape for it but that's what I
had<00:00:58.649> available<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> use<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.480> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
had available that's what I use so it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.700 
had available that's what I use so it
worked<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:01.969> then<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> used<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
worked pretty well then I used that

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.910 
worked pretty well then I used that
right<00:01:04.710> angle<00:01:04.890> picked<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
right angle picked there to just kind of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
right angle picked there to just kind of
set<00:01:08.159> everything<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.030> straighten<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> out

set everything in and straighten it out
and<00:01:10.200> make<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.320> tight<00:01:10.650> around<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.070> antenna

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and make it tight around the antenna

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
and make it tight around the antenna
that<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.729> already<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.920> d-link

that little white thing up in the top
corner<00:02:12.970> there<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.990> that's<00:02:14.590> what<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.800> wrap<00:02:15.070> my

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
corner there and that's what I wrap my

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.690 
corner there and that's what I wrap my
wire<00:02:15.580> around<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.830> improve<00:02:17.830> my<00:02:17.980> reception

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
wire around to improve my reception

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
wire around to improve my reception
I<00:02:20.220> used<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.340> pretty<00:02:21.850> thin<00:02:22.210> wire<00:02:23.880> removed<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
I used a pretty thin wire removed the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.670 
I used a pretty thin wire removed the
plastic<00:02:26.890> cover<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.820> expose<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.960> bare

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
plastic cover to expose the the bare

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.960 
plastic cover to expose the the bare
wire<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.460> and<00:02:32.310> exposed<00:02:33.310> quite<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> bit

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
wire there and exposed quite a bit

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.610 
wire there and exposed quite a bit
because<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.300> wanted<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.020> touch<00:02:35.230> all<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.500> way

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
because I wanted it to touch all the way

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.420 
because I wanted it to touch all the way
around<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.010> antenna<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:38.410> wrapped<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.340> around

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
around that antenna I wrapped it around

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.570 
around that antenna I wrapped it around
the<00:02:39.940> antenna<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.440> twisted<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.280> you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the antenna and then twisted it like you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.660 
the antenna and then twisted it like you
would<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.820> twist<00:02:43.240> tie<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:45.070> tried<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.430> tighten

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
would a twist tie and tried to tighten

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.910 
would a twist tie and tried to tighten
it<00:02:45.910> up<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.330> twist<00:02:46.870> too<00:02:47.110> tight<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.709> pre

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it up if you twist too tight it's pre

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.680 
it up if you twist too tight it's pre
thin<00:02:48.130> wire<00:02:48.370> you'll<00:02:48.700> break<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.090> wire<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.570> what

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
thin wire you'll break the wire so what

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.170 
thin wire you'll break the wire so what
I<00:02:49.750> did<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.440> used<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.880> writing<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:52.030> little

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
I did is I used that writing a little

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.030 
I did is I used that writing a little
pic<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:52.959> kind<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.350> pry<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.860> make<00:02:54.010> it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
pic to just kind of pry it and make it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.580 
pic to just kind of pry it and make it
tight<00:02:54.340> all<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.580> way<00:02:54.760> around<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.150> antenna

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.310 

after<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.650> twisted<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:01.570> wire<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.020> made<00:03:02.200> it

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
after I twisted the wire and made it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.630 
after I twisted the wire and made it
fairly<00:03:02.530> tight<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.280> went<00:03:03.520> ahead<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.940> wrapped

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
fairly tight I went ahead and wrapped

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.350 
fairly tight I went ahead and wrapped
the<00:03:06.640> wire<00:03:06.820> around<00:03:07.360> again<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:09.150> pushed<00:03:10.150> it

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
the wire around again and pushed it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.470 
the wire around again and pushed it
tight<00:03:11.290> around<00:03:11.680> there<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.360> everything<00:03:13.360> was

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
tight around there so everything was

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.210 
tight around there so everything was
kind<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.780> making<00:03:14.110> contact<00:03:14.320> now<00:03:14.800> it's<00:03:15.010> pretty

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
kind of making contact now it's pretty

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.750 
kind of making contact now it's pretty
snug<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.790> there<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:18.010> could<00:03:18.190> still<00:03:18.430> fall<00:03:18.730> off

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
snug in there it could still fall off

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.460 
snug in there it could still fall off
but<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:20.170> was<00:03:20.560> pretty<00:03:20.769> secure<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.549> way<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.440> I

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
but it was pretty secure this way but I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.910 
but it was pretty secure this way but I
went<00:03:23.799> ahead<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:25.239> was<00:03:25.660> gonna<00:03:25.810> hot<00:03:26.560> glue

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
went ahead and and I was gonna hot glue

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.970 
went ahead and and I was gonna hot glue
it<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> couldn't<00:03:28.930> find<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.500> hot<00:03:29.650> glue<00:03:29.950> gun

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
it but I couldn't find the hot glue gun

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.660 
it but I couldn't find the hot glue gun
so<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.430> decided<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.060> use<00:03:31.239> some<00:03:31.269> tape

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
so I decided to use some tape

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.789 
so I decided to use some tape
I<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:34.540> cut<00:03:34.780> about<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.080> quarter-inch<00:03:35.530> wide

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
I just cut about a quarter-inch wide

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.110 
I just cut about a quarter-inch wide
piece<00:03:36.280> of<00:03:36.489> tape<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:39.190> was<00:03:39.519> probably<00:03:39.730> about

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
piece of tape and I was probably about

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.680 
piece of tape and I was probably about
an<00:03:40.390> inch<00:03:40.660> long<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.820> put<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:42.910> on<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.180> top<00:03:43.420> to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
an inch long and put it on the top to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.090 
an inch long and put it on the top to
hold<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.230> then<00:03:44.350> worked<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.799> down<00:03:44.950> around

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
hold it and then worked it down around

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.590 
hold it and then worked it down around
there<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.670> was<00:03:45.760> pretty<00:03:45.970> tight<00:03:46.299> kept

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
there so it was pretty tight kept

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.820 
there so it was pretty tight kept
everything<00:03:46.930> real<00:03:47.140> tight<00:03:47.350> on<00:03:47.380> there<00:03:47.650> that

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
everything real tight on there that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.500 
everything real tight on there that
metal<00:03:48.160> tape<00:03:48.400> worked<00:03:48.670> pretty<00:03:48.850> well<00:03:49.350> because<00:03:50.350> it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
metal tape worked pretty well because it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.759 
metal tape worked pretty well because it
it<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:52.690> brought<00:03:52.870> everything<00:03:53.019> together<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
it just brought everything together and

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.530 
it just brought everything together and
I<00:03:53.860> think<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.250> made<00:03:54.610> everything<00:03:54.940> come<00:03:55.299> into

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
I think it made everything come into

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.470 
I think it made everything come into
contact<00:03:55.780> pretty<00:03:56.320> well<00:03:56.940> gave<00:03:57.940> me<00:03:58.030> pretty<00:03:58.239> good

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
contact pretty well gave me pretty good

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.020 
contact pretty well gave me pretty good
reception<00:03:58.780> in<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.230> end<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:03.310> last<00:04:03.610> slide

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
reception in the end the last slide

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.229 
reception in the end the last slide
shows<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:06.150> finished<00:04:07.150> product<00:04:08.400> after<00:04:09.400> I

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
shows the finished product after I

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.210 
shows the finished product after I
got<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.049> all<00:04:12.170> done<00:04:12.349> like<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.799> I<00:04:12.860> went<00:04:13.099> up

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
got it all done like that I went up

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.900 
got it all done like that I went up
tested<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.879> and<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:15.110> had<00:04:15.379> it<00:04:15.409> probably<00:04:15.920> about<00:04:16.370> 40

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
tested it and I had it probably about 40

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.310 
tested it and I had it probably about 40
feet<00:04:17.090> from<00:04:17.150> my<00:04:17.570> router<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.419> hardly<00:04:21.079> ever

feet from my router and I hardly ever

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.409 
feet from my router and I hardly ever
got<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.680> signal<00:04:22.220> very<00:04:22.520> rarely<00:04:22.910> would<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.300> ever

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
got a signal very rarely would it ever

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.120 
got a signal very rarely would it ever
connect<00:04:23.900> wouldn't<00:04:24.680> show<00:04:24.860> me<00:04:25.039> video<00:04:26.979> for<00:04:27.979> more

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130
