with<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.879> guys<00:03:03.909> because<00:03:04.359> we've<00:03:04.989> really<00:03:05.230> had<00:03:05.379> a

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
with you guys because we've really had a

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.399 
with you guys because we've really had a
blast<00:03:05.650> building<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.480> when<00:03:07.659> we<00:03:07.780> decided<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
blast building it so when we decided to

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.339 
blast building it so when we decided to
build<00:03:08.620> our<00:03:08.829> minis<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.719> needed<00:03:10.719> to<00:03:10.810> put<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.049> lot

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
build our minis we needed to put a lot

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.830 
build our minis we needed to put a lot
of<00:03:11.379> detail<00:03:11.889> into<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.489> relatively<00:03:13.030> small<00:03:13.480> amount

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
of detail into a relatively small amount

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.640 
of detail into a relatively small amount
of<00:03:13.930> space<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:15.549> we<00:03:15.579> had<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:15.909> come<00:03:16.060> up<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.359> new

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
of space so we had to come up with a new

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.289 
of space so we had to come up with a new
process<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.859> order<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.189> do<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:19.000> it's

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
process in order to do that and it's

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.470 
process in order to do that and it's
Kevin<00:03:19.659> said<00:03:19.870> we<00:03:20.139> used<00:03:20.439> the<00:03:21.220> 3d<00:03:21.700> printing<00:03:22.269> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
Kevin said we used the 3d printing and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.770 
Kevin said we used the 3d printing and
3d<00:03:23.139> scanning<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:23.950> order<00:03:24.219> to<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.629> we

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
3d scanning in order to do that so we

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.539 
3d scanning in order to do that so we
build<00:03:26.049> large<00:03:26.379> models<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.849> play<00:03:28.180> then<00:03:29.549> scan

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
build large models out of play then scan

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.300 
build large models out of play then scan
them<00:03:30.819> with<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.419> 3d<00:03:31.719> scanner<00:03:32.169> put<00:03:33.010> them<00:03:33.099> in<00:03:33.219> the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
them with the 3d scanner put them in the

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.209 
them with the 3d scanner put them in the
computer<00:03:33.909> and<00:03:34.169> enhance<00:03:35.169> them<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.859> manipulate

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:36.219 
computer and enhance them and manipulate

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.599 
computer and enhance them and manipulate
them<00:03:36.909> in<00:03:37.030> ways<00:03:37.239> we<00:03:37.599> never<00:03:37.629> could<00:03:38.139> before<00:03:38.609> then

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
them in ways we never could before then

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.569 
them in ways we never could before then
we<00:03:39.730> shrink<00:03:40.030> them<00:03:40.209> down<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:41.370> print<00:03:42.370> them<00:03:42.489> out

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
we shrink them down and print them out

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.750 
we shrink them down and print them out
and<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.989> gives<00:03:44.229> us<00:03:44.500> an<00:03:44.799> incredible<00:03:45.400> level<00:03:45.519> of

and that gives us an incredible level of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.569 
and that gives us an incredible level of
detail<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:47.079> what's<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.409> the<00:03:47.470> box<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:48.220> should<00:03:48.549> be
