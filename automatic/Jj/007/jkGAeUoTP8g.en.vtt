people's the actual shape of their bones
is<00:01:21.689> such<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.409> bend<00:01:22.650> into<00:01:22.920> these

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
is such they can bend into these

is such they can bend into these
impossible<00:01:23.460> shapes<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.869> possibility

impossible shapes the other possibility

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
impossible shapes the other possibility
is<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> ligaments<00:01:27.299> the

the<00:01:46.940> day<00:01:47.120> we<00:01:47.300> went<00:01:47.420> into<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.780> MRI<00:01:48.080> scan<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.470> was

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
the day we went into the MRI scan I was

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.500 
the day we went into the MRI scan I was
really<00:01:48.800> interested<00:01:49.340> actually<00:01:49.430> because<00:01:50.030> I've

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
really interested actually because I've

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.710 
really interested actually because I've
never<00:01:50.720> really<00:01:51.140> looked<00:01:52.130> at<00:01:52.430> my<00:01:53.150> body<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.660> a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
never really looked at my body in a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.180 
never really looked at my body in a
technical<00:01:54.110> way<00:01:54.230> other<00:01:54.410> than<00:01:54.530> purely

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
technical way other than purely

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.590 
technical way other than purely
performing<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.090> was<00:01:56.180> really<00:01:56.420> interesting

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
performing so it was really interesting

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.620 
performing so it was really interesting
just<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.080> see<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.470> how<00:01:57.680> how<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.520> works<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.450> also

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
first of all I went in and I saw leant
back<00:02:05.810> as<00:02:06.290> far<00:02:06.470> as<00:02:06.650> I<00:02:06.710> possibly<00:02:07.130> could<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:08.740> this

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
back as far as I possibly could and this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.960 
back as far as I possibly could and this
is<00:02:09.890> me

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
is me

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.890 
is me
and<00:02:11.230> when<00:02:12.230> Delia<00:02:12.590> did<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.830> same<00:02:13.040> thing<00:02:13.900> you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and when Delia did the same thing you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.560 
and when Delia did the same thing you
get<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.410> far<00:02:15.890> more<00:02:16.100> dramatic<00:02:16.400> picture<00:02:17.150> when<00:02:17.480> we

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
get a far more dramatic picture when we

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.540 
get a far more dramatic picture when we
looked<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.990> scans<00:02:18.380> we<00:02:18.890> could<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.160> all<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
looked at the scans we could see all the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.610 
looked at the scans we could see all the
action<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.390> ligaments<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.290> soft

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
action was in the ligaments the soft

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.190 
action was in the ligaments the soft
tissue<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.160> holds<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.880> bones<00:02:23.060> together<00:02:23.420> so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
tissue that holds the bones together so

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.480 
tissue that holds the bones together so
there's<00:02:24.320> nothing<00:02:24.500> special<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:25.190> her

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
there's nothing special about her

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.460 
there's nothing special about her
skeleton<00:02:26.060> it's<00:02:26.450> all<00:02:26.720> about<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.140> way<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.320> which

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
skeleton it's all about the way in which

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.860 
skeleton it's all about the way in which
her<00:02:27.590> bones<00:02:27.830> are<00:02:28.040> connected<00:02:28.330> for<00:02:29.330> genetic

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
her bones are connected for genetic

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.080 
her bones are connected for genetic
reasons<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.530> she's<00:02:31.010> got<00:02:31.220> far<00:02:31.490> more<00:02:31.520> stretchy

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
reasons as she's got far more stretchy

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.240 
reasons as she's got far more stretchy
ligaments<00:02:32.720> than<00:02:32.870> most<00:02:33.110> people<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.130> she's

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
ligaments than most people but she's

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.880 
ligaments than most people but she's
also<00:02:34.490> trained<00:02:35.060> really<00:02:35.510> hard<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.500> from<00:02:36.800> about

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
also trained really hard so from about

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 
also trained really hard so from about
the<00:02:37.040> age<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.370> 8<00:02:37.670> she's<00:02:38.150> been<00:02:38.300> bending<00:02:38.600> into

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
the age of 8 she's been bending into

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.600 
the age of 8 she's been bending into
these<00:02:39.050> impossible<00:02:39.410> shapes<00:02:39.800> pulling<00:02:40.490> those

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
these impossible shapes pulling those

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
these impossible shapes pulling those
ligaments<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.420> make<00:02:41.570> them<00:02:41.690> as<00:02:41.780> flexible<00:02:42.320> as

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
ligaments to make them as flexible as

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.830 
ligaments to make them as flexible as
possible<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> reason<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> contortionist

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
possible so the reason the contortionist

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.870 
possible so the reason the contortionist
can<00:02:44.990> perform<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.380> impossible<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:46.070> all<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.730> do

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
can perform the impossible is all to do

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.460 
can perform the impossible is all to do
with<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.300> ligaments<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.990> soft<00:02:48.260> tissue

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
with the ligaments the soft tissue

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.080 
with the ligaments the soft tissue
holding<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.950> bones<00:02:49.130> together<00:02:49.370> their

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
holding the bones together their

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.000 
holding the bones together their
skeletons<00:02:50.690> are<00:02:50.810> absolutely<00:02:51.110> identical<00:02:51.200> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
skeletons are absolutely identical to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.979 
skeletons are absolutely identical to
your<00:02:52.190> skeleton<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.120> my<00:02:53.269> skeleton<00:02:53.810> I

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
your skeleton and to my skeleton I

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.259 
your skeleton and to my skeleton I
thought<00:02:54.709> it'd<00:02:54.800> be<00:02:54.830> kind<00:02:55.070> of<00:02:55.130> fun<00:02:55.340> for<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:56.120> to

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
thought it'd be kind of fun for you to

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.070 
thought it'd be kind of fun for you to
assess<00:02:56.570> how<00:02:56.780> bendy<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.440> are<00:02:57.620> before<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.070> see

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
assess how bendy you are before you see

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.210 
assess how bendy you are before you see
and<00:03:00.080> what<00:03:00.350> we<00:03:00.440> got<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> do<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.010> with<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and what we got to do that is with the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.140 
and what we got to do that is with the
standard<00:03:01.580> bendiness<00:03:02.090> scale<00:03:03.100> so<00:03:04.100> what<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.000> do

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
standard bendiness scale so what you do

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.820 
standard bendiness scale so what you do
and<00:03:05.360> I'm<00:03:05.420> not<00:03:05.540> gonna<00:03:05.630> ask<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.140> dress<00:03:06.650> up

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
and I'm not gonna ask you to dress up

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.790 
and I'm not gonna ask you to dress up
like<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.070> but<00:03:08.170> basically<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.320> don't<00:03:09.680> need

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
like this but basically you don't need

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.990 
like this but basically you don't need
to<00:03:09.890> do<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.519> just<00:03:10.670> don't<00:03:10.790> give

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
to do this but you just don't give

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.360 
to do this but you just don't give
yourself<00:03:11.390> at<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.930> point<00:03:12.170> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.920> do<00:03:13.160> this

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
yourself at one point if you can do this

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.830 
yourself at one point if you can do this
if<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.760> could<00:03:13.910> place<00:03:14.090> your<00:03:14.239> hands<00:03:14.510> flat<00:03:14.690> on

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
if you could place your hands flat on

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.180 
if you could place your hands flat on
the<00:03:14.900> floor<00:03:15.110> without<00:03:15.200> bending<00:03:15.530> your<00:03:15.709> knees<00:03:15.950> so

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
the floor without bending your knees so

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.009 
the floor without bending your knees so
that<00:03:16.220> don't<00:03:16.489> do<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.790> but<00:03:17.570> you'll<00:03:17.720> know<00:03:17.870> whether

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
that don't do it but you'll know whether

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.100 
that don't do it but you'll know whether
you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.459> can<00:03:19.489> try<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.900> just

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
you can then you can try this you just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.080 
you can then you can try this you just
hold<00:03:21.860> your<00:03:21.950> hand<00:03:22.220> out<00:03:22.400> or<00:03:22.640> sorry<00:03:22.790> hold<00:03:22.970> your

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
hold your hand out or sorry hold your

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
hold your hand out or sorry hold your
arm<00:03:23.209> out<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.570> see<00:03:24.230> whether<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.530> elbow<00:03:25.070> will

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
arm out and see whether the elbow will

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.970 
arm out and see whether the elbow will
Bend<00:03:25.400> backwards<00:03:26.239> okay<00:03:26.989> backwards<00:03:27.560> Bend<00:03:27.800> you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
Bend backwards okay backwards Bend you

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.729 
Bend backwards okay backwards Bend you
give<00:03:28.100> yourself<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.459> point<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:29.239> each<00:03:29.450> arm<00:03:29.739> we'll

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
give yourself a point on each arm we'll

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.130 
give yourself a point on each arm we'll
move<00:03:30.920> on<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> next<00:03:31.459> part<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.850> test<00:03:32.140> one

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
move on to the next part of the test one

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.960 
move on to the next part of the test one
point<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:33.709> each<00:03:33.799> need<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.610> will<00:03:34.730> bend

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
point for each need that will bend

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.050 
point for each need that will bend
backwards<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:35.870> carefully<00:03:36.350> straighten<00:03:37.310> legs

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
backwards so carefully straighten legs

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.650 
backwards so carefully straighten legs
and<00:03:38.810> again<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.110> probably<00:03:39.290> know<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.540> the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
and again you probably know this is the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.410 
and again you probably know this is the
fun<00:03:41.870> one<00:03:41.900> okay<00:03:42.890> don't<00:03:43.310> hurt<00:03:43.700> yourself

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
fun one okay don't hurt yourself

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.570 
fun one okay don't hurt yourself
a<00:03:44.450> pain<00:03:44.840> or<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.500> person<00:03:45.830> next<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.250> it's

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
a pain or the person next to you it's

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.640 
a pain or the person next to you it's
whether<00:03:46.820> your<00:03:47.030> thumb<00:03:47.360> can<00:03:47.660> go<00:03:47.780> back<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.380> touch

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
whether your thumb can go back and touch

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.340 
whether your thumb can go back and touch
the<00:03:49.040> forearm<00:03:49.489> another<00:03:50.360> two<00:03:50.570> points<00:03:50.989> one<00:03:51.170> for

each hand for that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.960 
each hand for that
and<00:03:53.380> finally<00:03:54.380> one<00:03:54.950> point<00:03:55.280> if<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.640> can<00:03:55.760> bend

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
and finally one point if you can bend

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.830 
and finally one point if you can bend
your<00:03:56.060> little<00:03:56.420> finger<00:03:56.780> back<00:03:56.960> past<00:03:57.470> 90<00:03:58.010> degrees

your little finger back past 90 degrees
without<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.230> snapping<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:05.060> you'll<00:04:05.150> end<00:04:05.330> up

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
without it snapping so so you'll end up

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.200 
without it snapping so so you'll end up
with<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.660> score<00:04:06.490> you'll<00:04:07.490> end<00:04:07.610> up<00:04:07.700> with<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.880> score

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
but not fully there seven is again you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.490 
but not fully there seven is again you
know<00:04:26.420> creeping<00:04:26.810> up<00:04:26.930> there<00:04:27.110> but<00:04:27.290> for<00:04:27.410> high

know creeping up there but for high

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.630 
know creeping up there but for high
permeability<00:04:27.650> you're<00:04:28.160> talking<00:04:28.400> about<00:04:28.520> eight

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
permeability you're talking about eight

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.610 
permeability you're talking about eight
to<00:04:28.790> nine<00:04:28.820> on<00:04:29.270> almost<00:04:29.480> every<00:04:29.930> contortionist

to nine on almost every contortionist

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.770 
to nine on almost every contortionist
scores<00:04:30.920> eight<00:04:31.220> or<00:04:31.430> nine<00:04:31.580> on<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.150> this<00:04:32.450> scale

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
scores eight or nine on this this scale

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.870 
scores eight or nine on this this scale
so<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.470> now<00:04:33.770> know<00:04:33.800> whether<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.640> have<00:04:34.850> a

you're up an eight to nine it's just

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.420 
you're up an eight to nine it's just
that<00:04:39.140> you're<00:04:39.230> not<00:04:39.380> practicing<00:04:39.590> that's<00:04:40.130> all<00:04:40.310> it

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
doing the extreme backbend and that

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.310 
doing the extreme backbend and that
there's<00:05:05.210> very<00:05:05.360> recent<00:05:05.660> findings<00:05:05.990> out<00:05:06.080> aware

terms of health so yes there the studies

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.280 
terms of health so yes there the studies
show<00:05:19.640> that<00:05:19.669> she<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.450> a<00:05:20.570> good<00:05:20.750> thing<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.200> be
