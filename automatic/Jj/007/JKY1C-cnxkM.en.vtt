00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
heavy metals and it also removes ammonia

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.870

because a lot of these water

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.170 
because a lot of these water

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
remove the chlorine they usually convert

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.800 
remove the chlorine they usually convert
it<00:03:13.040> into<00:03:13.130> ammonia<00:03:13.459> into<00:03:14.060> ammonia<00:03:14.570> so

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
goldfish you get goldfish flakes and

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.400 
goldfish you get goldfish flakes and
also<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.459> good<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:53.940> doing<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.080> fish<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
also it's good for doing the fish the

cycle which I'll do in another video and

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.119 
cycle which I'll do in another video and
a<00:03:59.010> number<00:03:59.190> 12<00:03:59.610> would<00:03:59.910> be<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:01.049> obvious<00:04:01.260> gravel
