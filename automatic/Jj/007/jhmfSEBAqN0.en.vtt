00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
everything underneath the wheel arches

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
everything underneath the wheel arches
so<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> bottom<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> car<00:01:20.790> up

let's go so I've got the bottom wheel

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
let's go so I've got the bottom wheel
arches<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
arches there I'm going to go around the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
arches there I'm going to go around the
wheel<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.250> we're<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> go

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
wheel and now we're going to go

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.080 
wheel and now we're going to go
underneath<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.899> car<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.759> front

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
wheel arch and again because we're doing

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.789 
wheel arch and again because we're doing
it<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.100> black<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.200> very

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it on black you don't have to be very

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.060 
it on black you don't have to be very
precise<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.079> list<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.710> picture

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
precise if you if you list this picture

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.090 
precise if you if you list this picture
that<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.969> modifying<00:01:57.479> had<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.619> more<00:01:58.799> light

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that I was modifying had some more light

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.470 
that I was modifying had some more light
in<00:01:59.340> between<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> tire<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
in between the tire and

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.300 
in between the tire and
the<00:02:01.600> top<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.020> wheel<00:02:02.230> well<00:02:02.470> then<00:02:02.740> we'd

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
the top of the wheel well then we'd

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.920 
the top of the wheel well then we'd
obviously<00:02:03.460> want<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.180> be<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.360> little<00:02:04.630> bit<00:02:04.750> more

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
obviously want to be a little bit more

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.350 
obviously want to be a little bit more
precise<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.430> now<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.610> went<00:02:06.970> around<00:02:07.210> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
precise so so now I went around the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.420 
precise so so now I went around the
picture<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.050> selected<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.620> whole<00:02:08.830> thing<00:02:09.160> and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
picture and selected the whole thing and

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.540 
picture and selected the whole thing and
so<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.940> went<00:02:10.270> up<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.570> selected<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.550> Select

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
so I went up and selected the Select

so I went up and selected the Select
cursor<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> now<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.380> do<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:14.770> can

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
cursor and now what we can do is we can

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.370 
cursor and now what we can do is we can
just<00:02:15.160> drag<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.790> top<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.270> photo<00:02:16.480> down<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
just drag the top of the photo down and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.710 
just drag the top of the photo down and
then<00:02:18.570> save<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.600> there<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.420> roughly<00:02:22.420> we

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
then save it there and so roughly we

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.380 
then save it there and so roughly we
have<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> rough<00:02:23.470> sketch<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.300> basically<00:02:25.300> a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
have a rough sketch of basically a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.870 
have a rough sketch of basically a
lowered<00:02:25.810> car<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.340> crop<00:02:27.610> this

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
lowered car and then we can crop this

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.170 
lowered car and then we can crop this
photo<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.230> remove<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.040> white<00:02:30.220> at

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
photo just to remove the the white at

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.260 
photo just to remove the the white at
the<00:02:31.210> top<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.470> know<00:02:32.740> crop<00:02:33.270> and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
the top of it so you know crop and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.930 
the top of it so you know crop and
that's<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.100> see<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.550> front<00:02:36.790> wheel

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
that's it so you can see the front wheel

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.580 
that's it so you can see the front wheel
I<00:02:37.060> kind<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.270> messed<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.780> little<00:02:38.020> bit<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
I kind of messed up a little bit in the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.290 
I kind of messed up a little bit in the
corner<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.550> all<00:02:39.700> good<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.060> we're

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
corner but it's all good because we're

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.700 
corner but it's all good because we're
going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.480> put<00:02:40.660> some<00:02:40.690> other<00:02:40.930> wheels<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.380> so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
going to put some other wheels on it so

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.210 
going to put some other wheels on it so
here<00:02:42.670> are<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.420> here's<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.140> wheel<00:02:44.530> picture<00:02:44.980> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
here are is here's the wheel picture so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.160 
here are is here's the wheel picture so
we're<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.550> do<00:02:45.790> we're<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> try<00:02:47.110> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
we're going to do we're going to try the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.310 
we're going to do we're going to try the
magnetic<00:02:47.890> lasso<00:02:48.250> tool<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.050> way<00:02:50.140> this

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
magnetic lasso tool and the way this

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.730 
magnetic lasso tool and the way this
Tool<00:02:50.560> Works<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.220> basically<00:02:51.550> just<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:53.380> works

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
Tool Works is it basically just it works

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.460 
Tool Works is it basically just it works
well<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.100> high<00:02:54.340> contrast<00:02:54.700> areas<00:02:55.270> so<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.380> know

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
well in high contrast areas so you know

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.230 
well in high contrast areas so you know
where<00:02:56.710> you<00:02:57.040> have<00:02:57.130> something<00:02:57.460> that's<00:02:57.490> white<00:02:57.940> or

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
where you have something that's white or

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.810 
where you have something that's white or
white<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:58.960> black<00:02:59.260> or<00:02:59.590> silver<00:02:59.860> on<00:03:00.160> black<00:03:00.190> such

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
white on black or silver on black such

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.770 
white on black or silver on black such
as<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.270> picture<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:03.310> basically<00:03:03.460> just

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
as in this picture and it basically just

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.390 
as in this picture and it basically just
makes<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.900> little<00:03:05.110> bit<00:03:05.230> easier<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.709> select<00:03:06.070> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
makes a little bit easier to select the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.530 
makes a little bit easier to select the
area<00:03:06.580> you're<00:03:06.910> trying<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:08.380> cut<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.540> we're

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
area you're trying to to cut so we're

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.620 
area you're trying to to cut so we're
going<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:11.700> finish<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.330> there<00:03:16.540> we

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
going to finish that all right there we

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.650 
going to finish that all right there we
go<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:16.870> got<00:03:16.989> selected<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:19.420> we're<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.600> to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
go we got selected then we're going to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.979 
go we got selected then we're going to
copy<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.520> control<00:03:21.520> C<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.209> then<00:03:22.300> ctrl<00:03:22.780> V<00:03:23.110> into

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
copy that control C and then ctrl V into

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.600 
copy that control C and then ctrl V into
the<00:03:25.989> other<00:03:26.140> pictures<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.130> now<00:03:27.280> we're<00:03:27.430> going<00:03:27.550> to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
the other pictures so now we're going to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.290 
the other pictures so now we're going to
make<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.880> smaller<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.860> if<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.820> just<00:03:31.030> put<00:03:31.209> it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
make it smaller and so if I just put it

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.479 
make it smaller and so if I just put it
up<00:03:31.390> there<00:03:31.450> doesn't<00:03:31.989> really<00:03:32.140> look<00:03:32.680> correct<00:03:33.160> so

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
up there doesn't really look correct so

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.220 
up there doesn't really look correct so
what<00:03:33.730> I'm<00:03:33.820> going<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:33.970> do<00:03:34.120> here<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.480> rotate<00:03:35.050> it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
what I'm going to do here is rotate it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.350 
what I'm going to do here is rotate it
and<00:03:35.380> then<00:03:36.310> make<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.730> little<00:03:36.850> bit<00:03:37.000> smaller

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
and then make it a little bit smaller

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.100 
and then make it a little bit smaller
and<00:03:37.800> then<00:03:38.800> put<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.190> up<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.640> then<00:03:40.180> let's<00:03:40.750> see<00:03:40.989> if

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
and then put it up and then let's see if

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.790 
and then put it up and then let's see if
we<00:03:41.230> apply<00:03:42.300> see<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.390> looks<00:03:43.570> looks<00:03:44.200> alright<00:03:44.620> we

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
we apply see it looks looks alright we

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.340 
we apply see it looks looks alright we
might<00:03:45.010> want<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.310> make<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:46.750> bit<00:03:47.020> wider

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
might want to make it a little bit wider

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.350 
might want to make it a little bit wider
in<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.770> back<00:03:47.950> there's<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.370> white<00:03:48.670> spot<00:03:49.060> but

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
in the back there's that white spot but

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.040 
in the back there's that white spot but
we<00:03:49.450> can<00:03:49.600> we<00:03:49.959> can<00:03:50.110> always<00:03:50.550> go<00:03:51.550> back<00:03:52.300> in<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.840> just

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
we can we can always go back in and just

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.110 
we can we can always go back in and just
fill<00:03:53.500> in<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:54.160> white<00:03:54.340> spot<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
fill in that that white spot in the

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.010 
fill in that that white spot in the
front<00:03:55.270> wheel<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.560> i'll<00:03:56.620> apply<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.280> then

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
front wheel so i'll apply it and then

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.540 
front wheel so i'll apply it and then
we're<00:03:59.020> going<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.170> go<00:03:59.260> over<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.830> duplicate<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
we're going to go over and duplicate the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.060 
we're going to go over and duplicate the
layer<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:02.230> we're<00:04:02.350> just<00:04:02.380> going<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.650> make<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.830> copy

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
layer so we're just going to make a copy

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.190 
layer so we're just going to make a copy
of<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.340> first<00:04:03.580> layer<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.239> then<00:04:04.540> drag<00:04:04.959> that

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
of the first layer and then drag that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.740 
of the first layer and then drag that
wheel<00:04:05.410> over<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.070> rear<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.520> then<00:04:07.330> make<00:04:07.570> it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
wheel over to the rear and then make it

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.589 
wheel over to the rear and then make it
larger

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.680 

see<00:04:14.599> here<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:14.959> rotate<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.650> little<00:04:15.980> bit

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
see here and rotate that a little bit

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.629 
see here and rotate that a little bit
because<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.989> wheel<00:04:18.139> is<00:04:18.320> closer<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:18.950> it

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
because the wheel is closer to you it

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.280 
because the wheel is closer to you it
does<00:04:19.880> doesn't<00:04:20.239> need<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.810> be<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.959> little<00:04:21.019> bit

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
does doesn't need to be a little bit

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.580 
does doesn't need to be a little bit
bigger<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:23.450> let's<00:04:23.660> see<00:04:23.840> let's<00:04:24.169> see<00:04:24.260> how<00:04:24.410> that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
bigger so let's see let's see how that

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.390 
bigger so let's see let's see how that
looks<00:04:25.720> looks<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.500> looks<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.770> little<00:04:27.919> bit<00:04:28.190> in

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
looks looks so it looks a little bit in

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:38.440 
looks looks so it looks a little bit in
so<00:04:29.210> we<00:04:29.360> want<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:30.040> skew<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.190> little<00:04:31.370> bit<00:04:37.450> see

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
so we want to skew it a little bit see

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.440 
so we want to skew it a little bit see
if<00:04:38.480> we<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.780> rotate<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.940> make<00:04:40.940> it<00:04:41.090> look<00:04:41.270> a

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
if we can rotate it make it look a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.050 
if we can rotate it make it look a
little<00:04:41.630> bit<00:04:41.840> more<00:04:42.080> realistic<00:04:45.820> see<00:04:46.820> how<00:04:46.910> that

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
little bit more realistic see how that

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.629 
little bit more realistic see how that
looks<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:51.080> basically<00:04:51.919> it's<00:04:52.070> a<00:04:52.130> rough<00:04:52.340> sketch

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
looks so basically it's a rough sketch

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.430 
looks so basically it's a rough sketch
you<00:04:52.760> can<00:04:52.880> see<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.030> back<00:04:53.419> wheels<00:04:53.690> not<00:04:53.930> perfect

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
you can see that back wheels not perfect

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.530 
you can see that back wheels not perfect
but<00:04:54.620> you<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.979> fiddle<00:04:55.700> around<00:04:55.880> with<00:04:56.150> it<00:04:56.360> just

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
but you can fiddle around with it just

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.420 
but you can fiddle around with it just
to<00:04:56.660> get<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.320> look<00:04:57.500> right<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.040> let's<00:04:58.280> see<00:04:58.400> if

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
to get it to look right and let's see if

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.180 
to get it to look right and let's see if
we<00:04:58.610> could<00:04:58.760> see<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.419> before<00:04:59.840> and<00:04:59.990> after<00:05:00.290> so

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
we could see like before and after so

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.550 
we could see like before and after so
there's<00:05:01.580> stock<00:05:01.970> wheels<00:05:02.270> then<00:05:02.690> we<00:05:03.260> add<00:05:03.380> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
there's stock wheels then we add the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.830 
there's stock wheels then we add the
front<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.010> rear<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:04.550> pretty<00:05:05.330> good<00:05:05.570> you

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
front in the rear so pretty good you

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.909 
front in the rear so pretty good you
know<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.110> you're<00:05:06.229> shopping<00:05:06.500> around<00:05:06.680> for

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
know if you're shopping around for

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.680 
know if you're shopping around for
wheels<00:05:07.280> or<00:05:07.490> something<00:05:07.520> cool<00:05:08.120> thing<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.389> do<00:05:08.660> you

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
wheels or something cool thing to do you

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.379 
wheels or something cool thing to do you
can<00:05:08.960> just<00:05:09.139> go<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.040> and<00:05:10.310> modify<00:05:10.700> things<00:05:11.000> and

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
can just go in and modify things and

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.990 
can just go in and modify things and

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
just get a sense for for what wheels

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.510 
just get a sense for for what wheels
look<00:05:14.330> like<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:15.440> also<00:05:15.560> if<00:05:15.800> you're<00:05:15.919> posting<00:05:16.400> up
