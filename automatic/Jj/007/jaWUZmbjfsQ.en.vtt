00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.870
 it is true that the problems 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.580
 emotional and psychological even a 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.450
 extreme mental distress can 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.499
 affect closely what each of us 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:21.590
 but does that mean that we are 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:23.810
 all crazy what is the source a 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.190
 mental distress 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.689
 the psychiatrists of yesteryear think she 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.279
 stemmed from an imbalance of moods 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 that we could only heal 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.150
 bleeding with 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.470
 knives or other leeches 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.239
 psychiatrist think that the problems 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.579
 mental organs such as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.580
 tonsils the stomach or spleen and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.769
 take off later they tried to 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.090
 change the function of the brain but these 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.519
 efforts failed, as did the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.809
 previous nowadays psychiatrists 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.430
 states that the resolution of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.080
 undesirable behavior is at 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.699
 way of pills that establish a 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 balance or chemical in the brain 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:12.090
 are they right this time despite this 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.619
 number of proofs 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.880
 psychiatrists will tell you that the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.049
 psychotropic drugs are the equivalent of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.659
 drugs used in medicine 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.659
 traditional eating 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.710
 the answer is that unlike a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.600
 substance like insulin that corrects 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.260
 a measurable deficiency experienced in 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.570
 the body 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.760
 psychotropic possible no 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.760
 Visible and measurable physical abnormality 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.409
 here is evidence of an infection 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.490
 bacterial 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.899
 here is the psychiatric disorder of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.990
 deficit of attention and 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.990
 hyperactivity 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.020
 here is a broken arm 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.690
 here is a major depressive disorder here 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.920
 a brain tumor 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.050
 here is a bipolar disorder we open 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.429
 so the question how to prescribe 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.980
 drugs for something that is 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.830
 not here 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.120
 answer it's impossible more like 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.710
 psychotropic drugs are designed to 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.720
 to cross the natural defenses of the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.250
 body has arrived up to the brain they 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.590
 can upset processes very 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.160
 tricky that the brain needs for 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.160
 working properly 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.530
 that's what creates the side effects 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.530
 which can be serious 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.540
 despite the morbid effects of these 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.070
 Psychotropic psychiatrists and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.290
 Pharmaceutical companies use 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.590
 to create a huge market through which 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.000
 in their pocket billions of dollars 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.590
 they arrived there by qualifying the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 daily problems of troubles 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.660
 which required treatment 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.640
 psychiatric 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.000
 shyness for example becomes the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.810
 anxiety disorders social loss 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.730
 of a close major depressive disorder the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.330
 nostalgia anxiety disorders of 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.030
 separation suspicion disorders of the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.690
 paranoid personality of the ups and downs 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.100
 low bipolar disorder tend to be 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.870
 airhead thada is why he 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.460
 is almost impossible for someone to 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.290
 go to a psychiatrist and who do not 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.110
 do not stand out labeled a disease 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.970
 mental and which says diagnosis of a 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.970
 mental illness that psychotropic 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.220
 and these medications are thought to cause 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.810
 more than 700000 serious reactions each 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.730
 year and 42 thousand deaths while 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.020
 the psychiatric industry is garnering a 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.680
 third of trillions of dollars 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.680
 annually 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.169
 the question is not whether the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.380
 emotional problems people are 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.720
 real they are but here are the real ones 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.070
 questions to ask themselves how do 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.419
 psychiatrists have they managed to convince 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.230
 the people that these problems were 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.550
 symptoms of a mental illness 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.960
 how did they use these diseases 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.700
 to create a demand for these 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.680
 psychotropic drugs among doctors and the 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.180
 General public 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.040
 and how are these drugs that have no 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.230
 therapeutic virtue and which entails 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.490
 many harmful side effects are 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.169
 they became the standard treatment 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.169
 for all daily difficulties
