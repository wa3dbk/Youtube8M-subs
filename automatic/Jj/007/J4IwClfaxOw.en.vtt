the aquarium so the way the white spot
works<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.390> when<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.349> fish<00:03:15.500> becomes<00:03:15.980> stressed

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
works is when the fish becomes stressed

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.699 
works is when the fish becomes stressed
the<00:03:16.940> immune<00:03:17.209> system<00:03:17.629> of<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.780> fish<00:03:18.110> goes<00:03:18.349> down

the immune system of the fish goes down

the immune system of the fish goes down
the<00:03:19.430> white<00:03:19.640> spot<00:03:19.970> will<00:03:20.150> actually<00:03:20.599> grow<00:03:21.110> on<00:03:21.349> the

quite likely to track the disease as
well<00:05:15.890> so<00:05:16.730> one<00:05:16.940> spot<00:05:17.210> is<00:05:17.330> quite<00:05:17.690> common<00:05:18.140> the<00:05:18.590> key

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
well so one spot is quite common the key

well so one spot is quite common the key
is<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.220> be<00:05:19.340> able<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.640> identify<00:05:20.420> if<00:05:20.750> they<00:05:20.930> do<00:05:20.990> get
