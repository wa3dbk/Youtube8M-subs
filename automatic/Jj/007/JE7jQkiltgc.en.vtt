already know that in the new mw3 they're
going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> be<00:00:11.969> using<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> old<00:00:12.570> mw2<00:00:13.610> engine

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
going to be using the old mw2 engine

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.440 
going to be using the old mw2 engine
which<00:00:14.790> means<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.420> very

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
which means it's going to be very

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.769 
which means it's going to be very
similar<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.230> mw2<00:00:16.710> or<00:00:17.550> exactly<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> same<00:00:18.750> but

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
similar to mw2 or exactly the same but

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.679 
similar to mw2 or exactly the same but
with<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.260> maps<00:00:19.500> new<00:00:19.830> weapons<00:00:20.220> etc<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.150> maybe

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
with new maps new weapons etc and maybe

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.060 
with new maps new weapons etc and maybe
a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.140> glitter<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.590> top<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
a little bit of glitter on top of that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.609 
a little bit of glitter on top of that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
although maybe it's annoying in like MW

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
although maybe it's annoying in like MW
one<00:01:29.310> where<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> m16<00:01:30.150> kill<00:01:30.390> someone<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.780> one

one where the m16 kill someone in one
shot<00:01:31.250> as<00:01:32.250> compared<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> black<00:01:33.030> ops<00:01:33.420> where<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
shot as compared to black ops where it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
shot as compared to black ops where it
takes<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.020> three<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.530> four<00:01:34.590> bursts<00:01:35.280> it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
takes like three or four bursts it's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
takes like three or four bursts it's
it's<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.909> annoying<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to see quickscoping back there was a lot

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.539 
to see quickscoping back there was a lot
of<00:01:53.850> fun<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.360> mw2<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.799> lot<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> people<00:01:56.520> really

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
of fun in mw2 and a lot of people really

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.039 
of fun in mw2 and a lot of people really
took<00:01:56.909> advantage<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:57.960> why

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
took advantage of that and that's why

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.450 
took advantage of that and that's why
they<00:01:58.259> took<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> black<00:01:58.920> ops<00:01:59.250> because

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
they took it out in black ops because

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.319 
they took it out in black ops because
they<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> lot<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> people<00:02:00.299> just

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
they don't want a lot of people just

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.109

say<00:04:55.750> they<00:04:55.780> wanted<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.169> be<00:04:56.290> more<00:04:56.710> realistic

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
say they wanted to be more realistic

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.879 
say they wanted to be more realistic
maybe<00:04:58.660> they<00:04:58.840> just<00:04:58.870> they<00:04:59.290> should<00:04:59.530> just<00:04:59.680> add<00:04:59.860> a

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
maybe they just they should just add a

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.860 
maybe they just they should just add a
realistic<00:05:00.580> mode<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.240> then<00:05:01.330> just<00:05:01.570> stick<00:05:01.720> with

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
realistic mode and then just stick with

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.610 
realistic mode and then just stick with
the<00:05:01.900> old<00:05:02.320> call<00:05:03.010> of<00:05:03.130> duty<00:05:03.400> type<00:05:04.240> damage<00:05:05.169> ratios

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
the old call of duty type damage ratios

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.129 
the old call of duty type damage ratios
and<00:05:05.889> health<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.430> all<00:05:06.520> that<00:05:06.760> but<00:05:07.510> for<00:05:07.990> anyone

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
and health and all that but for anyone

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.840 
and health and all that but for anyone
that<00:05:08.290> really<00:05:08.650> wants<00:05:08.889> realistic<00:05:09.430> gameplay

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
that really wants realistic gameplay

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.340 
that really wants realistic gameplay
they<00:05:10.270> should<00:05:10.419> have<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.600> separate<00:05:10.960> mode<00:05:11.169> for

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
they should have a separate mode for

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.810 
they should have a separate mode for
that<00:05:11.470> like<00:05:11.710> I'm<00:05:11.919> not<00:05:12.100> sure<00:05:12.220> if<00:05:12.310> hardcore<00:05:12.729> is

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
that like I'm not sure if hardcore is

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.120 
that like I'm not sure if hardcore is
exactly<00:05:13.240> realistic<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.710> maybe<00:05:14.919> have<00:05:15.100> a

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
exactly realistic but maybe have a

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.550 
exactly realistic but maybe have a
realistic<00:05:15.610> mode<00:05:16.000> if<00:05:16.210> possible<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.930> couldn't

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
realistic mode if possible I couldn't

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.040 
realistic mode if possible I couldn't
really<00:05:17.650> be<00:05:17.800> bothered<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.450> maybe<00:05:19.450> fix<00:05:19.840> the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
really be bothered and maybe fix the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.320 
really be bothered and maybe fix the
hitmarker<00:05:20.590> issues<00:05:20.979> and<00:05:21.160> every<00:05:21.310> single<00:05:21.669> call

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
hitmarker issues and every single call

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.420 
hitmarker issues and every single call
of<00:05:22.479> duty<00:05:22.750> game<00:05:23.020> especially<00:05:23.440> black<00:05:23.979> ops<00:05:24.250> there

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
of duty game especially black ops there

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.680 
of duty game especially black ops there
seems<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.669> be<00:05:24.729> a<00:05:24.760> lot<00:05:24.910> of<00:05:24.970> hit<00:05:25.180> markers<00:05:25.540> with

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
seems to be a lot of hit markers with

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.390 
seems to be a lot of hit markers with
snipers<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.139> everything<00:05:26.590> if<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.280> hit

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
snipers and everything if you hit

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:36.330 
snipers and everything if you hit
someone<00:05:27.639> off<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:33.840> 100<00:05:34.840> be<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:35.140> one-hit<00:05:35.680> kill<00:05:36.039> but

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
someone off a 100 be a one-hit kill but

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.800 
someone off a 100 be a one-hit kill but
usually<00:05:36.850> it<00:05:37.030> seems<00:05:37.270> to<00:05:37.360> get<00:05:37.450> a<00:05:37.510> lot<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.660> hit

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
usually it seems to get a lot of hit

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.330 
usually it seems to get a lot of hit
markers<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.380> they<00:05:38.590> really<00:05:38.860> should<00:05:39.039> fix<00:05:39.250> that

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
markers and they really should fix that

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.580 
markers and they really should fix that
and<00:05:39.729> if<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.390> shoot<00:05:40.600> someone<00:05:40.900> in<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.169> head<00:05:41.289> no

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
and if you shoot someone in the head no

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.750 
and if you shoot someone in the head no
matter<00:05:41.770> what<00:05:42.010> gun<00:05:42.160> it<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.430> they<00:05:42.700> should

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
matter what gun it is they should

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.240 
matter what gun it is they should
freaking<00:05:43.240> die<00:05:43.450> that's<00:05:44.289> also<00:05:44.500> very<00:05:44.680> annoying

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
freaking die that's also very annoying

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.029 
freaking die that's also very annoying
that<00:05:45.460> hopefully<00:05:45.970> they<00:05:46.120> can<00:05:46.180> fix<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:47.039> maybe

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
that hopefully they can fix and maybe

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.909 
that hopefully they can fix and maybe
some<00:05:48.400> vehicles<00:05:48.880> kind<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.210> like<00:05:49.360> world<00:05:50.320> at<00:05:50.530> war

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
some vehicles kind of like world at war

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.680 
some vehicles kind of like world at war
but<00:05:50.950> that<00:05:51.550> didn't<00:05:51.820> go<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:51.970> well<00:05:52.270> with<00:05:52.450> the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
but that didn't go so well with the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.270 
but that didn't go so well with the
tanks<00:05:53.050> because<00:05:53.169> if<00:05:53.440> you're<00:05:53.590> any<00:05:53.800> good<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.220> you

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
tanks because if you're any good and you

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.070 
tanks because if you're any good and you
knew<00:05:54.400> how<00:05:54.520> to<00:05:54.580> use<00:05:54.820> it<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.450> can<00:05:55.600> survive<00:05:55.900> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
knew how to use it you can survive the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.629 
knew how to use it you can survive the
whole<00:05:56.260> game<00:05:56.440> without<00:05:56.590> dying<00:05:56.979> and<00:05:57.220> just<00:05:57.340> camp

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
whole game without dying and just camp

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.129 
whole game without dying and just camp
with<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:57.940> tank<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.450> kill<00:05:58.720> every<00:05:59.110> single

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
with the tank and kill every single

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.980 
with the tank and kill every single
other<00:05:59.440> person<00:05:59.560> on<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.070> team<00:06:00.280> so<00:06:00.630> that<00:06:01.630> might

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
other person on the team so that might

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.870 
other person on the team so that might
be<00:06:02.020> not<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.410> greatest<00:06:02.680> idea<00:06:02.979> but<00:06:03.460> it<00:06:03.729> would

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
be not the greatest idea but it would

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.400 
be not the greatest idea but it would
bring<00:06:04.060> something<00:06:04.389> you<00:06:04.630> know<00:06:04.750> once<00:06:04.990> again<00:06:05.229> new

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
bring something you know once again new

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.469 
bring something you know once again new
to<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.710> table<00:06:05.889> so<00:06:06.789> I<00:06:06.820> hope<00:06:06.940> you<00:06:07.090> guys<00:06:07.240> have
