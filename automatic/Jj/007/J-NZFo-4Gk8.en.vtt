00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
you'll get it out but once you pull it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.380 
you'll get it out but once you pull it
out<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> way<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
out of the way as you can see this is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.359 
out of the way as you can see this is
pulled<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> way<00:01:58.200> enough<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.250> don't

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
pulled out of the way enough you don't

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.520 
pulled out of the way enough you don't
have<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> totally<00:02:00.000> remove<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.229> there's<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
have to totally remove it but there's a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.060 
have to totally remove it but there's a
Phillips<00:02:01.979> head<00:02:02.159> screw<00:02:02.520> right<00:02:02.759> there<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
Phillips head screw right there and

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.050 
Phillips head screw right there and
there's<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.369> Phillips<00:02:06.000> head<00:02:06.180> screw

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.800 

right<00:02:11.060> down<00:02:11.330> there<00:02:12.820> so<00:02:13.820> that's<00:02:14.360> out<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
right down there so that's out of the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.590 
right down there so that's out of the
way<00:02:14.840> enough<00:02:15.230> now<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.580> Phillips<00:02:17.150> head<00:02:17.330> screw

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
way enough now so Phillips head screw

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.560 
way enough now so Phillips head screw
there<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:18.770> there's<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:19.430> top<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
there and then there's one up top and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.560 
there and then there's one up top and
one<00:02:21.080> right<00:02:21.350> there<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:21.890> two<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.760> top<00:02:23.000> two<00:02:23.360> on

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
one right there so two on top two on

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.500 
one right there so two on top two on

switch hands here I can get my hand in

00:02:45.560 --> 00:03:08.199 
switch hands here I can get my hand in
there<00:03:05.260> once<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.410> get<00:03:06.590> all<00:03:06.709> these<00:03:06.950> four<00:03:07.760> screws

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
there once you get all these four screws

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.120 
there once you get all these four screws
out<00:03:09.040> holding<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.190> on<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:12.410> thing<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.860> pretty

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
out holding this on this thing is pretty

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.590 
out holding this on this thing is pretty
flexible<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:14.230> you're<00:03:15.230> able<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:16.450> pull<00:03:17.450> it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
flexible and you're able to pull it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.759 
flexible and you're able to pull it
forward<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.700> then<00:03:20.630> pull<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
forward like that and then pull this

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.979 
forward like that and then pull this
bottom<00:03:22.340> portion<00:03:22.580> up<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.620> slide<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.799> over<00:03:24.950> the

bottom portion up and slide it over the

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.390 
bottom portion up and slide it over the
steering<00:03:26.989> column<00:03:27.200> shroud<00:03:29.950> harder<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.070> do<00:03:31.250> with

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
steering column shroud harder to do with

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:41.710 
steering column shroud harder to do with
one<00:03:31.640> hand<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:33.880> get<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.090> idea<00:03:35.420> here<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:40.720> said

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
one hand but get the idea here so said

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.380 
one hand but get the idea here so said
it's<00:03:41.870> pretty<00:03:42.049> flexible<00:03:42.610> some<00:03:43.610> plastic<00:03:44.180> isn't

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
it's pretty flexible some plastic isn't

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.870 
it's pretty flexible some plastic isn't
real<00:03:44.690> flexible<00:03:45.970> without<00:03:46.970> braking<00:03:48.519> but<00:03:49.519> this

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
real flexible without braking but this

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.440 
real flexible without braking but this
is<00:03:50.060> pretty<00:03:50.299> flexible<00:03:51.880> just<00:03:52.880> got<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.239> get<00:03:53.330> it

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
is pretty flexible just got to get it

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.530 
is pretty flexible just got to get it
past<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.220> spots<00:03:55.220> inside<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.060> there<00:03:56.239> that

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
past the spots inside of there that

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.070 
past the spots inside of there that
makes<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.110> catch<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.330> there<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.900> two

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
makes it catch so there it is the two

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.410 
makes it catch so there it is the two
screws<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.799> there<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:02.600> two<00:04:02.810> down<00:04:03.080> below

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
screws up there and the two down below

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.570 
screws up there and the two down below
set<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.660> aside<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.230> from<00:04:06.470> there<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:07.549> just

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
set that aside and from there you just

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.820 
set that aside and from there you just
have<00:04:07.940> four<00:04:08.239> more<00:04:08.450> Phillips<00:04:08.930> screws<00:04:09.260> there's

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
have four more Phillips screws there's

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.539 
have four more Phillips screws there's
two<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.400> top<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:11.590> one<00:04:12.590> on<00:04:12.739> each<00:04:12.920> side<00:04:12.950> down

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.479 
below
holding<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.420> cluster<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:15.070> like<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.100> said<00:04:16.340> these

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
holding the cluster in like I said these

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.960 
holding the cluster in like I said these
are<00:04:16.549> already<00:04:16.850> out

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
are already out

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
and if you have an automatic you'll have

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.420 
and if you have an automatic you'll have
four<00:04:23.850> plugins<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:25.260> deal<00:04:25.500> with<00:04:25.740> if<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.190> have<00:04:26.400> a
