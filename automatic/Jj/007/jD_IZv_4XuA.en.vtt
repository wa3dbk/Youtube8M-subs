00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.050
 and of course we continue with a lot more here in my house and right now 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.889
 finds who directs or expressly with Ricardo that Ricardo is a designer 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.310
 gardens and it is a practice that this very very things for drying like these 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.330
 departure flights 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 the dd hh we are here 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.429
 when they are not the only ones doing it 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.739
 he claimed to demonstrate some types of plants for their interiors 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.010
 I am to contribute to raquel de bala 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.160
 we like all the plants we want to buy the faith that are on the lookout for 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.309
 house but not all are adequate to collect also the difference is greater 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.540
 good gives me 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.389
 Beyond a certain time when you give up on spaces like the climates 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.590
 here we have one that is called east of arabia 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 this is one of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.150
 e some varieties of the endorsements that exist in spite of feigning the day is accelerated 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.700
 this will be legal shade completely suits the shadow and the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.040
 sun there is no problem then in the zoologist in interior that was treated 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.050
 perfectly for this the in use of the water is very this 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.910
 imparted important because we need an irrigation that does not age sex and that does not 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.479
 miss 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.149
 it is preferable depending on the size of the pot an irrigation of up to half or 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.650
 half a liter per day 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 and a minimum constant fertilization to dedicate three months before to the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.030
 citizens 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.880
 for the most elegant 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.080
 that kind of plants you can adapt it to the shadow of Juan 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.840
 he has no problem in it in the solar flip colors and gave a little 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.860
 purple 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.500
 between purple and coffee 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.220
 in the shade he gets 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.590
 a color a green colorless by a hundred the soil to yesterday also great 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.920
 dimensions to two masters speaking some 5 6 meters tall in a pot is 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.039
 small its its dimensions 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.990
 does not grow to more than three meters 2 meters 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.350
 i is leafy this plant also the force of 40nm in pots for 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.859
 interiors needs a minimum daily watering of one liter of water 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.070
 fertilization is equal 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.789
 the last one exposed and zarca three months minimum 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.499
 For a better performance of the plant, it will be fine every month with subtlety in 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:18.039
 its defect in this type of plants what is called nitrofoska guti pleiss and 7 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.949
 the idea to grip its color reaffirms its foliage and this beautiful 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:22.889
 forever 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.459
 we have another here called racist palm 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.539
 that type of palm is only indoor 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.899
 stupor palming luxurious 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.019
 and she's very pretty 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.760
 he is characterized by his endings at the tips that are 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.279
 as well as a little nibbled 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.039
 you need a flower pot 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.359
 to twice the size of the burial of the root ball to the bottom of the 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.199
 land where the roots come 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.549
 so that the silver palm began to develop this palm has a height 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.549
 about two and a half meters three meters high 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:58.139
 slow development and it would take to reach that height an average of 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.029
 Some 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.209
 8 10 years 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.219
 They hope to find their arrival while the girls for many thanks 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.529
 chiclana necessary for this exercise the plant that what 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.369
 the one that you like and that fits what we are going with much more here 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.019
 in my house - this is televised
