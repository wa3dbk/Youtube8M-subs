previously<00:04:39.250> was<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.330> take<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.720> light<00:04:40.960> gauge

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
previously was to take a light gauge

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.260 
previously was to take a light gauge
piece<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.800> wire<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.460> actually<00:04:42.910> set<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.210> up

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
piece of wire and actually set it up

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.060 
piece of wire and actually set it up
from<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.600> battery<00:04:43.900> area<00:04:44.260> down<00:04:44.770> underneath

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
from the battery area down underneath

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.770 
from the battery area down underneath
the<00:04:45.220> vehicle<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.300> when<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.419> get<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.600> this

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
the vehicle so that when I get to this

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.360 
the vehicle so that when I get to this
point<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.199> could<00:04:47.290> just<00:04:47.530> take<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.830> take<00:04:48.010> my<00:04:48.160> wire

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
point I could just take and take my wire

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.400 
point I could just take and take my wire
to<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:48.940> use<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.870> pull<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.139> up<00:04:50.229> in

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
to it and use it to pull it up in

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.350 
to it and use it to pull it up in
through<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.400> engine<00:04:51.610> compartment<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.150> that

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
through the engine compartment and that

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.730 
through the engine compartment and that
makes<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.750> much<00:04:52.840> easier<00:04:58.440> okay<00:04:59.440> as<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.590> can<00:04:59.620> see

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
makes it much easier okay as you can see

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.469 
makes it much easier okay as you can see
now<00:05:00.010> we've<00:05:00.190> got<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.430> wire<00:05:00.610> routed<00:05:01.360> all<00:05:01.419> the

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
now we've got the wire routed all the

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.700 
now we've got the wire routed all the
way<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.840> positive<00:05:02.260> terminal<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.650> the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
way to the positive terminal of the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.080 
way to the positive terminal of the
battery<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.430> it's<00:05:03.550> time<00:05:03.699> to<00:05:03.790> go<00:05:03.880> ahead<00:05:04.000> and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
battery so it's time to go ahead and

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.550 
battery so it's time to go ahead and
make<00:05:04.180> our<00:05:04.240> connection<00:05:04.690> there<00:05:04.900> what<00:05:05.470> we're

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
make our connection there what we're

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.260 
make our connection there what we're
going<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:05.889> is<00:05:06.040> take<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.460> fuse<00:05:07.030> holder

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
going to do is take the fuse holder

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.310 
going to do is take the fuse holder
which<00:05:07.450> is<00:05:07.479> provided<00:05:07.960> with<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.110> installation

which is provided with the installation

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.770 
which is provided with the installation
kit<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:09.040> we're<00:05:09.940> going<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.090> take<00:05:10.300> this<00:05:10.450> loop<00:05:10.630> of

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
kit and we're going to take this loop of

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.560 
kit and we're going to take this loop of
wire<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:11.139> actually<00:05:11.380> cut<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.620> in<00:05:11.710> half<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:13.479> the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
wire and actually cut it in half to the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.790 
wire and actually cut it in half to the
one<00:05:13.690> end<00:05:13.870> we're<00:05:13.960> going<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.110> add<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.590> ring

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
to the black wire and that's going to

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.659 
to the black wire and that's going to
help<00:05:32.260> us<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.590> determine<00:05:33.100> how<00:05:33.220> much<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.490> length

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
help us to determine how much the length

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.939 
help us to determine how much the length
of<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.880> black<00:05:34.030> wire<00:05:34.270> we<00:05:34.449> actually<00:05:34.750> need<00:05:34.960> and

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
of the black wire we actually need and

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.460 
of the black wire we actually need and
you<00:05:36.760> can<00:05:36.820> see<00:05:37.030> here<00:05:37.180> I've<00:05:37.270> got<00:05:37.449> some<00:05:38.350> extra

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
you can see here I've got some extra

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.170 
you can see here I've got some extra
black<00:05:38.830> wire<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:39.400> I'm<00:05:39.520> just<00:05:39.610> going<00:05:39.760> to<00:05:39.789> cut<00:05:40.030> that

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
black wire so I'm just going to cut that

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.940 
black wire so I'm just going to cut that
to<00:05:40.360> length

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
to length

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.779 
to length
