00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.940
 vacuum actuator setting 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.690
 on a turbine with controlled geometry 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.460
 mean in order to properly 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.740
 adjust the length of the actuator is necessary 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.740
 remove the snap ring from here and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.560
 release control lobe vnt 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 mechanism from the rod of the vacuum actuator 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 after which you need to take to the extreme 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.770
 position to drain the oil petal to rest 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.170
 him and make sure that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.559
 the vacuum rod does not tighten it itself 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 yourself to 100 double bolt in this case 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 us stock length a little bit wrong it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.780
 need to lengthen 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.680
 in order for him to freely jump on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680
 vnt petal 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.290
 in this case, the rod length is greater than 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.970
 need i.e. petal extreme position 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.940
 is right here now 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.930
 further it does not move aside and the stem ring 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.180
 is farther if its now 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:01.900
 match by compressing the spring 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:04.060
 vacuum it turns out that the stock 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.060
 too much vacuum is crushed 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.240
 will work later than necessary 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.770
 when the turbine control valve will 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.770
 create the required vacuum level 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.090
 Now the difference here is I'm here now, I'm doing it 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:34.670
 and when i shoot him too 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.190
 pops forward he should pop up 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.120
 much less quite a bit creating 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.120
 small preload 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
 check 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.730
 now preload correct 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.480
 after after you made sure that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.130
 stem fully fitted position 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.850
 completely pulls the petal 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:46.550
 towards the oil line from the stop 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:50.050
 bolt and preload area 05 04 06 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:55.790
 millimeter when removing 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:58.820
 there is no more then you can see here 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.860
 a small gap that is, the stock is trying 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.920
 go a little further than the petal 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.560
 literally 0 4 max 6 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:13.340
 millimeter after this we combine 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:16.600
 pressing spring and fix by 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.600
 kontra nuts 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.240
 return the retaining ring 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.350
 check by vacuum 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.940
 serviceable vacuum actuator when 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.940
 clamp and hoses must keep a vacuum 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.729
 everything
