00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 people welcome to my 30 thousand 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.429
 Subscriber special my eye is fine 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.929
 better my hair look like one 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.809
 justin bieber joint hairstyle from before 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 and there are beautiful ones 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.690
 news for you namely my server 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 goes into the closed alpha minecraft 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.439
 server where I have been for five months 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.510
 already working with one 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 huge server team is going now 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 finally into the closed alpha what the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.179
 closed alpha for each which it no 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 concept is 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.840
 you have to give me one, for example 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.130
 Application write link to it of course 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 in the description where you then 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.200
 then apply for the closed alpha look 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 I like the cook soja is for 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.530
 the closed alpha or do not experience so 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
 So you have to write something like that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.370
 Often her minecraft plays on which 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 servers you should generally experience 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.730
 have and everything and if we just stop 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.989
 an active minecraft player since 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.030
 we need in the closed alpha 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.160
 really people who give us feedback 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 like the whole game modes are on 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 end if the claus just easy 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 you have to stop us then just 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 So things we say yes what loses 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 shit now or what 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.119
 thinks well now or what would you do 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.390
 Wish you for now, for example 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.900
 some game modes and for all of course 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.460
 are now not in the closed alpha pure 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.320
 have come or simply no desire 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.479
 have an application to write 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 I'll make a switch afterwards 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 or now a live stream 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.100
 at 18 o'clock where he will tell me then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.990
 two euro donations may therefore two euros 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.720
 and then probably similar in the closed 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 alpha 1 or 10 euros and then gets 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 her practically premium in the closed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.150
 alpha and one more month so if the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.680
 server is started then movies in the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.880
 alpha and beta and closed beta something 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 finished you are then always in who the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 ten euros will donate and then get 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.810
 additionally afterwards premium for one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 month I think the whole thing quite well 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.829
 Acts why I do it that way 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.930
 is simply the server that costs 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.030
 really a lot of money so we want 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.979
 real huge minecraft network 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.049
 we want to be big i want big 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.909
 servers make that no live server 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.649
 is really a project I would have really 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.540
 aldi but mega buck and until now 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.399
 we had has just made everything 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.450
 paid your own pocket and how many of 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.310
 you know 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.989
 is a server with somehow 1000 slot 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.060
 or with a lot of computing power and 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.950
 in the whole fucking stretches really much 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.970
 That's why we just need money 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.680
 I just need a just like that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.640
 little support your what that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.260
 That's why I'm very, too 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.690
 grateful or would be very grateful if 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.980
 then just a little bit in the stream 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.900
 what donates because I'm not straight 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.459
 the wealthiest mean my parents 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.349
 are not somehow now I know what 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.750
 george clooney or jesus or so now 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.430
 live in money but just stop altogether 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 normal people like you, of course 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.410
 that's why it's not there for everyone out there 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760
 is to be accepted next to it 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.360
 the chance if you just stop me then 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.130
 two euros donated via twitter that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.360
 then you come in or stop 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.269
 just ten euros they with premium 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 there is also a big innovation 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.099
 From Monday, there are new motifs in the fog 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.360
 is red shirt shop that is general 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.250
 something I am very happy about now 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.470
 finally my draftsman back again 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.299
 is after a long absence that is it 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.680
 will now be several more in the future 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.910
 give motives and I guess I will 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.590
 synonymous surfaces make video 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.000
 that's just new motives I give 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.030
 I think that would be pretty 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.459
 quite a chorale for you anyway 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.600
 yes my network has a bit 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.299
 killed around 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.609
 that's why the first motivation comes on 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:29.329
 monday the 30 motives namely once the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.329
 kiwis the lettering 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.740
 and of course it does not drip 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.860
 let them forget the three 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.380
 new motives are also found 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.470
 in the description a link to a 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.330
 fog eex child package what me before 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.190
 What I did was eternity 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.020
 never uploaded because it's always like that 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.150
 what should be such a special and 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.620
 actually was for 20,000 subscribers 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.610
 special already the server stop 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.000
 planned but then there was also 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.590
 I have problems the 30.000 resp 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.580
 31,500 I do not know how fast that 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.560
 but it is definitely very 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.920
 thank you so much for making me fast 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.270
 very happy and definitely takes 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.180
 that's just a bit so mean 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.370
 Friends I hope the special like 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.680
 So you just stop minecraft 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.020
 server for the community for me for 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.090
 all for the world finally it is so far 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.560
 I am also pretty blatant 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.840
 on it and I hope, of course, happy 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.500
 i also do many youtubers always 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.880
 something like 30,000 bild.de burns special 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.590
 but that's just not for me 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.390
 I think so own 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.670
 Minecraft keeps that is already real 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.680
 a special that has it all 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.240
 That's why I hope they will not 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.240
 disappointed that now is not so what comes 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.280
 the best of or best of fun i moments 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.250
 foggy or as far as everyone is honest 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.510
 who has subscribed longer knows yes 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.440
 already the whole family with and had to 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.210
 Do not look at yourself again 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.070
 that's why it would be world superior 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.010
 somehow not so hot I say times 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.140
 that he is so fucking a video now 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.160
 where comes any scenes from me 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.470
 I'm just together then 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.810
 that cuts everyone but I would 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.880
 just say minecraft server is now 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.530
 not the most commonplace 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.910
 Subscriber special that's why I hope 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.610
 that you like the special as well 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.490
 from monday new t-shirts are sending 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.050
 switch over on access 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.460
 any case so if he misses nothing 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.530
 if that is in principle the whole 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.510
 the special is similar to the one 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.040
 minecraft server is online and me 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.650
 hope that we do not have any today 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.450
 have complications and everything and 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.680
 are tomorrow by the way tomorrow's 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.720
 probably also a stream again 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.530
 By the way, there is tomorrow 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.690
 a stream 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.590
 there is a new one 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.980
 There are game modes that still exist today 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.350
 Not 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.460
 if it 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.780
 a little bit more for a few years 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.400
 be filmed around the 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.950
 programmer does not have that much time left 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.390
 That's why you will not have time today 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.910
 have tomorrow is of course a 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.960
 live stream there you can also 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.460
 Donate diligently because I mean so 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.690
 server did not pay by itself and me 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.120
 Hope you understand that I am now 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.330
 not money or anything but it 's just 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.100
 just really really expensive and I think so 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
 to know the most that's really 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.980
 That's why I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.790
 I am looking forward to your support 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:08.870
 that you turn on and of course me 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.870
 loyal to me and I say oh
