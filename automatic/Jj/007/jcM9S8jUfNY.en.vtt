00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello friends my name is Sergey 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.689
 love today will tell you why he 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.979
 I do not really want to play in the street 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.410
 tanks and indeed in almost any 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.660
 network toy that can offer 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.150
 on modern igroprom 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.430
 do you play network mobs there 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.560
 plays or just doesnâ€™t want 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.300
 play with equal players as his 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.290
 Thai team on enemy team 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.870
 accordingly have some 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.020
 possibility of balancing force i.e. 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.560
 in its own way lh whether what happens if i 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.149
 I play there that time in my teams 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.120
 Generally, both teams had average 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.500
 players but for the tour everyone who plays 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.260
 world of tanks knows how many here 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.660
 deer and so i lost 3 days so i dont 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.590
 played nine months this game I played 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 three days and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.670
 you know, everything plays when you're in a fight 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.890
 really make two three kilos are you 4000 there 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.480
 demedzha took out from there but you lost 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.000
 just because there are two in that team 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.489
 kvass which demedzha panel made of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.230
 even in addition pitch demage if I though 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.170
 would have twice been a dad 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.239
 was a victory seriously and now because of such 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.700
 games and honestly do not really want to play with 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.619
 the pleasure of the game is not necessary 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.329
 somehow in the jab choose so on 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.520
 sure you need stress 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.679
 and this is clearly not my approach to games, and here 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.209
 this one is a very visual short fight 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:24.679
 looking t-54 it is 47 percent but 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:26.709
 watch it simple and challenger okay 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.840
 maybe he wants to germinate and 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.189
 shine it takes practically 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.159
 symmetrical position I shot at 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.020
 I ignore his drum okay 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.439
 wait recharge less whole there 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.439
 so many 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.600
 dohrena seconds to reload 15 point 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.909
 recharging drum he sticks out someone 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.099
 trying to shoot there roll out and so 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.719
 Further, but in principle, we tightened 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.569
 this position was not to go but it is not 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.969
 the most interesting i just keep it 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.149
 asshole and he doesn't like that 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.210
 reacts to watch seriously and he just 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.119
 worth and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.820
 and dies and that's all he did in this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.780
 fight and duck yes in your team by 23 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.610
 here comes such a person 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.920
 not serious for me 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.170
 the desire to play this game comes down 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.900
 to a minimum because I did not get into it 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.209
 fun usually does not happen 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.810
 interesting battle of torture and turbo drain here 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.760
 after all, it was already 41 and it was a pump lunch I 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.150
 I do not remember how it all ended but the essence 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.340
 in that its so balance and such here 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.070
 The situation in the games definitely do not 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.660
 me fans of similar games and okay power 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.340
 in Russia you can assemble your team 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.769
 run with those with whom you are to someone 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.230
 trust you believe in the new game you can 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.030
 play 5 on 5 is also a team but here but 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.830
 there you can clan warriors 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.230
 some stupid card to play but all 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.910
 it really does not like does not apply 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.730
 because just go get the fuck 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.350
 half an hour to go then you can train 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.820
 know any garbage not related to 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.580
 just go enjoy it 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.060
 games so here you go 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.360
