be<00:00:47.730> still<00:00:48.719> viable<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> pretty

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
be still viable and it's a pretty

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
be still viable and it's a pretty
exciting<00:00:50.460> bill<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.660> basic<00:00:52.260> tempest

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680

rush<00:00:52.920> build<00:00:53.250> um<00:00:54.559> my<00:00:55.559> primary<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.430> i'm<00:00:56.910> using<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
rush build um my primary is i'm using a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.470 
rush build um my primary is i'm using a
way<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> hundred<00:00:58.559> fists<00:00:58.879> with<00:00:59.879> blazing<00:01:00.239> fist

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
way of a hundred fists with blazing fist

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.110 
way of a hundred fists with blazing fist
the<00:01:01.350> reason<00:01:01.680> why<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.070> credit<00:01:02.489> increase<00:01:02.820> your

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the reason why is credit increase your

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
the reason why is credit increase your
attack<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
attack I really don't like it for the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
attack I really don't like it for the
attack<00:01:05.549> speed<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> movement<00:01:07.260> speed

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
attack speed but for the movement speed

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
attack speed but for the movement speed
and<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.520> very<00:01:08.970> important<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and that's a very very important is to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
and that's a very very important is to
be<00:01:10.530> able<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.920> through<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> run<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.580> fast

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
be able to get through the run as fast

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.460 
be able to get through the run as fast
as<00:01:12.240> possible<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:13.260> might<00:01:13.740> even<00:01:14.060> switch<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.470> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
as possible I might even switch it up to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.090 
as possible I might even switch it up to
fist<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> thunder<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.710> quickening<00:01:19.710> which

fist a thunder and do quickening which

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
fist a thunder and do quickening which
will<00:01:20.460> probably<00:01:20.670> try<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.150> Tim's<00:01:22.110> rush

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
will probably try that out Tim's rush
