00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
hi guys I want to give you a little bit

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.509 
hi guys I want to give you a little bit
of<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.330> description<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.899> how<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.140> make<00:00:07.519> panels

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
of a description of how to make panels

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.410 
of a description of how to make panels
so<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:09.870> our<00:00:10.759> overhead<00:00:11.759> panel<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
so here is my our overhead panel as it

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.919 
so here is my our overhead panel as it
is<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.639> I'm<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.969> explain<00:00:15.540> how<00:00:15.599> our

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
is now and I'm going to explain how our

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.200 
is now and I'm going to explain how our
hell<00:00:16.890> made<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.400> panels<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:19.039> made<00:00:20.210> by

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
hell made this panels they all made by

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.500 
hell made this panels they all made by
me<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:24.060> I'll<00:00:24.119> go<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.269> C&amp;C<00:00:24.630> rail<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.359> all

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
me so I'll go to C&amp;C rail here and all

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.000 
me so I'll go to C&amp;C rail here and all
these<00:00:27.810> panels<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.289> were<00:00:28.349> routed

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
these panels they were routed

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.080 
these panels they were routed
right<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.449> CNC<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> process

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
right here on this CNC so the process

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.110 
right here on this CNC so the process
begins<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:34.399> just<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.550> plain<00:00:35.790> sheet<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
begins with them just a plain sheet of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.690 
begins with them just a plain sheet of
acrylic<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.070> four<00:00:38.309> point<00:00:38.520> five

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
acrylic so I use the four point five

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420 
acrylic so I use the four point five
millimeter<00:00:39.360> wide<00:00:39.570> acrylic<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> there's

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
millimeter wide acrylic so there's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
millimeter wide acrylic so there's
actually<00:00:42.410> people<00:00:43.410> wide<00:00:43.739> inside<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:46.410> can

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
actually people wide inside and you can

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.529 
actually people wide inside and you can
see<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:48.289> how<00:00:49.289> wide<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> use<00:00:54.270> them

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
see here how wide it is so I use them

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.910 
see here how wide it is so I use them
this<00:00:55.079> model<00:00:55.469> master<00:00:55.649> paint<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.699> paint<00:00:56.879> it

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
this model master paint to paint it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
this model master paint to paint it
so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> find<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.340> quite<00:00:59.550> suitable<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.300> um<00:01:00.480> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so I find it quite suitable and um it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
so I find it quite suitable and um it
looks<00:01:01.469> quite<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.579> quite<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> bit<00:01:03.359> like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
looks quite a bit as quite a bit like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.950 
looks quite a bit as quite a bit like
blowing<00:01:03.809> green<00:01:04.140> paint<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:06.479> save<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
blowing green paint to save on the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.880 
blowing green paint to save on the
actual<00:01:07.260> top<00:01:07.860> coat<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> use<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.650> cheap<00:01:10.650> black

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actual top coat I use this cheap black

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.130 
actual top coat I use this cheap black
paint<00:01:11.689> multiple<00:01:12.689> coats<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.869> cover

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
paint multiple coats of it to to cover

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.749 
paint multiple coats of it to to cover
three<00:01:16.409> weeks<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.070> does<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.460> transmit

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
three weeks so that it does not transmit

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
three weeks so that it does not transmit
any<00:01:18.030> light<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.470> isn't

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
any light so you can see that it isn't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
any light so you can see that it isn't
it<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.250> transparent<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> light<00:01:24.049> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it is not transparent to the light so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
it is not transparent to the light so
you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> painted<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> acrylic<00:01:26.369> sheet<00:01:26.720> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you can in painted the acrylic sheet is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.679 
you can in painted the acrylic sheet is
then<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> tip<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> CNC<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> do

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
then down to the tip to the CNC to do

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.270 
then down to the tip to the CNC to do
the<00:01:30.780> work<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> an<00:01:32.250> example<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.909> panel

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
the work here is an example of one panel

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.030 
the work here is an example of one panel
so<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.490> engraved<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> cut<00:01:39.079> then<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.229> must<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
so it is engraved and cut then I must of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.940 
so it is engraved and cut then I must of
the<00:01:41.670> panel<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.450> paint<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> edges<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the panel to paint the edges because the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.740 
the panel to paint the edges because the
edge<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.189> obviously<00:01:44.610> wide<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.479> see

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
edge is obviously wide so you can see

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.069 
edge is obviously wide so you can see
leo<00:01:47.060> see<00:01:48.060> where<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.329> must<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.689> tape<00:01:48.869> has

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
leo see where they must can tape has

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.590 
leo see where they must can tape has
been<00:01:49.110> attached<00:01:49.560> before

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.300 

there<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.900> panel<00:02:02.330> just<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.990> bit<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> note

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
there is the panel just a bit of a note

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.330 
there is the panel just a bit of a note
on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> tools<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.030> use<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> mainly<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.940> use<00:02:09.240> a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
on the tools I use so mainly if I use a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.360 
on the tools I use so mainly if I use a
two<00:02:11.340> millimeter<00:02:11.690> single<00:02:12.690> fluid<00:02:13.020> envy<00:02:16.370> like

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
two millimeter single fluid envy like

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.730 
two millimeter single fluid envy like
this<00:02:17.580> one<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.890> used<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.310> cutting<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.740> I

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
this one and is used for cutting and I

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.200 
this one and is used for cutting and I
use<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:24.020> number<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.880> ingredient<00:02:26.880> eights

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
use a number of ingredient eights

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.980 
use a number of ingredient eights
ranging<00:02:27.870> from<00:02:28.050> our<00:02:28.290> 0.1<00:02:28.950> millimeter<00:02:29.540> up<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
ranging from our 0.1 millimeter up to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.400 
ranging from our 0.1 millimeter up to
0.5<00:02:31.560> millimeters<00:02:35.240> well<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:37.110> would<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
0.5 millimeters well this would be the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.960 
0.5 millimeters well this would be the
an<00:02:37.890> example<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.050> simpler<00:02:40.410> panels

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
an example of one of the simpler panels

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.100 
an example of one of the simpler panels
more<00:02:41.970> complicated<00:02:42.630> panels<00:02:44.600> or<00:02:45.600> complicated

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
more complicated panels or complicated

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.290 
more complicated panels or complicated
things<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:46.770> something<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.340> so

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
things will look something like that so

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.380 
things will look something like that so
to<00:02:48.720> make<00:02:48.870> these<00:02:49.290> panels<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:50.640> from<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.970> usual

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
to make these panels but from the usual

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.450 
to make these panels but from the usual
engraving<00:02:52.200> cutting<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:52.830> will<00:02:52.980> also<00:02:53.160> need<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
engraving cutting you will also need to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.580 
engraving cutting you will also need to
make<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> Anteaters<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:55.290> are<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.440> see

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
make the Anteaters so they are not see
