 for the first time I introduced you 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 an anime that is based on a video game 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.219
 now let's move on to a brief summary of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.230
 the animated story takes place in the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.739
 prestigious high school that you gamine and at 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.020

 it says that the elite of Japan they are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.680
 graduates to hope to get in there need to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.129
 to be the best of the best in this 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 field 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.840
 makoto naji an ordinary high school student is 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.420
 accepted in this school by a draw at 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 fate of the luckiest yet day 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 of his return he finds himself locked up 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 in the establishment with 14 new 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.520
 students who excels all in one area 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.860
 then from the top athlete to the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 idol singer going through the genie 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 computer or even the worst at kayes 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 he felt that luck 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.409
 was with him but will be traveling very fast 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 that he is nothing in recontrant 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.049
 mono kuma the director teddy bear 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 this one explains to his class rules 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.689
 morbid school 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 the only way out of 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.000
 the establishment is to have his 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.680
 diploma 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.930
 and to get it the students are going to have to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.119
 to kill one of their comrades without 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.090
 get caught by others if the killer 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.280
 is discovered it is then executed but 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
 if he gets his way safely 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.119
 during the allotted time 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 they are automatically 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.710
 graduates and the remaining comrades are 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.560
 so executed so the only question that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.979
 wonders who will survive this year 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.530
 school 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.360
 now we will move to the positive point 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 of the animated as usual we are going 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.020
 start with the scenario that has the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.270
 deserves not to be unsurprising in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.950
 what concerns him is here that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.959
 hide all the originality of the anime 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.760
 while one might believe in putting 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.980
 in place of a survival game it's 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.750
 finally towards an aspect 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.909
 more thoughtful that he turns with a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.220
 trial and investigation of the deaths of the 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.110
 series turn us to which I do not go 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.150
 did not wait but who is far from me 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.920
 displease the episodes are exciting 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.640
 and takes place very quickly see often 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.069
 too fast 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.629
 in return we do not get bored 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.060
 actions and events follow each other with 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.739
 speed leaving few quiet passages 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.180
 and time-out with investigations 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.730
 involving the viewer in a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.829
 pleasant investigation that puts turn to 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.299
 turn the characters into doubt the 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.220
 court passages are enough 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.989
 captivating with lively exchanges and 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.000
 sometimes images and I come now 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.549
 at a point that has an asset to the anime 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.079
 it's the atmosphere in this kind of series 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.609
 we could logically expect to 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.620
 something quite dramatic 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.959
 but it offers us an atmosphere that 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.269
 would be closer to comedy this 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.370
 anime and greatly reduces 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.349
 dramatic scope of events even 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.390
 the execution of the culprit to something 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.489
 of comedy with his 10th that I 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.010
 found that very well thought is enough 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.560
 succeeded there is even a censorship of the blood 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.129
 being of a very pronounced rose that can 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.440
 bother 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.269
 however, we get used to it quite 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
 easily like the offbeat spirit of the 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.220
 series integration of elements 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.290
 clean graphics video game interface n 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.239
 killing and so on childhood 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.250
 the graphic identity and atmosphere of 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.799
 the animated which is a very good thing 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.540
 but the main reason for the desire to 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.700
 continue the series is the suspense 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.139
 well woven throughout the series l and 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
 twists that are very 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.220
 surprising now let's talk about 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.590
 animated characters very good and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.169
 benefit from a box spirit zf hug well 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.419
 implanted thanks primarily to mono common 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.790
 who is the teddy bear with the double 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.769
 face that embodies well the paradox of this 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.599
 on one side it is someone who 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.160
 have fun a little alone that seems 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.750
 play a game and that sometimes seems 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.349
 almost attentive with some 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.480
 characters 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.340
 on the other hand he enjoys seeing 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.109
 the students tear themselves apart and this is a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.730
 particularly mischievous person 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.099
 who does not hesitate to intervene for 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.169
 defend his interests one of the passages 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.879
 who made me laugh the most is like 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.669
 uno like learns like punching-ball at 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.290
 fish the comic aspect also appears 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.269
 with the other characters with their 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.849
 cars to design that is quite particular 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.220
 very original and colorful presented 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.780
 quickly during the first episode 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.190
 each character manages to find his 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.050
 place through characters and a 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.820
 very distinct physical what makes them 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.890
 more or less endearing in 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.810
 regards the main character naji 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.580
 it's a bit of a character it's pretty 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.320
 and not very impressive from the top of 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.940
 his 1m 60 but he will play a role 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.440
 important in the resolution of 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.420
 business and earned insurance 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.000
 until the end where his role will be 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.920
 determining with regard to the opening 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.140
 and the ending I find them not bad 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.630
 but neither very good now we will pass 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.800
 at the only negative point of the anime that is 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.440
 disadvantageous 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.490
 it's the format of 13 episodes they 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.230
 prevent telling a story 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.030
 clear and concise and this is especially 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.640
 visible when solving riddles 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.320
 so much simplify the scenario we 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.830
 therefore appears less dense than it is 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.660
 Actually 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.730
 and the protagonists in number 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.530
 relatively consistent are not 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.660
 properly developed and by 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.700
 therefore the viewer attaches myself to it 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.890
 because of this lack of episodes the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.990
 series is not enough on its own 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.580
 which gives the unpleasant impression of 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.800
 having to play the game to fill that 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.810
 lack of explanation regarding 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.669
 the end I found them really good he 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.800
 has a lot of revelations and most 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.169
 questions find answers but 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.910
 not everything unfortunately it's an end 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.440
 which still left me hungry and 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.690
 I hope there will be a sequel 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.430
 so to conclude it's an animated that 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.960
 I took pleasure in viewing for 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.580
 its originality 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.979
 even if more episodes would have allowed 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.690
 to be even better so this is it 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.729
 fifth episode of animated critics 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.500
 manga is over so if you call 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.030
 do not hesitate to leave a baby 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.919
 to leave your opinion in the comments 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.650
 and to subscribe if you are not 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.210
 still the poll for the 6th anime and 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.310
 in the description so do not forget 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.600
 to vote and so we end up for a 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.460
 new video very soon 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 go take care of yourself and at the 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.600
 next in everyone
