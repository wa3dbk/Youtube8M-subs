00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and join duplicate this layer twice so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
and join duplicate this layer twice so
we<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> by<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.610> ctrl<00:01:33.119> +<00:01:33.240> J<00:01:33.360> or

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
we can do that by going to ctrl + J or

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.399 
we can do that by going to ctrl + J or
command<00:01:33.930> +<00:01:34.049> J<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> Mac<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
command + J if you have a Mac so do that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
command + J if you have a Mac so do that

that we're going to go bring on the next
layer<00:02:04.070> click<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.700> we're<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> go

to screen
and<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.940> will<00:02:13.120> really<00:02:13.420> brightens<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.050> image

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
and this will really brightens the image

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
we're going to go and change the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
the constant and as you can see it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.699 
the constant and as you can see it
really<00:02:50.770> makes<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.640> darker<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:53.140> brings<00:02:53.440> in

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
really makes it darker and it brings in

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.220 
the color a bit more so I'm going to go
for<00:02:56.620> around<00:02:56.800> about<00:02:57.040> minus<00:02:58.000> 58<00:02:58.420> for<00:02:58.780> this<00:03:01.230> but

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230

at<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> others<00:03:49.930> what<00:03:50.170> they've<00:03:50.320> turned<00:03:50.560> out

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
at the others what they've turned out

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.600 
at the others what they've turned out
like<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.820> there's<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.299> one<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:54.040> as<00:03:54.340> we<00:03:54.489> can

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
like so there's this one so as we can

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.140 
like so there's this one so as we can
see<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:55.150> just<00:03:55.350> paled<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.590> down<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.400> really

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
see it just paled it down and really

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.680 
see it just paled it down and really
bought<00:03:58.360> in<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.070> dark<00:04:00.070> tones<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.299> shadows

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
bought in the dark tones and the shadows

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.530 
bought in the dark tones and the shadows
and<00:04:02.489> we're<00:04:03.489> really<00:04:03.730> going<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.000> go<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.239> this

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and we're really going to go to this

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.759 
and we're really going to go to this
next<00:04:04.750> one<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:05.739> we<00:04:05.890> just<00:04:06.299> take<00:04:07.299> off<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:07.810> this

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
next one so if we just take off and this

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.340 
next one so if we just take off and this
one<00:04:09.010> was<00:04:09.130> quite<00:04:09.340> vibrant<00:04:10.019> but<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.140> was<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> bit

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
one was quite vibrant but it was a bit

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.920 
one was quite vibrant but it was a bit
too<00:04:11.709> tacky<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.610> my<00:04:12.760> liking<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.570> was<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> bit

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
too tacky for my liking so it was a bit

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.699 
too tacky for my liking so it was a bit
too<00:04:14.670> in-your-face<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.049> really<00:04:17.320> wanted<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
too in-your-face and we really wanted to

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.069 
too in-your-face and we really wanted to
bring<00:04:17.829> that<00:04:18.160> luxurious<00:04:18.970> feel<00:04:19.359> into<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.930> image

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
bring that luxurious feel into the image

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.610 
bring that luxurious feel into the image
so<00:04:20.799> we<00:04:20.979> just<00:04:21.160> turned<00:04:21.580> it<00:04:21.729> down<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:23.440> is

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
so we just turned it down and this is

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.080 
so we just turned it down and this is
why<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.890> ends<00:04:24.099> up<00:04:24.280> like

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
why it ends up like

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.600 
why it ends up like
so<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:26.110> really<00:04:26.139> depends<00:04:26.770> on<00:04:27.010> your<00:04:27.130> taste<00:04:27.190> you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
so it really depends on your taste you

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.920 
so it really depends on your taste you
can<00:04:27.760> play<00:04:27.910> around<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.300> scenes<00:04:28.540> just
