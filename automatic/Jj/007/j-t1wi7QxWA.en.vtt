00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
silicone right here so let's go ahead

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.209 
silicone right here so let's go ahead
and<00:01:21.539> just<00:01:21.749> put<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.289> phone<00:01:22.499> in<00:01:22.649> there<00:01:22.859> as<00:01:23.009> we

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
and just put the phone in there as we

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
would with any normal rubber case we

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.620 
would with any normal rubber case we
just<00:01:25.499> simply<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.389> there<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
just simply kind of put it in there and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
just simply kind of put it in there and
fold<00:01:28.109> the<00:01:28.350> sides<00:01:28.560> onto<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.310> phone<00:01:29.609> the

putting<00:01:30.569> on<00:01:30.719> of<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:30.990> case<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.499> little

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
putting on of the case is a little

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.859 
putting on of the case is a little
difficult<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.090> takes<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.450> little<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
difficult and it takes a little bit of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.989 
difficult and it takes a little bit of
force<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.319> actually<00:01:34.829> get<00:01:35.039> this<00:01:35.249> on<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:35.729> kind

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
force to actually get this on which kind

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.609 
force to actually get this on which kind
of<00:01:36.090> bothered<00:01:36.420> me<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:36.749> I<00:01:37.020> didn't<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.560> to

snap<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.219> brittle<00:01:39.030> plastic<00:01:39.539> piece<00:01:39.719> right

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
snap this brittle plastic piece right

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.929 
snap this brittle plastic piece right
here<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.859> doesn't<00:01:41.039> seem<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.459> be<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.609> big

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
here but it doesn't seem to be that big

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.730 
here but it doesn't seem to be that big
of<00:01:41.999> a<00:01:42.119> problem<00:01:42.389> and<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> seems<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.469> pretty

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
of a problem and it seems to be pretty

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590 
of a problem and it seems to be pretty
durable<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.789> kind<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.999> have<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> snap

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
durable so you just kind of have to snap

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.219 
durable so you just kind of have to snap
it<00:01:45.780> onto<00:01:45.959> the<00:01:46.170> sides<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:46.679> here<00:01:47.039> until<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
it onto the sides right here until it is

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.279 
it onto the sides right here until it is
fit<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.920> once<00:01:50.219> again<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.850> access<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
fit so once again we have access to the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.109 
fit so once again we have access to the
headphone<00:01:52.859> jack<00:01:52.889> the<00:01:53.399> microphone<00:01:53.909> right

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
headphone jack the microphone right

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.059 
headphone jack the microphone right
there<00:01:54.389> we<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.109> power<00:01:55.319> button<00:01:55.619> which<00:01:55.920> we

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
there we have the power button which we

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.919 
there we have the power button which we
can<00:01:56.219> simply<00:01:56.609> press<00:01:56.789> now<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.749> can<00:01:57.899> see

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
can simply press now and as you can see

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.199 
can simply press now and as you can see
it<00:01:58.289> is<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.889> more<00:01:59.130> flush<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.090> could

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
it is a bit more flush and you could

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.910 
it is a bit more flush and you could
barely<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> right<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.799> have

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
barely see it right there you have

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.589 
barely see it right there you have
nothing<00:02:02.099> on<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.520> side<00:02:02.759> where<00:02:02.999> normally<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
nothing on this side where normally the

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.569 
nothing on this side where normally the
SIM<00:02:03.810> card<00:02:04.109> tray<00:02:04.170> would<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.069> you<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.429> have

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
SIM card tray would be so you don't have

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.240 
SIM card tray would be so you don't have
that<00:02:05.729> accessible<00:02:06.359> you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.709> dock
