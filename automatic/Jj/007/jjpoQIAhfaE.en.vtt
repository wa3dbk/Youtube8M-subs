00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.670

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.869
 on and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.099
 yes I I wanted to just now times 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.510
 imagine she has said she has 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.830
 Also shown what you bought so do 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.660
 I do that now in this whole 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.709
 purchase i have no idea how long 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.510
 which should hold 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.750
 foto christina says that you are extremely much 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.489
 Eating must be around the calorie calories too 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.290
 get the things you need and that's why 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.000
 I have that to the word now 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.950
 took 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.260
 I only bought things in the offer 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.630
 I have now for this whole yield 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.370
 I paid 31 or 31 euros here 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.110
 actually quite ok, honestly 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.840
 That was really a lot and I have to 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.970
 say the melon a lot of it 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.220
 made out because I was really that stupid 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.930
 I bought him the watermelon that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.940
 99 cents are on it was natural 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.590
 meant the kilo and I thought there 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.769
 the cost and 90 cents I take with me 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.630
 but now it has five euros 55 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.650
 tasted and I was too cowardly at the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.510
 to leave cash register 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.519
 I know that's a lot, but ultimately 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.799
 it is also a lot of water 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.569
 so well ok so I have quite 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.400
 bought a lot of bananas I have somehow 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.170
 the feeling that will be my emergency 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.790
 food is because banani and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.100
 I really like to saturate sometimes 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.090
 in case with high fruit acid the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.549
 I feel that there is more 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.540
 stomach growls of wars as it 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.320
 actually as I actually do 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.190
 intended 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.660
 then I bought the last one 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.600
 I press then I find it 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.640
 It's a pity because I do not do it that way 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.019
 I like making juices. I prefer making smoothies 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.010
 because I do not like that much fruit 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.650
 throw away 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.329
 but orange puree works with it 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.170
 my mixa not so good then I have 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.239
 once bought pears it costs each one 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.400
 because 1 something then I have one 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.930
 Pineapple bought 199 but tasted 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.030
 that was a huge one because of that 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.280
 they then took the cheapest 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.810
 apple so network has somehow one 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.090
 still cost something and that's yes 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.609
 really a lot of apples then 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.380
 I bought the honey melon 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.310
 I have for kevin so the kevin wanted 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.810
 necessarily have that I would 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.609
 usually not taken because the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.810
 249 costs and I actually wanted it 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.579
 really cheap 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.130
 but this also has something to do with it then 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.260
 stop as I said the watermelon then 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.630
 we say here is I've been using 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.410
 Lemons taken with this monster 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.120
 lemon 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.049
 Incidentally, I want to say this is not a 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.340
 bio I have not bought the bio 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.960
 I just can not afford it 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.250
 Can not spend two weeks in organic products 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.090
 I just can not buy and I do not buy 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.610
 I'm not that kind of 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.669
 I'm so sorry for biokÃ¤ufer 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.889
 I bought flames then I have 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.020
 Nektarinen here then I have one 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.520
 mango that was also down now 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.409
 I still cost 99 cents 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.509
 always a bit expensive I have to say 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.060
 for a fruit but mangoes are 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.500
 expensive i wanted to have them now and 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.840
 then I have here only two now 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.020
 But I bought a lot of avocados 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.889
 bought in lidl currently 77 cents cost 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.629
 and they cost 149 to 199 everywhere else 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.190
 so if you want to buy avocados 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.830
 definitely go to the lidl so I 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.129
 I bought the cost only 79 cents 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.539
 then I bought too much the cost 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.699
 are aldi always down there 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.289
 costs somehow five pieces or four 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.430
 or five pieces you always get there for 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.620
 129 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.020
 then I have the cheapest tomatoes 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.729
 I bought tomatoes 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.199
 usually always so I sell 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.379
 that's why I hope you too 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.550
 Taste tomatoes are always like that 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.349
 One thing I do not think so 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.389
 I'll do that again 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.520
 spring onion for somehow 40 cents 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.169
 bought because I have normal onions and 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.289
 red onions so not tolerate 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.729
 and I think that 's it and look 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.440
 How long will I see you? 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.580
 every case how long I use it 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.680
 get there 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.259
 hello people i am right now 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.550
 opted for the simple variant 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.430
 to make a video like wobbly 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.650
 because I give you a short a short 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.000
 I would like to give update today 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.740
 for breakfast how loud for one 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 three quarter liter of water drunk with 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.000
 lemon slices in it 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.850
 yes I am very disgusting I have one 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.680
 get a bit stomach pain from it 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:16.660
 but then there was something like dollars 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.400
 and then I once did courage 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.780
 Now the lemon is in it today 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.610
 tomorrow was in the water because I was not 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.610
 have seen the wegzuschmeissen 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.850
 if then no liter here 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.600
 Then I give the rest 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.240
 with water and ice cubes stand out 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.220
 now I had enough in it 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.530
 after that I was still hungry and 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.780
 I ate some peanuts 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.280
 that has already satisfied me more 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.800
 then I was fine this afternoon 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.020
 I have then in this beautiful court 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.280
 ate and no that was a lie to me 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.200
 I did not eat it 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.900
 taken three forks was heartbroken 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.730
 when did it taste totally disgusting 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.350
 So no idea how they are in the photos 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.480
 but so yummy therefore you the 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.680
 Date down but I just could not 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.090
 food and then I just have 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.600
 eaten by lasso 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.470
 a banana eaten and a fourth 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.140
 honey melon now I am first 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.570
 okay so far as i am fed up though 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.250
 somehow dissatisfied and a little tired 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.020
 but that can be a bit tired 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.120
 but I also heard when you were with 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.390
 knows flour and sugar stops that one 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.470
 withdrawal symptoms is so 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.550
 headache fatigue and maybe 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.170
 is that already? 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.610
 although you do that after the first day of 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.280
 really should not sound like that yet 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.470
 or my second experiential report and 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.210
 the other diary that comes then murder 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.480
 then report tomorrow like mine 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.580
 dinner was and how I feel 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.870
 how they personalize it very 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.920
 unhappy and can I believe 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:59.460
 most unfortunate 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:59.460
 and we want everything beautiful
