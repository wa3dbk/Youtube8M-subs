can never find them that's actually a
really<00:00:13.650> good<00:00:13.830> question<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.360> talk

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
really good question because we talk

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.330 
really good question because we talk
about<00:00:15.660> poly<00:00:15.990> bags<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.440> lot<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.890> lot<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.160> times

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
about poly bags a lot a lot of times

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
about poly bags a lot a lot of times
there's<00:00:17.520> really<00:00:17.670> good<00:00:17.850> value<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.359> pal<00:00:18.660> poly

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
there's really good value in pal poly

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.950 
there's really good value in pal poly
bags<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.789> especially<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> minifigures

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
bags and especially for the minifigures

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
bags and especially for the minifigures
that<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.380> give<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> poly<00:00:22.920> bags<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.430> be

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that you can give the poly bags can be

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.420 
that you can give the poly bags can be
kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> tough<00:00:24.240> thing<00:00:24.740> because<00:00:25.740> typically

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
kind of a tough thing because typically

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.419 
kind of a tough thing because typically
when<00:00:26.760> they<00:00:26.880> come<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.769> lot<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.099> at<00:00:29.189> least<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
when they come a lot of them at least a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.669 
when they come a lot of them at least a
lot<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> good<00:00:29.910> ones<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.380> really

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
lot of the good ones like the really

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
lot of the good ones like the really
good<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.399> recently<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> one

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
good one right now recently is the one

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.479 
good one right now recently is the one
that<00:00:33.660> Steven<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.260> talked<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> Belle<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.980> our

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that Steven just talked to Belle and our

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
that Steven just talked to Belle and our
last<00:00:35.730> Brook<00:00:35.969> show<00:00:36.090> raw<00:00:36.270> video<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
last Brook show raw video the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
last Brook show raw video the
grandfather<00:00:37.649> clock<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.870> ghost

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
grandfather clock and you get the ghost

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
grandfather clock and you get the ghost
and<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.590> very<00:00:40.770> hard<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.219> those<00:00:41.370> ghosts

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and it's very hard to get those ghosts

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.869 
and it's very hard to get those ghosts
because<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.300> only<00:00:42.420> way<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.879> as

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
because the only way to get them is as

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
because the only way to get them is as
far<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.360> three<00:00:45.629> ways<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> haunted

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
far as I know three ways in the haunted

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.680 
far as I know three ways in the haunted
house<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
house you get one you get some in the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.650 
house you get one you get some in the
ghost<00:00:48.930> train<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
ghost train you also get some in this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.279 
ghost train you also get some in this
set<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.210> $15<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.140> can

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
set you get one but it's $15 and you can

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.119 
set you get one but it's $15 and you can
only<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> Lego<00:00:56.250> store<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.890> can

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
only get in the Lego store but you can

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
only get in the Lego store but you can
get<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> poly<00:00:59.820> bag<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:01.199> has<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> grandfather

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
get this poly bag that has a grandfather

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.799 
get this poly bag that has a grandfather
clock<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.760> ghost<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.539> five

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
clock and a ghost and it's only five

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.509 
clock and a ghost and it's only five
dollars<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.949> good<00:01:05.070> way<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> get

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
dollars so it's a really good way to get

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
dollars so it's a really good way to get
that<00:01:05.580> ghost<00:01:06.030> me<00:01:06.270> figure<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.470> how<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.770> find

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that ghost me figure so how do you find

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.469 
that ghost me figure so how do you find
them<00:01:10.130> typically<00:01:11.130> they're<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.430> over<00:01:11.790> uh<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
them typically they're all over uh I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
them typically they're all over uh I
know<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:12.960> fine<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> answer<00:01:13.619> you're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
know that's fine not the answer you're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.480 
know that's fine not the answer you're
looking<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.600> but<00:01:15.920> for<00:01:16.920> instance<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
looking for but for instance this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.330 
looking for but for instance this
grandfather<00:01:18.030> clock<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.100> saw<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
grandfather clock one I saw it and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
grandfather clock one I saw it and
Target<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.630> seen<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> anywhere<00:01:22.380> else

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
Target I have not seen it anywhere else

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.140 
Target I have not seen it anywhere else
I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.770> Steven<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.549> his<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.869> Toys<00:01:25.200> R<00:01:25.350> Us<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
I think Steven got his at Toys R Us and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.640 
I think Steven got his at Toys R Us and
typically<00:01:27.150> poly<00:01:27.390> bags<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
typically poly bags are just a lot of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.550 
typically poly bags are just a lot of
times<00:01:28.829> they're<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.009> quickly<00:01:29.640> released

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
times they're just quickly released

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
times they're just quickly released
usually<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> specific<00:01:32.700> event<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:35.119> season

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
usually for a specific event or season

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.550 
usually for a specific event or season
usually<00:01:36.360> they're<00:01:36.659> seasonal<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
usually they're seasonal so like the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
usually they're seasonal so like the
grandfather<00:01:37.950> clock<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.490> you'll<00:01:39.150> probably

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
grandfather clock one you'll probably

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.280 
grandfather clock one you'll probably
see<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.020> until<00:01:41.180> Col<00:01:42.180> oween<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.049> apply

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
see it up until Col oween and then apply

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
see it up until Col oween and then apply
disappear<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.049> it's<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.439> cool<00:01:46.970> but

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
disappear so it's not really cool but

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.429 
disappear so it's not really cool but
that's<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.659> goes<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.049> kind<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that's the way it goes they kind of just

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
that's the way it goes they kind of just
just<00:01:49.770> throw<00:01:50.070> them<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> don't<00:01:50.640> think

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
just throw them out I don't think

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
just throw them out I don't think
there's<00:01:51.000> many<00:01:51.299> production<00:01:52.079> runs<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.500> these

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
there's many production runs of these

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
there's many production runs of these
