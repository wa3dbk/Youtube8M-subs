gently buff it note that the wood has

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.760 
gently buff it note that the wood has
already<00:01:22.360> been<00:01:22.540> sealed<00:01:22.840> with<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.410> wood<00:01:23.619> and

already been sealed with the wood and
plaster<00:01:24.190> sealer<00:01:24.550> so<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.119> surface<00:01:25.479> itself<00:01:25.810> is
