they<00:00:00.179> obviously<00:00:00.299> the<00:00:00.659> molds<00:00:01.230> you<00:00:01.469> can<00:00:02.310> cut

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
they obviously the molds you can cut

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.180 
they obviously the molds you can cut
these<00:00:02.669> up<00:00:02.850> so<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.600> more<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:04.080> one<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.740> these

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
these up so the more on one of the these

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.800 
these up so the more on one of the these
you<00:00:05.580> all<00:00:05.700> see<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> better<00:00:06.180> value<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.750> money

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
you all see the better value for money

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.960 
you all see the better value for money
and<00:00:07.259> billions<00:00:07.890> silicon<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.519> completely

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
and billions silicon is completely

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.000 
and billions silicon is completely
indestructible<00:00:09.300> yes<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> silicon's

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
indestructible yes that the silicon's

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.890 
indestructible yes that the silicon's
bond<00:00:11.160> opaque<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:12.000> I've<00:00:12.120> helped<00:00:12.540> them<00:00:12.690> so

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
bond opaque because I've helped them so

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.509 
bond opaque because I've helped them so
you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.170> handle<00:00:13.590> them<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:14.160> when<00:00:14.309> they're

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
you can handle them but when they're

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.160 
you can handle them but when they're
through<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.240> obviously<00:00:15.389> go<00:00:15.719> completely

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
through they obviously go completely

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.590 
through they obviously go completely
clear<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.520> continuity<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.420> see

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
clear so for continuity you can see

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
clear so for continuity you can see
exactly<00:00:18.810> where<00:00:19.109> you're<00:00:19.260> putting<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
exactly where you're putting them so

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.019 
exactly where you're putting them so
it's<00:00:20.220> ideal<00:00:20.779> they're<00:00:21.779> indestructible<00:00:23.029> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's ideal they're indestructible so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.580 
it's ideal they're indestructible so
unless<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:24.750> cut<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> wrong<00:00:25.529> way

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
unless you actually cut it the wrong way

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.220 
unless you actually cut it the wrong way
or<00:00:25.800> lose<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.670> winning<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.240> life<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
or lose it it's winning for life so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
or lose it it's winning for life so
that's<00:00:28.650> how<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.490> once<00:00:29.760> you're

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that's how they start at once you're

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's how they start at once you're
ready<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.330> use<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.710> thing<00:00:31.920> you've

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
ready to use them the one thing you've

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
ready to use them the one thing you've
got<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.399> careful<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.360> obviously<00:00:33.750> not

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
got to be careful about is obviously not

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
got to be careful about is obviously not
letting<00:00:34.230> dust<00:00:34.500> fall<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> ones<00:00:35.309> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
letting dust fall on the ones that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
letting dust fall on the ones that
already<00:00:35.640> done<00:00:35.969> hence<00:00:36.360> why<00:00:36.739> containment

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
already done hence why containment

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
already done hence why containment
lightness<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.370> quite<00:00:38.579> useful<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.360> initially

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
lightness and quite useful but initially

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.400 
lightness and quite useful but initially
what<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.719> paint<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.930> scene<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
what you do is you paint a scene a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
what you do is you paint a scene a
release<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.460> also<00:00:44.700> acts<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> seal

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
release on it which also acts as a seal

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.330 
release on it which also acts as a seal
except<00:00:45.989> I've<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.320> picked<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> dirty<00:00:46.980> brush

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
except I've just picked up a dirty brush

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.630 
except I've just picked up a dirty brush
it's<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.510> trim<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:49.430> don't<00:00:50.430> do

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it's going to just trim it out don't do

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
it's going to just trim it out don't do
as<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.210> make<00:00:51.629> sure<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.960> brushes<00:00:52.320> are

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
as I do so make sure your brushes are

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260 
as I do so make sure your brushes are
clean<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.760> little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
clean you then take a little bit of a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
clean you then take a little bit of a
sealer<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.410> awful<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
sealer you don't need an awful lot and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.709 
sealer you don't need an awful lot and
you<00:00:56.579> literally<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.239> coat<00:00:57.649> over<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> area

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
you literally just coat over the area

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.380 
you literally just coat over the area
okay<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
okay and you need that for about a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.780 
okay and you need that for about a
minute<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> couple<00:01:04.949> minutes<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.549> dry

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
minute it's a couple minutes just to dry

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.060 
minute it's a couple minutes just to dry
the<00:01:06.360> instructions<00:01:07.049> say<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:07.590> another<00:01:07.830> layer

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the instructions say put another layer

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.800 
the instructions say put another layer
on<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.670> honest<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.600> always

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
on but to be honest it's not always

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.289 
on but to be honest it's not always
necessary<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.310> deep<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.850> might<00:01:12.119> have

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
necessary if it's very deep I might have

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
necessary if it's very deep I might have
another<00:01:12.479> layer<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.619> something

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
another layer on but with something

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.330 
another layer on but with something
quite<00:01:14.130> shallow<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.909> wouldn't<00:01:15.600> worry<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.340> lids

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
quite shallow I wouldn't worry so lids

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.310 
quite shallow I wouldn't worry so lids
on<00:01:17.520> everything<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.600> are<00:01:18.630> four<00:01:18.900> tones

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
on everything now there are four tones

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
on everything now there are four tones
of<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:19.830> colors<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.880> find<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> most<00:01:21.990> useless

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of these colors I find the most useless

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.520 
of these colors I find the most useless
this<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> pinky<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.640> only<00:01:24.420> because<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
this one the pinky one only because you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
this one the pinky one only because you
can<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.830> much<00:01:26.070> easier<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.430> darken<00:01:26.939> something

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
can it's much easier to darken something

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
can it's much easier to darken something
out<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:27.930> something<00:01:28.350> look<00:01:28.439> lighter<00:01:28.710> but

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
out and make something look lighter but

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.830 
out and make something look lighter but
you've<00:01:29.579> obviously<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:30.000> olive<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> they've

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you've obviously got olive and they've

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.140 
you've obviously got olive and they've
also<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> dark<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.909> dark

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
also got a dark one for really dark

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.560 
also got a dark one for really dark
skins<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> gay<00:01:35.070> too<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.700> tend<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> talk<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> skin

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
skins so gay too I tend to talk to skin

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
skins so gay too I tend to talk to skin
tones<00:01:36.810> 1281<00:01:37.560> being<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.280> white<00:01:38.549> aight

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
tones 1281 being we really white aight

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.580 
tones 1281 being we really white aight
being<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.540> black<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.439> you've<00:01:40.560> got

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
being really black and then you've got

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
being really black and then you've got
others<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.070> between<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.270> sort<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
others in between so it's sort of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.940 
others in between so it's sort of
covering<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> different<00:01:43.530> ones<00:01:43.680> he's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
covering all the different ones he's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.319 
covering all the different ones he's
done<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.700> ready<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
done it when you're ready to use it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
done it when you're ready to use it
you're<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> across<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> coffee<00:01:47.220> or<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:50.280> orange

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you're a across the coffee or the orange

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.929 
you're a across the coffee or the orange
stick<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.490> write<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
stick and then you just write what I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789 
stick and then you just write what I
tend<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.810> quite<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
tend to do is put quite a bit on and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.679 
tend to do is put quite a bit on and
find<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> nooks<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> crannies<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.479> piece

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
find the nooks and crannies of the piece

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.459 
find the nooks and crannies of the piece
initially<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.250> majority<00:01:59.399> is<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
initially so the majority is on but I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.280 
initially so the majority is on but I
leave<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> mound<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> top<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> sort

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
leave a mound at the top there so I sort

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.340 
leave a mound at the top there so I sort
of<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> coating<00:02:05.280> yes<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.210> pretty<00:02:06.630> no

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of got it coating yes it was pretty no

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.910 
of got it coating yes it was pretty no
it's<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:09.330> similar<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it's not it's similar but this is a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's not it's similar but this is a
gentleman<00:02:11.400> who's<00:02:11.849> made<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:12.690> his

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
gentleman who's made it and it's his

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.760 
gentleman who's made it and it's his
special<00:02:13.349> recipe<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.670> similar<00:02:15.000> yeah

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
special recipe but it is similar yeah

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.680 
special recipe but it is similar yeah
just<00:02:16.770> take<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.220> lower<00:02:17.370> edge<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.910> card<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
just take the lower edge of a card and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.770 
just take the lower edge of a card and
they're<00:02:19.620> nice<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.010> flexi<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:21.420> literally

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
they're nice and flexi and you literally

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.040 
they're nice and flexi and you literally
just<00:02:22.080> take<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.620> slowly<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:24.360> come<00:02:24.569> across<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
just take it slowly just come across the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.559 
just take it slowly just come across the
top<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.800> haven't<00:02:29.099> succeeded<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:30.090> doing<00:02:30.239> in

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
top if you haven't succeeded in doing in

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.259 
top if you haven't succeeded in doing in
one<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:31.800> not<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> problem<00:02:32.519> because<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.940> mean<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
one it's not a problem because I mean I

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.390 
one it's not a problem because I mean I
have<00:02:33.480> there<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.050> hadn't<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.099> can<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
have there but if I hadn't you can just

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.240 
have there but if I hadn't you can just
go<00:02:35.580> back<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.569> not<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.680> gelatin<00:02:38.160> or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
go back in it's not like so gelatin or

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.680 
go back in it's not like so gelatin or
somehow<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.580> which<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:39.180> could<00:02:39.360> only<00:02:39.510> do

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
somehow that which you could only do

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.570 
somehow that which you could only do
once<00:02:39.959> with<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.319> seated<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.340> come

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
once with it seated so you just come

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.660 
once with it seated so you just come
down<00:02:41.819> again<00:02:42.000> yes<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.620> then<00:02:44.129> hope<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.550> you've

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
down again yes and then hope that you've

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.369 
down again yes and then hope that you've
got<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.330> that's<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.019> can<00:02:46.260> be

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
got it now that's right that can be

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.190 
got it now that's right that can be
that's<00:02:46.680> ready<00:02:46.980> dry<00:02:47.700> now<00:02:48.060> ok<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:48.959> leave

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that's ready dry now ok so I just leave

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190 
that's ready dry now ok so I just leave
it<00:02:49.790> probably<00:02:50.790> actually<00:02:51.269> here<00:02:51.750> they're<00:02:51.989> drying

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
it probably actually here they're drying

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.509 
it probably actually here they're drying
quite<00:02:52.470> quickly<00:02:52.739> but<00:02:53.040> i<00:02:53.069> would<00:02:53.250> say<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> good

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
quite quickly but i would say a good

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.270 
quite quickly but i would say a good
hour<00:02:53.849> possibly<00:02:54.510> two<00:02:54.959> big<00:02:55.440> ones<00:02:55.680> might<00:02:56.069> need

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
hour possibly two big ones might need

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.800 
hour possibly two big ones might need
longer<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.910> be<00:02:57.000> honest<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.300> lot<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.569> these<00:02:57.629> i

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
longer to be honest a lot of these i

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.050 
longer to be honest a lot of these i
just<00:02:57.989> leave<00:02:58.140> overnight<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.550> do<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.760> night

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
just leave overnight so you do the night

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.699 
just leave overnight so you do the night
before<00:03:00.239> prep<00:03:00.780> them<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.050> night<00:03:01.170> before<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
before prep them the night before and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.710 
before prep them the night before and
then<00:03:02.040> they're<00:03:02.190> ready<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.519> next<00:03:02.640> morning<00:03:03.180> so

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
then they're ready the next morning so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.890 
then they're ready the next morning so
don't<00:03:03.989> ever<00:03:04.800> throw<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.280> excess<00:03:05.670> off

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
don't ever throw the excess off

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.030 
don't ever throw the excess off
computers<00:03:06.900> you'd<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.170> surprised<00:03:07.590> how<00:03:07.739> much

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
computers you'd be surprised how much

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 
computers you'd be surprised how much
you<00:03:08.400> get<00:03:08.550> out<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:08.940> jar<00:03:09.209> jar's<00:03:09.870> don't<00:03:10.110> look

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
you get out of a jar jar's don't look

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.229 
you get out of a jar jar's don't look
very<00:03:10.260> big<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.860> I've<00:03:11.040> used<00:03:11.400> well<00:03:11.879> I've<00:03:12.000> made

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
very big but I've used well I've made

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.750 
very big but I've used well I've made
quite<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.170> lot<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.709> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.920> be<00:03:14.010> 50<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.370> 60

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
quite a lot it's going to be 50 or 60

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.399 
quite a lot it's going to be 50 or 60
here<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.120> still<00:03:15.180> had<00:03:15.599> some<00:03:15.780> left<00:03:15.840> down<00:03:16.260> at

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
here and I still had some left down at

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.170 
here and I still had some left down at
the<00:03:16.470> bottom<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.370> quite<00:03:17.550> economic

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the bottom so it's quite economic

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.670 
the bottom so it's quite economic
because<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.599> see<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> lot<00:03:18.930> goes<00:03:19.170> back<00:03:19.440> in

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
because you can see a lot goes back in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.509 
because you can see a lot goes back in
so<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:20.640> how<00:03:20.819> its<00:03:21.090> star<00:03:21.360> then<00:03:21.810> n<00:03:22.200> drive<00:03:22.590> like

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
so that's how its star then n drive like

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.180 
so that's how its star then n drive like
one<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> these<00:03:24.349> so<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> equivalent<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.010> that

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
one of these so the equivalent of that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.500 
one of these so the equivalent of that
would<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.610> something<00:03:26.909> now<00:03:27.209> I've<00:03:27.330> actually

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
would be something now I've actually

that's<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.530> mole<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:57.220> look<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.150> see<00:05:58.390> where<00:05:59.080> what

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
that's the mole I look to see where what

that's the mole I look to see where what
what<00:05:59.830> where<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.130> shape<00:06:00.550> is<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.180> then<00:06:01.750> coming

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
what where the shape is and then coming

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.690 
what where the shape is and then coming
around<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.590> edge<00:06:02.710> of<00:06:02.890> a<00:06:03.070> bit<00:06:03.250> so<00:06:03.430> that<00:06:03.460> you

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
around the edge of a bit so that you

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.420 
around the edge of a bit so that you
start<00:06:03.970> to<00:06:04.210> see<00:06:04.480> the<00:06:04.690> shade<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.860> then<00:06:06.100> you<00:06:06.250> can

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
start to see the shade and then you can

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.040 
start to see the shade and then you can
come<00:06:06.610> in<00:06:06.730> with<00:06:06.820> more<00:06:07.030> blogs<00:06:07.360> recent<00:06:07.930> one<00:06:08.020> was

what's<00:06:08.560> quite<00:06:08.860> good<00:06:09.160> is<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:09.910> can

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
what's quite good is that you can

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.730 
what's quite good is that you can
actually<00:06:10.210> put<00:06:10.630> more<00:06:10.810> blood<00:06:11.080> further<00:06:11.410> down

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
actually put more blood further down

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.530 
actually put more blood further down
it's<00:06:12.040> quite<00:06:12.280> nice<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:12.670> keep<00:06:12.850> it<00:06:12.970> off<00:06:13.090> at<00:06:13.390> the

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
it's quite nice to keep it off at the

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.570 
it's quite nice to keep it off at the
little<00:06:13.780> edge<00:06:13.930> so<00:06:14.440> this<00:06:14.590> is<00:06:14.740> like<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:14.920> sort<00:06:15.460> of<00:06:15.490> a

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
little edge so this is like a sort of a

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.910 
little edge so this is like a sort of a
very<00:06:15.880> superficial<00:06:17.400> little<00:06:18.400> part<00:06:18.670> really

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
very superficial little part really

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:29.060 
very superficial little part really
that's<00:06:20.920> appealing<00:06:22.200> I've<00:06:23.200> been<00:06:23.680> full

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.250 

you<00:06:29.580> can<00:06:29.730> just<00:06:29.880> add<00:06:30.120> or<00:06:30.450> take<00:06:30.480> away<00:06:30.690> according

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
you can just add or take away according

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.730 
you can just add or take away according
to<00:06:31.440> where<00:06:31.650> you<00:06:31.830> want

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:43.730 

right

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.650 

I<00:06:43.800> mean<00:06:44.430> obviously<00:06:44.550> it<00:06:44.819> will<00:06:44.880> drip<00:06:45.180> blood<00:06:45.330> but

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
I mean obviously it will drip blood but

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.659 
I mean obviously it will drip blood but
