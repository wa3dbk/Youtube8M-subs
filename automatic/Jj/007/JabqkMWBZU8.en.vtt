00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
put that into that so that's the game
audio<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.210> what<00:02:06.329> connects<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
audio not so what connects it to the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.229 
audio not so what connects it to the
headset<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:08.670> powers<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
headset and then this is what powers the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.559 
headset and then this is what powers the
headset<00:02:09.660> because<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> USB<00:02:11.569> power

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
headset because it is a USB power
