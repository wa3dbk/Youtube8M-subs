00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello after seeing those who are i 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.580
 characteristic of this program that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.810
 will study autonomy 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.320
 let's see what the functions are 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.490
 specifications for specific functions 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.349
 precisely where to give a series of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.440
 key combinations these functions 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 specifications allow us to isolate 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 select even more 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.240
 let's say the part he's a we are 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.130
 interested in studying to do this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 point there are these three combinations of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 keys that only against more clicks senis lo 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.949
 shift plus left click functions more 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.000
 more than sinister 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.800
 let's take the case that we want them 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 study for example morning from 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.329
 organs in a particular way we want 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.850
 study for example the part on 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.440
 respiratory that they challenge me 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.030
 precisely a part of the respiratory system which 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 what we can do we can select 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 what interests us and therefore 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 we can in the same way eliminate the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.039
 parties that we are not interested in the first 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.660
 combination of keys and against the most 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.239
 click and left against more clicks 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.559
 left allows us to select 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.969
 only what allows us to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.949
 eliminate what we don't want to see 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.809
 for example I don't want to see that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.520
 choke i want to see the liver 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.890
 I want to see the stomach I don't want 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.570
 see the friend 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.950
 so this podium on able to 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.290
 select the one that has note 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.300
 I want to get rid of playouts 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.780
 I want to get rid of the lungs and it remains 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.060
 this fact that what should I do 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.619
 once this is done I am 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.600
 able to use the second 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.820
 key combination to select the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.340
 parts that interests me so you can 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.830
 select more eg doing 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.840
 precisely the shift plus left click 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.900
 I could select for example the caterpillars 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.369
 to be able to select the bronchial tree 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.050
 and I could select thousand dragons ha 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.860
 so these three appear to me 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.660
 components 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.320
 once closed , that too remains 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:47.180
 which interests me I press the button 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.970
 function basically we say any 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.649
 organ that we can see in this 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.539
 world what happens this way me 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.360
 practical intel isolation of what 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.660
 I selected then we say that these 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.310
 are the main features 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.740
 in fact the program can be 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 appear even if I am interested in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.830
 successive levels 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.200
 here is so there are almost three 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.180
 main functions against more than yes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.880
 all left to eliminate what 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.340
 does not affect shift more click and left 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.870
 to go and put the plate is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 made to therefore also include the name 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.600
 as i'm studying and then i can do 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.040
 finally it has function 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.150
 more left clicks worth going 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.730
 precisely it would have been selected by clicking 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.100
 precisely shift ii which left putting 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.960
 the plate then what are the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.790
 main functions 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.030
 another main function we have 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.370
 said is that of the other one says that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.310
 you can't keep the search bar 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.740
 I'm going to write a topic for example 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.420
 as can be quite certain indeed 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.860
 almone and live there lung 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.110
 also in this case it is always valid 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.330
 same speech opposite to select 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.230
 in this way by doing counter click e 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.860
 left 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.240
 so these are precisely the functions 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.220
 fundamental to remember that there 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.500
 allow you to highlight even more 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.630
 the parts of interest therefore also 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.830
 because they are alive, I hope there is 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.330
 was useful as always if precisely the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.490
 you enjoyed putting me like it 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.650
 share it with double video as it seems 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.860
 because it can be very useful to everyone 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.200
 how many consider atoms and if indeed 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.730
 not single written sign up because 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.820
 I will also make other very useful videos 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.960
 then you will immediately receive notifications 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.760
 visit my channel because they will be there 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.560
 so much information for the link of this 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.650
 program I put you precisely 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.020
 in description everything to do i 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.440
 test and then I look clean and 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.440
 Hello
