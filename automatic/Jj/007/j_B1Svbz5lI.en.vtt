hit<00:00:15.210> 50<00:00:15.480> feet<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.020> revise<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.590> version<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.279> a

hit 50 feet we revise this version of a
little<00:00:17.640> bit<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.140> we're<00:00:19.320> getting<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
little bit and we think we're getting a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.769 
little bit and we think we're getting a
few<00:00:19.740> few<00:00:20.010> more<00:00:20.160> feet<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.390> attempted

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
few few more feet out of it we attempted

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.210 
few few more feet out of it we attempted
to<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> metal<00:00:22.320> variant<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.039> metal

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
to make a metal variant there are metal

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.450 
to make a metal variant there are metal
barreled<00:00:23.640> copy<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.359> device<00:00:24.840> and

barreled copy of this device and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.560 
barreled copy of this device and
honestly<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> metal<00:00:26.880> barrel<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.390> not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
honestly the metal barrel was not

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.089 
honestly the metal barrel was not
working<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.019> good<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.439> printed<00:00:28.830> barrel

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
working as good as our printed barrel

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
working as good as our printed barrel
well<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.240> investigating<00:00:30.900> why

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
well we're going to be investigating why

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.889 
well we're going to be investigating why
that<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.349> exactly<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> scenario<00:00:32.899> going

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
that is exactly in this scenario going

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.060 
that is exactly in this scenario going
further<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
further but for now we're just going to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.350 
further but for now we're just going to
showing<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> range<00:00:35.670> test<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
showing you the range test of the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
showing you the range test of the
completely<00:00:36.780> printed<00:00:37.200> piece<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> our

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
completely printed piece which in our

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580 
completely printed piece which in our
experience<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.910> works<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> best<00:00:39.590> what's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
experience it works the best what's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
experience it works the best what's
going<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.850> tape<00:00:42.030> measure<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.390> garden

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
going on the tape measure in the garden

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
going on the tape measure in the garden
out<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:42.899> starts<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.649> 40<00:00:43.950> feet<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> extends

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
out there starts at 40 feet and extends

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.630 
out there starts at 40 feet and extends
out<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.629> 65<00:00:46.200> feet<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.280> edge<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
out to 65 feet the very edge of the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
out to 65 feet the very edge of the
garden<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> cliff<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:49.350> 70

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
garden in cliff there is actually 70

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.770 
garden in cliff there is actually 70
feet<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.969> any<00:00:51.120> darts<00:00:51.300> fly<00:00:51.629> over

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
feet so if you see any darts fly over

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
feet so if you see any darts fly over
the<00:00:51.870> edge<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.199> they're<00:00:53.010> gone<00:00:53.190> forever<00:00:53.370> and

the edge there they're gone forever and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
the edge there they're gone forever and
they've<00:00:54.059> hit<00:00:54.239> 70<00:00:54.600> feet<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.829> the

free come on to the range study here now

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.210 
free come on to the range study here now
I<00:01:21.540> hit<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> very<00:01:22.110> edge<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> garden<00:01:22.920> within

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I hit the very edge of the garden within

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:40.300 
I hit the very edge of the garden within
like<00:01:23.310> 65<00:01:23.850> feet

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:52.370 

all<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:42.390> fire<00:01:42.630> let's<00:01:43.440> walk<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
all right this fire let's walk it out so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
all right this fire let's walk it out so
as<00:01:52.440> I<00:01:52.560> mentioned<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.009> tape<00:01:53.190> measure<00:01:53.369> starts

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
as I mentioned the tape measure starts

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.990 
as I mentioned the tape measure starts
at<00:01:53.850> 40<00:01:54.150> feet<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.280> bad<00:01:56.460> fire<00:01:56.729> here

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
at 40 feet that kind of a bad fire here

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.109 
at 40 feet that kind of a bad fire here
it<00:01:57.090> looks<00:01:57.210> about<00:01:57.360> 38<00:01:57.780> feet<00:01:58.430> another<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.580> at<00:01:59.700> 42

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
it looks about 38 feet another one at 42

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.470 
it looks about 38 feet another one at 42
feet

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.210 

and<00:02:05.200> if<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.500> move<00:02:05.710> out<00:02:05.920> here<00:02:07.650> these<00:02:08.650> last<00:02:08.890> two

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
and if you move out here these last two

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.020 
and if you move out here these last two
are<00:02:10.060> literally<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.540> 65<00:02:11.200> feet<00:02:11.500> they<00:02:12.340> almost<00:02:12.670> went
