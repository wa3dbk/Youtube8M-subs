the<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:04.310> actual<00:04:05.310> fighting<00:04:05.700> Asst<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.209> very

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
the the actual fighting Asst is very

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.770 
the the actual fighting Asst is very
simple<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.670> easy<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.940> understand<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:09.750> that

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
simple and easy to understand so that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.729 
simple and easy to understand so that
the<00:04:10.470> money<00:04:10.650> men<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.099> focus<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.730> money

the money men can focus on the money

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.660 
the money men can focus on the money
basically<00:04:13.739> how<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:13.980> works<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.400> take<00:04:14.640> a

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
basically how it works is you take a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.930 
basically how it works is you take a
unit<00:04:15.120> when<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.959> choose<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> maneuver<00:04:16.940> thing

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
unit when you choose the maneuver thing

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.050 
unit when you choose the maneuver thing
you<00:04:18.419> can<00:04:18.889> take<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.340> move<00:04:20.549> all<00:04:20.669> your<00:04:20.789> units

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
you can take you can move all your units

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.700 
you can take you can move all your units
one<00:04:21.180> space<00:04:21.419> they<00:04:21.930> go<00:04:22.079> into<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.289> space<00:04:22.500> of

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
one space they go into a space of

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.810 
one space they go into a space of
another<00:04:22.919> country<00:04:23.250> if<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.430> want<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.669> shoot

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
another country if you want to shoot

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.540 
another country if you want to shoot
them<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.000> do<00:04:24.210> one<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.350> one<00:04:25.530> always<00:04:25.919> one<00:04:26.310> for

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
them you do one for one always one for

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.279 
them you do one for one always one for
one<00:04:26.699> so<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.240> kill<00:04:27.510> one<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.720> their<00:04:27.900> guys<00:04:28.050> that

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
one so you kill one of their guys that

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.050 
one so you kill one of their guys that
they<00:04:28.440> kill<00:04:28.650> one<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.800> your<00:04:28.949> guys<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.400> that's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
they kill one of your guys and that's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.129 
they kill one of your guys and that's
how<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.660> works<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.410> have<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> majority<00:04:32.340> of

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
how it works if you have the majority of

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.990 
how it works if you have the majority of
say<00:04:34.139> these<00:04:34.320> guys<00:04:34.350> both<00:04:34.740> going<00:04:34.979> here<00:04:35.220> they<00:04:35.820> blow

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
say these guys both going here they blow

is<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.380> investment<00:04:49.830> see<00:04:50.580> each<00:04:50.940> player<00:04:51.419> is

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
is the investment see each player is

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.290 
is the investment see each player is

these videos however I picked up this
game<00:05:37.470> because<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.190> idea<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:39.380> puppetry<00:05:40.380> is

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
game because the idea of puppetry is

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
way that through play you sort of

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.460 
way that through play you sort of
abstract<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.169> out<00:05:58.349> of<00:05:58.500> your<00:05:58.650> mind<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:59.099> have
