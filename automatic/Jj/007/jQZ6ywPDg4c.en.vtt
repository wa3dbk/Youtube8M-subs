00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
extra days but it wasn't a huge deal

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.510 
extra days but it wasn't a huge deal
because<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:04.390> still<00:03:04.630> had<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.040> build<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> kit<00:03:06.370> and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
because I still had to build the kit and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.070 
because I still had to build the kit and
it<00:03:06.610> was<00:03:06.700> still<00:03:06.880> not<00:03:07.300> even<00:03:07.450> halfway<00:03:07.780> but

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
it was still not even halfway but

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.050 
it was still not even halfway but
through<00:03:08.620> when<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:08.920> hope<00:03:09.370> they<00:03:09.460> finally<00:03:09.760> send<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
through when I hope they finally send it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.260 
through when I hope they finally send it
to<00:03:10.180> me<00:03:10.300> so<00:03:10.450> um<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:12.070> fit<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.460> not<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.910> greatest

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
to me so um the fit was not the greatest

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.640 
to me so um the fit was not the greatest
I<00:03:13.390> had<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.600> do<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> couple<00:03:13.900> little<00:03:14.200> tricks<00:03:14.350> here

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
I had to do a couple little tricks here

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.590 
I had to do a couple little tricks here
and<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:15.000> sanding<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.120> all<00:03:16.210> that<00:03:16.330> stuff<00:03:16.480> to

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
and it's sanding and all that stuff to

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.750 
and it's sanding and all that stuff to
get<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> look<00:03:17.230> good<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.590> fit<00:03:17.800> good<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.520> I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
get it to look good and fit good and I

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.340 
get it to look good and fit good and I
would<00:03:18.940> still<00:03:19.120> wish<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.390> what<00:03:19.870> if<00:03:19.960> it's<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.170> a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
would still wish it what if it's just a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.570 
would still wish it what if it's just a
little<00:03:20.590> bit<00:03:20.680> better<00:03:20.860> but<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> still<00:03:21.250> looks

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
little bit better but it still looks

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.310 
little bit better but it still looks
really<00:03:21.640> cool<00:03:22.060> um<00:03:23.340> enough<00:03:24.340> you'll<00:03:24.460> remember

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
really cool um enough you'll remember

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.080 
really cool um enough you'll remember
from<00:03:26.320> my<00:03:26.530> part<00:03:27.010> one<00:03:27.160> video<00:03:27.460> I<00:03:27.550> was<00:03:27.760> gonna<00:03:27.880> do

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
from my part one video I was gonna do

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.430 
from my part one video I was gonna do
this<00:03:28.240> in<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.420> worn<00:03:28.660> white<00:03:28.870> finish<00:03:29.230> well

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
this in a worn white finish well

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.910 
this in a worn white finish well
obviously<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.150> not<00:03:31.330> one<00:03:31.660> way<00:03:31.870> now<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.650> used

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
obviously this is not one way now I used

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.430 
obviously this is not one way now I used
to<00:03:33.150> tried<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.330> use<00:03:34.480> rather<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.840> wood<00:03:35.260> tone

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
to tried to use rather a wood tone

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.410 
to tried to use rather a wood tone
finishing<00:03:35.920> kit<00:03:36.160> now<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> had<00:03:36.730> used<00:03:36.940> one<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.120> my

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
finishing kit now I had used one on my

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.340 
finishing kit now I had used one on my
previous<00:03:37.630> build<00:03:39.210> with<00:03:40.210> great<00:03:40.450> success<00:03:41.140> but

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
previous build with great success but

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.650 
previous build with great success but
this<00:03:41.500> time<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.710> didn't<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.100> much<00:03:42.250> success

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
this time I didn't have much success

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.390 
this time I didn't have much success
mainly<00:03:43.660> because<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.650> sanding<00:03:45.040> sealer

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
mainly because the sanding sealer

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.450 
mainly because the sanding sealer
now<00:03:46.230> what<00:03:47.230> would<00:03:47.680> tone<00:03:47.860> says<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.310> know<00:03:48.400> you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
now what would tone says you know you

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.890 
now what would tone says you know you
don't<00:03:48.670> want<00:03:48.880> anything<00:03:49.060> sealer<00:03:49.570> because<00:03:49.780> it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
don't want anything sealer because it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.830 
don't want anything sealer because it
will<00:03:49.990> react<00:03:50.380> bad<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.710> your<00:03:50.770> guitar<00:03:51.210> and<00:03:52.210> my

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
will react bad to your guitar and my

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.260 
will react bad to your guitar and my
last<00:03:53.050> kid<00:03:53.260> had<00:03:53.470> sealer<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:54.070> sanded<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.730> off<00:03:54.910> and

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
last kid had sealer I sanded it off and

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.110 
last kid had sealer I sanded it off and
had<00:03:56.050> no<00:03:56.200> problem<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:56.770> one<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.220> guess<00:03:57.970> they

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
had no problem this one I guess they

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.610 
had no problem this one I guess they
used<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.540> different<00:03:58.690> kind<00:03:58.990> of<00:03:59.020> sealer<00:03:59.350> I'm<00:03:59.440> sure

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
used a different kind of sealer I'm sure

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.500 
used a different kind of sealer I'm sure
these<00:03:59.830> imported<00:04:00.280> kits<00:04:00.580> come<00:04:00.790> from<00:04:01.000> different

these imported kits come from different

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.860 
these imported kits come from different
factories<00:04:02.020> but<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.740> one<00:04:02.950> had<00:04:03.600> an<00:04:04.600> enormous

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
factories but this one had an enormous

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.510 
factories but this one had an enormous
amount<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.380> sealer<00:04:05.770> on<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:06.310> just

amount of sealer on it and I just

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.400 
amount of sealer on it and I just

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
apparently couldn't get it off even as

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.780 
apparently couldn't get it off even as
much<00:04:08.590> as<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:08.800> saying<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.190> but<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.460> know<00:04:09.580> what

they<00:06:05.770> were<00:06:05.830> just<00:06:06.099> a<00:06:06.189> disaster<00:06:06.520> they<00:06:06.909> were<00:06:06.969> all

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
they were just a disaster they were all

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.959 
they were just a disaster they were all
Winkie<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:08.110> all<00:06:08.289> that<00:06:08.469> stuff<00:06:08.740> when<00:06:09.639> I<00:06:09.669> first

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
Winkie and all that stuff when I first

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.579 
Winkie and all that stuff when I first
put<00:06:10.180> them<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.479> so<00:06:10.659> I<00:06:10.689> had<00:06:10.839> to<00:06:10.930> try<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.080> fix<00:06:11.349> them

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
put them in so I had to try to fix them

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.670 
put them in so I had to try to fix them
and<00:06:11.879> Olin<00:06:12.879> could<00:06:13.029> not<00:06:13.270> fix<00:06:13.659> one<00:06:14.020> completely

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
and Olin could not fix one completely

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.139 
and Olin could not fix one completely
because<00:06:15.129> of<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.460> placement<00:06:15.879> of<00:06:15.909> the<00:06:16.029> other

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149 
because of the placement of the other

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.450 
because of the placement of the other
holes<00:06:16.409> so<00:06:17.409> I<00:06:17.439> couldn't<00:06:17.740> straighten<00:06:18.039> it<00:06:18.219> out<00:06:18.279> to

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
holes so I couldn't straighten it out to

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.429 
holes so I couldn't straighten it out to
make<00:06:18.580> it<00:06:18.639> even<00:06:19.270> with<00:06:19.389> this<00:06:19.569> side<00:06:19.779> but<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:20.349> know

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:20.439 
make it even with this side but you know

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:24.329 
make it even with this side but you know
what<00:06:20.680> actually<00:06:21.399> is<00:06:21.490> this<00:06:21.669> side<00:06:23.069> it<00:06:24.069> still

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:24.339 
what actually is this side it still

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.740 
what actually is this side it still
looks<00:06:24.490> great<00:06:24.639> I<00:06:24.879> know<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.089> kind<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.360> filled<00:06:25.599> that

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
looks great I know I kind of filled that

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.420 
looks great I know I kind of filled that
but<00:06:25.990> it<00:06:26.169> was<00:06:26.289> after<00:06:26.560> I'd<00:06:26.649> already<00:06:26.680> finished

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
but it was after I'd already finished

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.709 
but it was after I'd already finished
the<00:06:27.490> guitar<00:06:27.759> I<00:06:27.789> didn't<00:06:28.029> want<00:06:28.149> any<00:06:28.300> kind<00:06:28.539> of

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
the guitar I didn't want any kind of

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.420 
the guitar I didn't want any kind of
finish<00:06:29.469> marked<00:06:29.770> and<00:06:29.919> you<00:06:29.979> won't<00:06:30.189> really

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430

finish marked and you won't really
notice<00:06:30.699> it<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.120> mean<00:06:31.300> you<00:06:31.360> can<00:06:31.479> probably<00:06:31.750> see<00:06:32.110> it

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
notice it I mean you can probably see it

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.559 
notice it I mean you can probably see it
right<00:06:33.219> there

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
right there

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.899 
right there
but<00:06:34.860> what<00:06:35.860> are<00:06:35.919> you<00:06:35.979> gonna<00:06:36.069> do<00:06:36.250> it's<00:06:36.580> this<00:06:36.699> one

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
but what are you gonna do it's this one

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.850 
but what are you gonna do it's this one
right<00:06:36.939> here<00:06:37.270> it's<00:06:37.990> a<00:06:38.050> little<00:06:38.229> twisted<00:06:38.529> but<00:06:38.680> hey

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
right here it's a little twisted but hey

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.519 
right here it's a little twisted but hey
it<00:06:39.460> still<00:06:39.639> looks<00:06:39.819> pretty<00:06:39.999> cool<00:06:40.180> it's<00:06:41.169> function

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:41.529 
it still looks pretty cool it's function

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:43.649 
it still looks pretty cool it's function
it's<00:06:42.039> functional<00:06:42.550> perfectly<00:06:43.210> functional

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
it's functional perfectly functional

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.809 
it's functional perfectly functional
fine<00:06:44.349> the<00:06:44.499> way<00:06:44.589> it<00:06:44.620> is<00:06:44.740> headstock<00:06:45.520> I<00:06:45.639> think

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
fine the way it is headstock I think

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.059 
fine the way it is headstock I think
you're<00:06:45.969> not<00:06:46.060> great<00:06:46.409> you<00:06:47.409> notice<00:06:47.649> I<00:06:47.770> haven't

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
you're not great you notice I haven't

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:49.739 
you're not great you notice I haven't

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:49.749 
put any kind of logo on there anything

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.540 
put any kind of logo on there anything
I'm<00:06:50.080> probably<00:06:50.710> gonna<00:06:50.919> put<00:06:51.099> something<00:06:51.399> on<00:06:51.460> the

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
I'm probably gonna put something on the

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.800 
I'm probably gonna put something on the
truss<00:06:51.729> rod<00:06:51.759> and<00:06:52.120> that's<00:06:52.180> about<00:06:52.330> it

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
truss rod and that's about it

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.579 
truss rod and that's about it
maybe<00:06:53.349> eventually<00:06:53.499> I'll<00:06:54.069> put<00:06:54.729> a<00:06:54.759> logo<00:06:55.349> and<00:06:56.349> I

00:06:56.579 --> 00:06:56.589 
maybe eventually I'll put a logo and I

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:58.529 
maybe eventually I'll put a logo and I
still<00:06:56.889> might<00:06:57.129> take<00:06:57.699> this<00:06:57.849> off<00:06:58.089> and<00:06:58.389> I<00:06:58.449> was

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
still might take this off and I was

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:00.050 
still might take this off and I was
thinking<00:06:58.899> about<00:06:58.960> kind<00:06:59.349> of<00:06:59.499> putting<00:06:59.649> a<00:06:59.800> whole

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
thinking about kind of putting a whole

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.309 
thinking about kind of putting a whole
kind<00:07:01.060> of<00:07:01.120> metal<00:07:01.479> plate<00:07:01.719> on<00:07:01.749> there<00:07:02.080> kind<00:07:02.229> of

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
kind of metal plate on there kind of

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.529 
kind of metal plate on there kind of
like<00:07:02.379> a<00:07:02.469> zoo<00:07:02.680> Manus<00:07:03.009> and<00:07:03.669> I'll<00:07:04.029> remove<00:07:04.330> this

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
like a zoo Manus and I'll remove this

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460
