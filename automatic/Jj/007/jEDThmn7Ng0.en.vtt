00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
many times I try through these this kind

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.979 
many times I try through these this kind
of<00:02:40.019> exercise<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:41.160> teach<00:02:41.340> them<00:02:41.640> how<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
of exercise to teach them how don't to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.250 
of exercise to teach them how don't to
sink<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.380> game<00:02:43.670> man<00:02:44.670> against<00:02:44.970> man<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.900> spite

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
sink the game man against man in spite

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.160 
sink the game man against man in spite
of<00:02:46.320> they<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.830> equal<00:02:47.070> numbers<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:48.780> very

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
of they have equal numbers and it's very

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.630 
of they have equal numbers and it's very
important<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.769> for<00:02:49.950> example<00:02:50.040> they<00:02:50.519> are

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
important for me for example they are

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.120 
important for me for example they are
you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.239> one<00:02:51.450> against<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.140> situation<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
you know one against one situation and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.120 
you know one against one situation and
certainly<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.180> bring<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.510> second<00:02:54.930> man<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
certainly we bring a second man to the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.070 
certainly we bring a second man to the
game<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.489> second<00:02:56.910> attacker<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> second<00:02:57.870> a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
game a second attacker in the second a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.070 
game a second attacker in the second a
second<00:02:58.470> defender<00:02:58.890> but<00:02:59.610> they<00:03:00.540> are<00:03:00.600> not<00:03:00.690> wingmen

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
second defender but they are not wingmen

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.300 
second defender but they are not wingmen
two<00:03:01.260> men<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.810> have<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.799> teach<00:03:05.010> them<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
two men so if I have to teach them to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.880 
two men so if I have to teach them to
adapt<00:03:05.760> quickly<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.780> new<00:03:07.140> situation<00:03:07.440> where
