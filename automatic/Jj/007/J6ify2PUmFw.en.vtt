you hit the back one don't make it like
that<00:00:55.640> yes<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:57.660> done<00:00:58.160> and<00:01:00.770> third<00:01:01.770> step<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that yes that done and third step just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
that yes that done and third step just
because<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:05.060> there's<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.830> simpler

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because it and there's the simpler

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
square the hole in it and then on the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.960 
square the hole in it and then on the
back<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.810> stick<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:16.310> cheap<00:01:17.310> if

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
back of that you stick this and cheap if

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
back of that you stick this and cheap if
we've<00:01:18.299> got<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> whole<00:01:18.600> fat<00:01:18.869> better<00:01:19.110> even<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:20.119> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
we've got a whole fat better even if you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.580 
we've got a whole fat better even if you
don't<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:26.040> red<00:01:26.939> piece

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590
