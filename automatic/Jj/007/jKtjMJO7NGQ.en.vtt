00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
hard to tell because these things are

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.350 
hard to tell because these things are

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
sheet down it comes out straight across

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
sheet down it comes out straight across
like<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> edge<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.979> never<00:01:26.369> see

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
like on the edge like this you never see
me<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.270> lay<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> magazine<00:01:28.080> sheet<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.409> like

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this because that will create just a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.330 
this because that will create just a
line<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.320> Rock<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.860> looks<00:01:32.070> weird

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
go to do their textures almost if they

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.640 
go to do their textures almost if they
just<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.870> they'll<00:02:40.260> go<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.440> make

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
just do this they'll go to make

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.470 
just do this they'll go to make
something<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.070> foreground<00:02:41.310> they<00:02:42.300> just

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
something in the foreground they just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.949 
something in the foreground they just
lay<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.690> straight<00:02:43.020> across<00:02:43.670> build<00:02:44.670> up<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.630> is

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
lay it straight across build up that is

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.770 
lay it straight across build up that is
boring<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.740> nature<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.490> well<00:02:48.270> Nature<00:02:48.600> can

you can draw different things like like
I<00:02:56.190> said<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.459> draw<00:02:56.580> straight<00:02:56.820> across

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I said if you draw straight across

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.020 
I said if you draw straight across
that's<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:57.390> teaching<00:02:57.570> anything<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:59.030> don't

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
know so I mean you can keep it simple

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.680 
know so I mean you can keep it simple
just<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.910> all<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.940> need<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.420> do

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and let's say you're left-handed you're

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.150 
and let's say you're left-handed you're
gonna<00:03:10.050> use<00:03:10.170> your<00:03:10.200> right<00:03:10.440> hand<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.800> keep<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.070> out
