00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
here on this rod is a spoon he runs like

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.560 
here on this rod is a spoon he runs like
a<00:00:42.950> four-pound<00:00:44.629> pline<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.230> who<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:46.920> works<00:00:47.570> he

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a four-pound pline is who he works he

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.119 
a four-pound pline is who he works he
doesn't<00:00:49.530> stop<00:00:49.710> soo<00:00:49.920> I'm<00:00:50.520> four<00:00:50.879> pound<00:00:51.149> pline

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
doesn't stop soo I'm four pound pline

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.920 
doesn't stop soo I'm four pound pline
fluorocarbon<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> believe<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.690> runs

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
fluorocarbon I believe it is and it runs

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.420 
fluorocarbon I believe it is and it runs
similar<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.949> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

so<00:01:17.219> there's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.049> fluorocarbon<00:01:19.280> um<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so there's a fluorocarbon um one of the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.109 
so there's a fluorocarbon um one of the
things<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.920> my<00:01:22.920> personal<00:01:23.130> preference<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> a

spooky<00:02:32.130> cleared<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.450> farther<00:02:33.599> north

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
spooky cleared up a little farther north

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.710 
spooky cleared up a little farther north
so<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.920> being<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> case<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.940> are<00:02:36.299> going<00:02:36.510> back

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.319 
so that being the case we are going back
to<00:02:36.930> your<00:02:37.019> standard<00:02:37.410> electronics<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.329> just

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
to your standard electronics and just

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.270 
to your standard electronics and just
got<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:39.750> real<00:02:39.959> aware<00:02:40.079> sometimes<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> don't

your blue gills or whatever else palm
with<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:25.220> notice<00:03:25.610> that's<00:03:25.790> Berkley<00:03:26.480> Gulp<00:03:26.660> on

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
with you notice that's Berkley Gulp on

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.250 
with you notice that's Berkley Gulp on
the<00:03:27.380> end<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.740> sport<00:03:28.520> palm<00:03:31.510> again<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.930> slider

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the end of a sport palm again the slider

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.230 
the end of a sport palm again the slider
here<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.040> that's<00:03:34.430> what<00:03:34.760> slides<00:03:35.030> up<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
here it is that's what slides up and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.670 
here it is that's what slides up and
down<00:03:35.330> your<00:03:35.570> line<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.540> spoon<00:03:38.900> which<00:03:39.470> is

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
down your line and the spoon which is

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.230 
down your line and the spoon which is
probably<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:42.470> it's<00:03:42.830> full<00:03:42.980> quarter<00:03:43.910> ounce

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
probably I think it's full quarter ounce

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.100 
probably I think it's full quarter ounce
maybe<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:44.510> little<00:03:44.630> more

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
maybe a little more

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.510 
maybe a little more
that's<00:03:45.530> what<00:03:45.770> gets<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.040> down<00:03:46.190> there

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
that's what gets you down there

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.800 
that's what gets you down there
especially<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.090> deeper<00:03:47.390> watering<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.780> little

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
especially the deeper watering a little

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.840 
especially the deeper watering a little
more<00:03:48.050> weight<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.410> then<00:03:49.160> when<00:03:49.340> you're<00:03:49.460> jigging

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
more weight and then when you're jigging

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.240 
more weight and then when you're jigging
you<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:50.810> bouncing<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.470> off<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.860> bottom<00:03:52.160> of

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
you just bouncing this off the bottom of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.220 
you just bouncing this off the bottom of
spoon<00:03:52.490> off<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.790> bottom<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.450> when<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.780> fish<00:03:54.020> hit

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
spoon off the bottom and when a fish hit

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.290 
spoon off the bottom and when a fish hit
real<00:03:54.470> thing<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> key<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.670> can<00:03:55.820> drop<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
real thing the key you can drop the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.260 
real thing the key you can drop the
