00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
why would you do that it's quite odd

when things are happening we try and be

when things are happening we try and be
around<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.790> often<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.450> when<00:00:15.929> you're<00:00:16.020> an

to<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.740> something<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.369> usually

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
to see something because it usually

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
to see something because it usually
doesn't<00:00:21.029> happen<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:22.199> you're<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.470> there<00:00:22.500> things

happen in front of you and that's by far

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:36.370 
happen in front of you and that's by far
the<00:00:24.510> best<00:00:24.689> way<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> being<00:00:25.109> here

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.150 

we're<00:00:37.380> interested<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.420> understanding

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
we're interested in understanding

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
we're interested in understanding
landscape<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.050> because<00:00:43.050> these<00:00:43.380> woods<00:00:43.680> are

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
landscape and because these woods are

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.990 
landscape and because these woods are
the<00:00:44.070> University<00:00:44.520> wood<00:00:44.640> lands<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:44.910> they're

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the University wood lands and they're

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.280 
the University wood lands and they're
full<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> people<00:00:45.540> who<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.900> just<00:00:45.930> walking

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
full of people who are not just walking

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.490 
full of people who are not just walking
through<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:46.860> they're<00:00:46.980> studying<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:48.500> my

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
through it but they're studying it my

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
through it but they're studying it my
interest<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.610> listen<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.240> that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
interest is to to listen to the way that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
interest is to to listen to the way that
they<00:00:51.540> describe<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:52.140> visual<00:00:52.320> environment<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
they describe the visual environment and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.190 
they describe the visual environment and
then<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.970> start<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.360> try<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.660> represent<00:00:54.810> and

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
then to start to try and represent and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.160 
then to start to try and represent and
understand<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.740> through<00:00:55.830> picture<00:00:56.220> making

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
understand it through picture making

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.990 
understand it through picture making
with<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> researchers<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.250> other<00:00:59.700> people

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
with the researchers the other people

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
with the researchers the other people
involved<00:01:00.210> through<00:01:00.600> talking<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.650> them<00:01:01.830> you<00:01:01.860> get

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
involved through talking to them you get

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.530 
involved through talking to them you get
a<00:01:02.220> very<00:01:02.430> different<00:01:02.550> idea<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> what's<00:01:03.240> going<00:01:03.360> on

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
a very different idea of what's going on

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.480 
a very different idea of what's going on
it<00:01:04.020> does<00:01:04.230> change<00:01:04.440> how<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> look<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:04.980> things

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
it does change how you look at things

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.490 
it does change how you look at things
we're<00:01:06.119> slightly<00:01:06.420> different<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> perhaps

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we're slightly different to perhaps

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.940 
we're slightly different to perhaps
normal<00:01:08.070> artists<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:08.910> passing<00:01:09.180> through

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
normal artists we're not passing through

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.260 
normal artists we're not passing through
and<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.160> why<00:01:11.310> they've<00:01:11.520> built<00:01:11.700> us<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.910> studio

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and that's why they've built us a studio

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.960 
and that's why they've built us a studio
here<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.100> prolonged<00:01:14.100> engagement<00:01:14.340> with

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
here so it's a prolonged engagement with

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.109 
here so it's a prolonged engagement with
a<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> restricted<00:01:16.080> area<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> we've<00:01:18.000> been

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
a with a restricted area so we've been

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.500 
a with a restricted area so we've been

picture<00:01:39.900> making<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.260> think<00:01:42.530> early<00:01:43.530> printing<00:01:43.980> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
picture making I think early printing is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
picture making I think early printing is
pretty<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> raised<00:01:45.420> surface<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.440> the

pretty from the raised surface of the
printing<00:01:46.890> block<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.400> all<00:01:47.490> printing<00:01:48.000> depends

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
printing block so all printing depends

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.840 
printing block so all printing depends
on<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.830> surface<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.370> you<00:01:50.640> inked

on some kind of surface that you inked
up<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.300> then<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.900> paper<00:01:52.050> on<00:01:52.230> take<00:01:52.830> your

up and then you put paper on take your

up and then you put paper on take your
paper<00:01:53.159> off<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> inks<00:01:54.030> stuck<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.300> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
can start to work that and it's the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.370 
can start to work that and it's the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
image so that wood is more than just a

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.900 
image so that wood is more than just a
printing<00:02:43.710> block<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.130> starting<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.610> affect

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
what that image is it gives people a

what that image is it gives people a
chance<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.820> see<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.300> do<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
chance to see what you can do with the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.560 
chance to see what you can do with the
wood<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.140> again<00:02:49.440> with<00:02:49.650> inks<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.010> well<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:51.420> can

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
wood and again with inks as well you can

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.130 
wood and again with inks as well you can
make<00:02:51.750> inks

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
make inks

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.800 
make inks
without<00:02:52.380> guns<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.730> last<00:02:53.970> thousand<00:02:54.780> years

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
without guns and the last thousand years

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.510 
without guns and the last thousand years
that's<00:02:55.230> been<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.800> principal<00:02:56.190> source<00:02:56.400> of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
that's been the principal source of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760 
that's been the principal source of
black<00:02:56.760> ink<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.240> we'll<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.990> same<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.260> its

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
black ink so we'll do the same in its

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.980 
black ink so we'll do the same in its
taking<00:02:59.160> things<00:02:59.340> from<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.640> wood<00:02:59.820> using<00:03:00.690> them

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
taking things from the wood using them

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.240 
taking things from the wood using them
and<00:03:01.080> using<00:03:01.380> them<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> different<00:03:01.680> way<00:03:01.950> using

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and using them in a different way using

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.640 
and using them in a different way using
than<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> non-scientific<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:04.020> an<00:03:04.110> artistic<00:03:04.440> way

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
than a non-scientific in an artistic way

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.380 
than a non-scientific in an artistic way
so<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.920> broadens<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> kind<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.210> things

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
so it broadens that the kind of things

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.940 
so it broadens that the kind of things
that<00:03:06.540> people<00:03:06.660> can<00:03:06.900> see<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.800> natural

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that people can see that the natural

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
that people can see that the natural
environment<00:03:08.220> should<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.760> used<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.180> we're

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
environment should be used for we're

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.990 
environment should be used for we're
kind<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.200> more<00:03:10.860> accessible<00:03:11.190> edge<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
kind of a more accessible edge to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.030 
kind of a more accessible edge to
activities<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.930> woods

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.699 

I<00:03:21.299> think<00:03:22.299> what<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.900> find<00:03:23.109> inspiring<00:03:23.530> about

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
I think what you find inspiring about

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.399 
I think what you find inspiring about
whiten<00:03:24.219> is<00:03:24.879> is<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:25.989> actually<00:03:26.200> very

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
whiten is is that it is actually very

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.170 
whiten is is that it is actually very
nor<00:03:26.829> it's<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.069> normal<00:03:27.400> place<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:27.969> is<00:03:28.150> a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
nor it's a normal place this is a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.520 
nor it's a normal place this is a
woodland<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.049> could<00:03:29.170> find<00:03:29.379> almost

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
woodland that you could find almost

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.679 
woodland that you could find almost
anywhere<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.010> southern<00:03:30.340> England<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.659> a

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
anywhere in southern England it is a

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:32.819 
anywhere in southern England it is a
special<00:03:32.140> with<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.290> because<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.709> the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
special with it because of the

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.559 
special with it because of the
scientists<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.879> work<00:03:34.060> because<00:03:34.450> it's

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
scientists and the work because it's

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.599 
scientists and the work because it's
part<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.780> Oxford<00:03:35.140> yourself<00:03:35.500> but<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.549> very
