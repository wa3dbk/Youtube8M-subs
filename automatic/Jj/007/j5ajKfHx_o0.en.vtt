00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 a few months ago something happened that 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.330
 you are not going to suspect amazon took out for sale 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.650
 a group of shirts that included 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 phrases like keep calm and violate the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 keep calm and slashed and as you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.869
 you are like I do not know how this company 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 dared to publish 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.279
 those those shirts with those phrases from 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.120
 gender violence the fact is that today 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.489
 you can not buy them anymore because 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.730
 let's say they have assumed the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.710
 manufacturers responsibility and it has been 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.329
 prohibited the commercialization of this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 kind of shirts more than anything because 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.219
 promoting gender violence 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's say that they encourage the mistreatment of 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.410
 men to women 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 in short it seems incredible to me that a brand 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670
 known as it can be 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.129
 amazon is dedicated to manufacturing shirts 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 with these kinds of phrases I said two 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.659
 phrases but is that if research is more 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.049
 you will discover some phrases that are 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.619
 really creepy what kind of 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.110
 person buys these shirts a 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.210
 person sees another person carry a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.340
 T-shirt in which he keeps the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.750
 calm and stabbed and automatically 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.850
 he runs 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.370
 it is clear that these shirts 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.140
 they went from decades to a collective of 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.510
 people who abused women and 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.250
 in a matter of days when it has 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.860
 put in knowledge that they were 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.530
 creating these t-shirts have already been 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 canceled their sales and have been fined 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.830
 with significant amounts of money to 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.830
 the manufacturers
