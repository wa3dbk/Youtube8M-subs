00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
here and basically it's just to get it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.450 
here and basically it's just to get it
straight<00:00:53.149> there<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.329> go<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.460> block

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
straight there just go not the block

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.000 
straight there just go not the block
this<00:00:56.670> way<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.590> it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
this way that way to get it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.600 
this way that way to get it
left<00:01:01.670> letter<00:01:01.940> chittery<00:01:02.980> correct<00:01:03.980> this<00:01:04.460> way

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
left letter chittery correct this way

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.340 
left letter chittery correct this way
that<00:01:04.790> way<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:05.390> know<00:01:05.510> they<00:01:05.690> put<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.140> jack

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
that way you know they put the jack

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.110 
that way you know they put the jack
under<00:01:06.380> here<00:01:06.920> which<00:01:07.040> they're<00:01:07.670> pretty<00:01:07.910> right

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
under here which they're pretty right

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.320 
under here which they're pretty right
cuz<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.510> 90<00:01:08.780> degrees<00:01:08.870> anyway<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.760> it's<00:01:11.180> a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
cuz it's 90 degrees anyway so it's a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.090 
cuz it's 90 degrees anyway so it's a
setup<00:01:11.660> on<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.930> 90<00:01:12.230> degrees<00:01:12.530> playing<00:01:12.920> here<00:01:13.040> you

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
setup on a 90 degrees playing here you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.850 
setup on a 90 degrees playing here you
can<00:01:13.280> see<00:01:13.430> they're<00:01:14.560> sending<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> couple<00:01:15.740> of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
can see they're sending a couple of

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.160 
can see they're sending a couple of
hours<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.610> put<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.300> jack<00:01:17.540> under<00:01:17.720> there<00:01:17.960> that

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
hours so put a jack under there that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.570 
hours so put a jack under there that
also<00:01:18.350> stops<00:01:18.860> migration<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:21.220> that's<00:01:22.220> all<00:01:22.370> cool

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
also stops migration so that's all cool

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.420 
also stops migration so that's all cool
so<00:01:23.290> what<00:01:24.290> we<00:01:24.410> said<00:01:24.650> before<00:01:25.100> when<00:01:25.280> we've<00:01:25.400> done

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
so what we said before when we've done

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.430 
so what we said before when we've done
our<00:01:25.670> deck<00:01:25.850> heights<00:01:26.150> remember<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.080> loot<00:01:27.320> and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
our deck heights remember this loot and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.100 
our deck heights remember this loot and
Bank<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.610> one<00:01:28.850> was<00:01:29.000> tenth<00:01:29.240> hour<00:01:29.450> below<00:01:29.630> and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
Bank this one was tenth hour below and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.070 
Bank this one was tenth hour below and
at<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.650> end<00:01:30.860> over<00:01:31.040> six<00:01:31.660> so<00:01:32.660> what<00:01:32.840> I've<00:01:32.960> done

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
at this end over six so what I've done

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.140 
at this end over six so what I've done
is<00:01:33.729> offset<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:35.140> fourth<00:01:36.140> hour<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:38.000> going

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
is offset it fourth hour so it's going

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.990 
is offset it fourth hour so it's going
to<00:01:38.210> be<00:01:38.330> fourth<00:01:38.630> power<00:01:39.490> it's<00:01:40.490> gonna<00:01:40.580> cut<00:01:40.820> more

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
to be fourth power it's gonna cut more

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.160 
to be fourth power it's gonna cut more
off<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.300> end<00:01:41.540> then<00:01:41.660> this<00:01:41.810> end

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
off this end then this end

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.650 
off this end then this end
so<00:01:42.410> by<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.680> time<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:42.950> zero<00:01:43.250> dexhart<00:01:43.729> how

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
so by the time we zero dexhart how

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.630 
so by the time we zero dexhart how
Pistons<00:01:45.110> will<00:01:45.290> be<00:01:45.380> zero<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.860> zero<00:01:45.890> because

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
Pistons will be zero and zero because

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.590 
Pistons will be zero and zero because
they're<00:01:46.820> ten<00:01:47.000> below<00:01:47.330> here<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.140> six<00:01:48.590> here

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
they're ten below here and six here

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.740 
they're ten below here and six here
here's<00:01:50.600> my<00:01:50.690> dial<00:01:51.050> here<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:54.160> see<00:01:55.509> 10<00:01:56.509> on<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
here's my dial here so see 10 on the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.469 
here's my dial here so see 10 on the
dial<00:01:57.580> all<00:01:58.580> right<00:01:58.820> we'll<00:01:59.030> make<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.180> bit<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.390> noise

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
dial all right we'll make a bit of noise

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
dial all right we'll make a bit of noise
and<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.990> wall<00:02:03.259> SATs<00:02:03.649> at<00:02:03.890> 10

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and that wall SATs at 10

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:15.280 
and that wall SATs at 10
as<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.510> rapid<00:02:06.960> traverse<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.860 

they<00:02:16.099> say

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
they say

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
they say
this<00:02:18.470> happy

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
this happy

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.470 
this happy
say<00:02:20.040> hey

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.480 

oops

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.150 

that's<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.180> we've<00:02:28.300> got<00:02:28.450> king-6<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.980> our

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
that's what we've got king-6 that's our

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.810 
that's what we've got king-6 that's our
offset<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:32.200> tight<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:32.830> both<00:02:33.040> elephants<00:02:33.640> in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
offset it so tight for both elephants in

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.100 
offset it so tight for both elephants in
from<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.360> in<00:02:35.730> price<00:02:36.730> going<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.240> nail<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
from that in price going to nail that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.440 
from that in price going to nail that
right

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.670 

I<00:02:41.510> can

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.400 

so<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:46.830> basically<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.960> trying<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.050> set<00:02:49.290> up
