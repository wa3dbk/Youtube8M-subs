00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.760
 good friends welcome to a new 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.970
 minecraft video in this video les 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.670
 I come to share my little demo of 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:34.120
 good slide is lemon a brawn minecraft 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.050
 is a useful and very difficult way lol the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 true to see 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.850
 yes yes it is a very useful way to find 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.740
 It's lines I know many of us 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.700
 we have problems to find venues 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:54.120
 line because today we come to a cavern and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.920
 we did not find it a piece of luck 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.340
 that you have and you find a slide so 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.620
 this mode adds a 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.960
 this information when we press the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.690
 f 3 key in the lower left 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.540
 good not so inferior we will find what 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.740
 that puts seed that is the seed of the map 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.320
 and below it puts is lines two points and not 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.190
 well then when we go normally 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.860
 walking around exploring 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.740
 I will have to show us something to 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.070
 see I'm going to order if we find 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.030
 quickly a although I'll explain 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 the charts are big squares in the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.230
 that minecraft is divided 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.620
 that is to say a sun has 16 blocks by 16 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.150
 16 long by 16 wide 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:50.130
 then minecraft is divided into 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.020
 charles then for example we see that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.869
 places 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 here he does not put anything and here he puts something 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.920
 then it is not lines is not lines 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 and world one hyde what it says is that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.759
 we are in a show where Danish is exposed 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.120
 line but we are not up to the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.430
 right is to say we are not in a place 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.129
 suitable for crisis to put then 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.640
 we should go down at least until the 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.840
 level of a few levels until 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.450
 put in the right place let's see 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.410
 Let's remember that you never have to 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.410
 dig down 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.930
 with exposing everything that this was not 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.430
 fixed up 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.260
 cool 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.180
 as we go down 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.180
 to see still does not put anything 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.990
 here put and now put Friday barge 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.720
 means that we are already at the height is 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.600
 say the level indicated we are in a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.010
 level 30 where they begin to expose is 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.739
 the years 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.460
 I'm going to do a little bit we see that here we 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.700
 days appear if I go up 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.370
 auto provides a point will arrive 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.420
 here where it says that we're going to the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.420
 indicated vegetable 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.890
 then we will practically know here 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.360
 that we are in the background is line 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:40.230
 left ends here a room of 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.230
 1616 where they will be exposed then 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.430
 this study and the truth because already 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.400
 now we can know how good is the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.610
 easier without getting too new 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:07.690
 got like 80 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:09.730
 only from the streaming review as 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.640
 a description and violent downloads 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.239
 all different versions of minecraft 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.510
 until the nights 1.7 point four I think 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.020
 what is good 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.700
 answer all and if you want the morning 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:29.210
 it could be a tutorial from a farm 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.040
 Slim is like buying more line and you can 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.710

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.400
