00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
got from not going into this game was

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.610 
got from not going into this game was
because<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.150> had<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.300> depth<00:03:32.630> chart<00:03:32.870> said<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
because I had a depth chart said the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.320 
because I had a depth chart said the
wrong<00:03:33.800> way<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:34.130> again<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.700> like<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:34.940> mix<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.240> up

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
wrong way so again I like to mix it up

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.820 
wrong way so again I like to mix it up
coming<00:03:35.750> out<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:35.960> cover<00:03:36.110> one<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.530> guy<00:03:36.710> was

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
nice counter and out of the thing this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.270 
nice counter and out of the thing this
is<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.670> tight<00:03:55.970> tight<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.990> slot<00:03:57.470> or<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:57.860> don't

you<00:03:58.340> another<00:03:58.610> nameless<00:03:58.820> plat<00:03:59.180> forgot<00:03:59.600> but

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
you another nameless plat forgot but

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.630 
you another nameless plat forgot but
here<00:04:00.020> we<00:04:00.110> go<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.500> don't<00:04:01.040> know<00:04:01.100> if<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.250> guys<00:04:01.400> knew

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
here we go I don't know if you guys knew

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.520 
here we go I don't know if you guys knew
this<00:04:01.790> but<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.120> always<00:04:02.480> look<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.720> motion<00:04:03.260> and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
this but I always look to motion and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.710 
this but I always look to motion and
outside<00:04:03.920> wide<00:04:04.100> receiver<00:04:04.490> for<00:04:04.880> extra<00:04:05.209> blocking

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
outside wide receiver for extra blocking

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.140 
outside wide receiver for extra blocking
and<00:04:06.200> sometimes<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.190> does<00:04:07.550> work<00:04:07.790> really<00:04:07.820> good

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
and sometimes it does work really good

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.000 
and sometimes it does work really good
like<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.750> think<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:08.990> can<00:04:09.200> see<00:04:09.350> here<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.680> most<00:04:09.860> of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
like I think I can see here and most of

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.350 
like I think I can see here and most of
my<00:04:10.100> players<00:04:10.340> you're<00:04:10.459> gonna<00:04:10.520> see<00:04:10.730> me<00:04:10.850> motioning

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
my players you're gonna see me motioning

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.300 
my players you're gonna see me motioning
to<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.990> gap<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.740> run<00:04:12.980> or

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
to the gap that I like to run or

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.830 
to the gap that I like to run or
somebody's<00:04:13.910> listening<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.390> certain<00:04:14.540> guy

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
somebody's listening in a certain guy

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.360 
somebody's listening in a certain guy
but<00:04:15.110> like<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.290> send<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:15.530> wide<00:04:15.800> receiver<00:04:16.220> it

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
but like to send that wide receiver it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.220 
but like to send that wide receiver it
actually<00:04:16.640> slows<00:04:16.760> him<00:04:17.090> down<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.870> here<00:04:18.080> we<00:04:18.200> go

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
actually slows him down so here we go

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.080 
actually slows him down so here we go
can<00:04:18.830> go<00:04:18.980> ahead<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.130> lurk<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.549> middle<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
can go ahead and lurk the middle of the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.120 
can go ahead and lurk the middle of the
field<00:04:20.239> but<00:04:20.420> we<00:04:20.540> get<00:04:20.720> stuck<00:04:20.989> with<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.380> dt<00:04:21.830> and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
field but we get stuck with the dt and

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.430 
field but we get stuck with the dt and
he<00:04:22.760> gets<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.030> little<00:04:23.210> first<00:04:23.510> down<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.020> its<00:04:24.140> third

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
he gets a little first down so its third

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.270 
he gets a little first down so its third
and<00:04:24.710> 18<00:04:25.330> he<00:04:26.330> has<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.660> long<00:04:27.020> way<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.320> get<00:04:27.770> there<00:04:28.040> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
and 18 he has a long way to get there so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.570 
and 18 he has a long way to get there so
I'm

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580
