one because he defended well and held
the<00:01:16.280> draw<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:16.729> mean<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:17.570> not<00:01:18.079> pleasant<00:01:18.549> to<00:01:19.549> get

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
the draw I mean it's not pleasant to get

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.300

such<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> bad<00:01:20.780> position<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:22.070> played

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
such a bad position and if it played

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.030 
such a bad position and if it played
night<00:01:22.520> before<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:23.680> it<00:01:24.680> would<00:01:24.799> have<00:01:24.860> had<00:01:25.009> a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
night before then it would have had a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.429 
night before then it would have had a
different<00:01:25.670> result<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.680> mmm<00:01:27.680> that's<00:01:29.290> not<00:01:30.290> very

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439

good<00:01:30.560> but<00:01:30.829> I<00:01:31.450> mean<00:01:33.280> bad<00:01:34.280> positions<00:01:34.759> when<00:01:36.159> well

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159
