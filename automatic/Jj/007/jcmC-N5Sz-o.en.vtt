00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
sequencer and the NPC to control this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.510 
sequencer and the NPC to control this
and<00:02:08.729> control<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.370> going

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.559 
guess just over with me let's go all
right<00:02:19.360> next<00:02:19.930> thing<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.640> MPC<00:02:22.330> I

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
right next thing is this on the MPC I

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.210 
right next thing is this on the MPC I
don't<00:02:23.200> know<00:02:23.290> if<00:02:23.380> you're<00:02:23.560> probably<00:02:23.770> others<00:02:24.069> do

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
don't know if you're probably others do

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.180 
don't know if you're probably others do
this<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.550> it's<00:02:25.270> probably<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:25.900> light<00:02:26.170> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.390 

all<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.459> MPC<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.750> set<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.260> i'ma<00:02:33.130> show<00:02:33.340> you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
all the MPC to set this i'ma show you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.339 
all the MPC to set this i'ma show you
exactly<00:02:33.730> how<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.030> do<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.360> or<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.900> tell<00:02:35.170> you

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
exactly how to do this or just tell you

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.180 
exactly how to do this or just tell you
basically<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.670> must<00:02:36.910> basically<00:02:37.510> go<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:38.190> shift

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
basically you must basically go to shift

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.250 
basically you must basically go to shift
F<00:02:40.090> 9<00:02:40.590> f9<00:02:41.610> all<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.930> sync

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
F 9 f9 all you have to do is just sync

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.680 
F 9 f9 all you have to do is just sync
it<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:45.160> go<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.519> mode<00:02:45.760> MIDI<00:02:46.090> clock

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
it and go to mode MIDI clock

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.070 
it and go to mode MIDI clock
it'll<00:02:46.989> sink<00:02:47.230> out<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.860> sink<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.970> B<00:02:49.299> you

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
it'll sink out and sink out a and B you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.690 
it'll sink out and sink out a and B you
don't<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.680> anything<00:02:51.010> with<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> sync

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
don't have to do anything with the sync

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.430 
don't have to do anything with the sync
end<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.540> same<00:02:52.810> thing<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.170> have<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.350> do

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
end the same thing you have to do

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.949 
end the same thing you have to do
anything<00:02:53.799> with<00:02:54.069> once<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.060> do<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:55.269> all<00:02:55.720> you

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
anything with once you do that all you

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.559 
anything with once you do that all you
have<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.140> do<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.410> make<00:02:56.650> sure<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.920> your<00:02:57.569> your

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
have to do is make sure that your your

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.320 
have to do is make sure that your your
sense<00:02:58.900> module<00:02:59.380> will<00:02:59.590> automatically<00:03:00.220> work<00:03:00.430> but

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
sense module will automatically work but

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.410 
sense module will automatically work but
your<00:03:02.010> keyboard<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.310> different<00:03:03.760> story<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
your keyboard is a different story the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.880 
your keyboard is a different story the
keyboard<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.319> to<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.650> make<00:03:05.860> sure

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
keyboard all you have to do is make sure

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.580 
keyboard all you have to do is make sure
that<00:03:06.040> it's<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.459> channel<00:03:06.880> 1<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:08.410> don't

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
that it's on channel 1 because you don't

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.160 
that it's on channel 1 because you don't
worry<00:03:08.830> about<00:03:09.010> any<00:03:09.390> MIDI<00:03:10.390> with<00:03:10.599> this<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.049> is

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
worry about any MIDI with this this is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.530 
worry about any MIDI with this this is
just<00:03:11.380> how<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.769> play<00:03:12.190> whatever<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.209> want<00:03:13.299> to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540

project of that ok for the rest of it I
just<00:03:47.109> have<00:03:48.299> my<00:03:49.299> cord<00:03:50.069> set<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.370> whenever<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
just have my cord set to whenever I

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.690 
just have my cord set to whenever I
press<00:03:52.690> play<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:54.160> don't<00:03:54.340> have<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.519> press

press play on this I don't have to press

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.009 
press play on this I don't have to press
record<00:03:54.880> just<00:03:55.450> press<00:03:55.660> play

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
record just press play

this will automatically play with it and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.509 
this will automatically play with it and
then<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.019> could<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.200> step<00:03:59.590> my<00:03:59.769> stuff<00:04:00.069> on<00:04:00.280> this

then I could just step my stuff on this

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.449 
then I could just step my stuff on this

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.210 
the synth module I play everything
through<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.209> keyboard<00:04:04.720> which<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.799> puts<00:04:06.040> it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
through the keyboard which and puts it

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.759 
through the keyboard which and puts it
into<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.519> MPC<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.690> input<00:04:08.200> sit<00:04:08.380> out<00:04:08.560> the
