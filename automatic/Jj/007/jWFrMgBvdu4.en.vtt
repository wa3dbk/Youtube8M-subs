it's<00:01:56.790> bad<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.049> mean<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.829> mounts<00:01:59.189> looks<00:01:59.460> so

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it's bad but I mean that mounts looks so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
it's bad but I mean that mounts looks so
good<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.869> fly<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.469> chocobo<00:02:01.979> as
