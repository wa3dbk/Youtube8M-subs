thinking outside the box and no time at
all<00:00:20.340> watching<00:00:20.910> television<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.769> that's

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
all watching television so that's

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.349 
all watching television so that's
probably<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> reasons<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.150> keep

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
probably one of the reasons that we keep

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.519 
probably one of the reasons that we keep
it<00:00:24.510> seem<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> perfectly<00:00:25.380> reasonable

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it seem like a perfectly reasonable

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.550 
it seem like a perfectly reasonable
pursuit<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> me<00:00:26.750> never<00:00:27.750> mind<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> apparent

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
pursuit to me never mind the apparent

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.349 
pursuit to me never mind the apparent
lunacy<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> sticking<00:00:29.460> one's<00:00:29.609> hands<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:30.300> a

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
led me a question most everything I've

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.620 
led me a question most everything I've
learned<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:29.859> b-school<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.299> think<00:01:31.509> that

these have existed on this planet for

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.190 
these have existed on this planet for

many millions of years and us humans for
a<00:01:35.229> mere<00:01:35.469> hundred<00:01:35.679> thousand<00:01:36.369> that's<00:01:37.119> pretty

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
a mere hundred thousand that's pretty

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.109 
a mere hundred thousand that's pretty
humbling<00:01:37.659> for<00:01:38.200> should<00:01:38.560> be<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:39.549> I<00:01:39.579> set<00:01:39.849> out<00:01:39.880> to

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
humbling for should be so I set out to

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.850 
humbling for should be so I set out to
discover<00:01:40.329> what<00:01:40.719> these<00:01:40.929> did<00:01:41.200> before<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:41.649> came

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
how does that translate into our white

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.580 
how does that translate into our white

in this box make their own beeswax in

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:36.710 
in this box make their own beeswax in
there<00:05:36.120> anyway

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
there anyway

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.260 
there anyway
then<00:05:37.199> it<00:05:37.349> sells<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.979> right<00:05:38.130> sizes<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.910> they

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
then it sells the right sizes and they

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.450 
then it sells the right sizes and they
put<00:05:39.479> them<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.810> right<00:05:39.930> places<00:05:40.199> so<00:05:41.190> this<00:05:41.280> is

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
put them in the right places so this is
