00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.919
 chapter 5 the maturation of life 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.289
 the most important period 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.160
 the maturation of life is the period corresponding to the development of the fruit 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 of the grapes well to last an average of about 45 days giving start generally 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.079
 in the middle of summer to finish in early autumn 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.530
 maturation of the fruit 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.580
 a correct maturation of the fruit supposes a balance between the maturity 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.320
 phenolic of the grape itself and they took metric what is the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.590
 sugar that will later be transformed into alcohol 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.470
 which will give us abi with an alcoholic degree well integrated in the fruit 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.820
 obviously maturity 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.310
 supposes an increase of the weight of the fruit because of its growth by the increase 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820
 of the volume of water it contains 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 finally we must bear in mind that the aromatic maturity 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.500
 accelerates in the last two weeks before the harvest if some 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460
 balanced temperatures with a good thermal investment villa night 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 changes that occur in maturation 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.070
 increase of the weight of the uba 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.340
 the grape goes from being the size of a pea to its normal size 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.250
 and from being rather hard to being juicy carlos to 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.580
 The increase in size is due to the accumulation of intracellular water in the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.090
 plant 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.170
 the rainfall in this period 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 contribute to considerably increase the size and weight of the UBA 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.490
 in some areas the vineyards are irrigated 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.149
 to increase production 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.479
 but the most extended 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.229
 we do not allow this practice because it goes against the quality of the grape 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.900
 it is best to have light to moderate rainfall for a good 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.550
 maturation of the grape 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.960
 however excessive rain dilutes the interesting compounds of the grape 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.309
 that are forming 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.279
 which translates into a lower quality grape and can even produce 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279
 rotting problems in bunches 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.749
 increase in sugar content 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.339
 glucose plus fructose 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.799
 there is a considerable increase in glucose concentrations and 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.210
 fructose during the entire period 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.560
 up to generally close or higher levels 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.739
 at 200 grams per liter 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.160
 the insolation is fundamental for the synthesis of sugars the content in 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.920
 sugar that results in wine 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.209
 in ethyl alcohol content 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.239
 for every 17 grams of sugar 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.979
 a degree of alcohol will be produced during alcoholic fermentation 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.149
 3 decrease in acid content 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.139
 the uba before summer is tremendously acidic 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.789
 During this period the values ​​decrease progressively until 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.969
 be placed around 4 6 degrees liter of total acidity 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.359
 tartaric acid 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.869
 the sunny little summers more typical of the countries of northern Europe 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.749
 favor greater acidity than dry, hot summers 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.919
 Maturation coefficients that relate acidity and concentration 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.810
 in sugars are what will determine the optimum maturation moment and the 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.809
 beginning of the harvest 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.639
 color modification 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.469
 there is a change of color going from a greenish shade due to the great 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.509
 amount of chlorophyll that receives 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.469
 to the typical color of the variety 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.869
 yellowish tones and it is white and reddish or bruised almost extinct 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.759
 throughout this period the uapa increasing its concentration in 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.390
 polyphenolic substances 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.589
 which later bernardine taste and smell 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.120
 especially the tannins 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.699
 which are the substances that make up the phenolic compounds of the uba 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.449
 concretely they are found in the colored substances of the uba 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.449
 located in the hole 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.119
 formation of aromatic and gustatory substances 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.049
 to achieve these conditions the following conditions must be met 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.239
 climatic 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.299
 it is necessary that it makes a lot of sun but that it is not excessive heat 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.699
 It is important that I should lightly 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.669
 It is very important for the synthesis of quality aromatic substances 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.870
 and of pleasant perception in the mouth 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.180
 the one that the temperature difference between day and night 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.740
 expands that is to say sunny days and not excessively hot with abundance 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.520
 of cool nights
