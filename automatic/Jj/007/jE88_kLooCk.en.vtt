00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 new moon are welcome he is 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.890
 finally there the scan and his name is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.750
 Dino , you can shine yourself 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.889
 which of them is sweeter I think 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.690
 still the right because there the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.639
 buttonholes and ears more money 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 but gets such a closer in the dino 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.140
 Of course, costume is not bad either 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.960
 we'll see the animation again 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.090
 while in the skin and have the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.900
 compared to the classic exact and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 go to the dino glass 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.969
 I think so, too 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.420
 the same now he jumps on the button 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.750
 shows his little tail when he laughs 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.059
 It is completely stimulating , that is also true 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 Guided and now we look at 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.120
 again laughs with his back to the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.129
 ground everything works here are not 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.629
 determine differences but if you 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.350
 in recall, for example, he gets three 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 small building blocks out with the letters 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.289
 lol 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 that has the classic channel to 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.930
 For example not that means we can 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.699
 Now surrender to the skills 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.440
 first throw the boomerang 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.940
 he looks a bit different too 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.430
 overall a bit bigger and 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.940
 nice if I come here again 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.340
 just a little bit voluminous now 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.880
 Let's take a look at the passive stacks 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.600
 of skill 123 same circles this 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.780
 animation so no difference here 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.780
 Now we jump once over him over whether 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.760
 that's completely the same that's us 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.760
 now have to go to the uniform 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.200
 suck it like a little hat 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.470
 Of course, also look like the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.470
 turn small and 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.380
 a green dinosaur and if that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.159
 skills purely here he throws a house 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 Forward 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.829
 Here is Dante the ground that is the same 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.869
 when he jumps a little come 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.759
 that's right here, too 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.759
 again the cottage seen 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.090
 and the multi is completely the same 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.260
 that means his cow is different his 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.770
 Shape differently and have a pity now 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.600
 we did not see the ricola animation 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.690
 but then he takes a helicopter 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.950
 and throw the oven floor 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.840
 otherwise it was us 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.840
 wait again until the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:48.270
 hopefully he will not die before 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:50.130
 So we want to do my 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.840
 and then I show you the gallery for 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.530
 animation in general, I find the skin 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.910
 Here he takes luka bloom and choke 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.230
 him on the floor that makes the other 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.480
 not that is correct in any case 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:08.520
 the coalition kills a dinosaur 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.960
 milk may kill me again here then 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.000
 look at the tour the commitment of 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.770
 At first it was me called dino 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.440
 Hope you liked it I think that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.110
 skin actually more often here more beautiful 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.240
 Just the reanimation always provide 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 so take a little fun with these 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.540
 next time have to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.540
 that was called dino
