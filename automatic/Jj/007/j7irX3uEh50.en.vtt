00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:11.880
 I know there is a lot of time because I 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.130
 you hurt this way you broke the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.130
 promise that I believed so much 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.010
 of love was learned and learned a couple 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.110
 of things that also suffers from love 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.240
 good clear bring the roses and that 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.220
 when darker they turn you know no 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.010
 you worry is because the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.110
 dawn and not suffer is just why 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.450
 you said god I understand the ways is that 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.850
 we once did the two there that 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.770
 you're happy what you wanted me typical 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.500
 honestly I do not understand what you 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.750
 failed you left my side and you caused me 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.390
 a thousand wounds although the pain is strong you 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.370
 I swear I will not die because I know I'll find 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.350
 the way out of my problems I am not the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.019
 typical that you want to cut if you even 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.170
 sorrows for love understand so many things 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.629
 I'm just crying, suffering without you 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.269
 but what more is learned after this 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.909
 sometimes love with the highest bidder is 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.190
 sell hey and what do I do tell me if you were 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.470
 an illusion I swear you never went through 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.600
 my mind the word treason and so many 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.820
 promises that are running so many 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.010
 promises that will easily take them 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 the wind so many promises that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.000
 they broke my heart so easy now 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.130
 It has a sign and it says fragile 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.260
 sincerely I enriched in this would be 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.600
 brave but look at me here I am 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.940
 They did not fail me as long as 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.090
 you promised yesterday 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.680
 you know, I give 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 you 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 there is the wind took it 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.409
 the sad one was him 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.890
 it hurts me today 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.030
 you said the wind 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.030
 I wear 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.270
 the sad reality sometimes creates without 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.399
 be active to lose so that now you 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.500
 wounds and then I will hurt this 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.479
 hell of sadness you do not know how much I 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.300
 I despair and this is aware that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.940
 everything is returned nothing can change is 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.400
 hard to forget what I'm trying to do 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.670
 If I know I'm going to fail, I'll always 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.099
 more in the broken promise is finished not 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.840
 there is the last hate note that passes the 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.970
 time and know that I do not have you 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.760
 happily in your walk and not to 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.400
 I stop you I hold on to you how could you 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.579
 pretend you fell in love with me now 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.890
 It makes me suffer what it is to look at myself 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.959
 mirror if I find myself shattered and you 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.390
 I see in the reflection it does it better but 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.760
 never find yourself in my place after 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.430
 to have left you I do not miss you no 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.709
 I can resign myself if I gave you my whole life 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.470
 Now tell me how I live if my life is 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.720
 lost I never thought to love and that will hurt you 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.819
 so much if love makes you happy because the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.150
 pain I can not stand it anymore is that it is so much 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.250
 only for loneliness if you did not feel narro 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.740
 you would have told the truth 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.810
 a story that is only one conviction has 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.520
 made for me that love is not worth the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.660
 pain 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.660
 you gave me yesterday you do not know it hurts me today 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.400
 there is the wind you can hear it 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.170
 yes 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:30.200
 the sad reality 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.200
 yesterday you know it hurts 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.310
 that you said the wind took it away and if 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.620
 It hurts 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.620
 give the sad reality
