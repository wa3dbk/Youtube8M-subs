exam feel calm no more fear from exam so
another<00:00:09.719> question<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.889> right<00:00:11.160> at

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
another question is I'm going right at

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.160 
another question is I'm going right at
this<00:00:11.610> process<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.210> spermatogenesis

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this process of spermatogenesis

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.580 
this process of spermatogenesis
it<00:00:13.500> starts<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.309> puberty<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:16.049> special

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it starts at puberty now what special

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
it starts at puberty now what special
happens<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.190> puberty<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
happens at puberty that the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
happens at puberty that the
spermatogenesis<00:00:19.109> starts<00:00:19.770> now<00:00:20.160> when<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> was

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
spermatogenesis starts now when it was

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.700 
spermatogenesis starts now when it was
not<00:00:20.880> there<00:00:21.180> since<00:00:21.570> birth<00:00:21.840> outcomes<00:00:22.260> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
not there since birth outcomes I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.109 
not there since birth outcomes I
thinking<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.189> changes<00:00:23.609> happen<00:00:23.970> at

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
thinking some changes happen at

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:24.890 
thinking some changes happen at
everybody

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
everybody

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.259 
everybody
that<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.380> process<00:00:25.769> got<00:00:25.980> initiated<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.119> let

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that this process got initiated so let

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
that this process got initiated so let
us<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.990> special<00:00:28.260> happens<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.010> now

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
us see what special happens here now

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.319 
us see what special happens here now
increase<00:00:30.779> secretion<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.650> gonadotropic

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
increase secretion of gonadotropic

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
increase secretion of gonadotropic
releasing<00:00:33.329> hormone<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.350> remember<00:00:34.829> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
releasing hormone then you remember we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.970 
releasing hormone then you remember we
discussed<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:37.110> quite<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> few

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
discussed with them about quite a few

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.369 
discussed with them about quite a few
more<00:00:38.190> words<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.120> chemical<00:00:39.660> coordination

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
more words in the chemical coordination

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.819 
more words in the chemical coordination
lesson<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> task<00:00:41.100> 11<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
lesson of task 11 so we will make use of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.250 
lesson of task 11 so we will make use of
that<00:00:44.190> knowledge<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.879> hormones<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:46.050> know

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that knowledge of hormones so we know

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.310 
that knowledge of hormones so we know
that<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> hypothalamus<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.170> brain

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that from the hypothalamus in the brain

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.250 
that from the hypothalamus in the brain
electron<00:00:50.280> glands<00:00:50.579> once<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.719> red<00:00:51.989> curve

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
electron glands once this red curve

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.939 
electron glands once this red curve
gland<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.520> hypothalamus<00:00:54.949> which

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
gland which is the hypothalamus which

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.639 
gland which is the hypothalamus which
acts<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.120> link<00:00:57.629> between<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.289> nervous

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
acts as a link between the nervous

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
acts as a link between the nervous
system<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> endocrine<00:01:00.270> system<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.140> we

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
system and the endocrine system and we

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
system and the endocrine system and we
have<00:01:01.949> another<00:01:02.250> gland<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:03.329> called

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have another gland which is also called

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
have another gland which is also called
the<00:01:03.780> master<00:01:04.260> gland<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.769> picture<00:01:05.250> click<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the master gland or picture click and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.200 
the master gland or picture click and
located<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.080> below<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> hypothalamus<00:01:08.210> now

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
located just below the hypothalamus now

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.330 
located just below the hypothalamus now
the<00:01:09.270> body<00:01:09.770> synchronization<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> such<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the body synchronization is such that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.550 
the body synchronization is such that
pituitary<00:01:11.970> gland<00:01:12.240> controls<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> secretion

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
pituitary gland controls the secretion

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
pituitary gland controls the secretion
of<00:01:13.619> hormones<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.640> other<00:01:14.939> glands<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
of hormones from all other glands of the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.260 
of hormones from all other glands of the
body<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.380> hypothalamus<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.460> turn<00:01:17.700> controls

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
body and hypothalamus in turn controls

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
body and hypothalamus in turn controls
the<00:01:18.509> pituitary<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the pituitary so that is how it is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
the pituitary so that is how it is
organized<00:01:21.450> inside<00:01:21.990> our<00:01:22.140> body<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.979> what

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
organized inside our body now what

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.120 
organized inside our body now what
happens<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:24.090> puberty<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.290> secretion<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
happens is at puberty the secretion of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.450 
happens is at puberty the secretion of
gonadotropic<00:01:27.080> releasing<00:01:28.080> hormone<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
gonadotropic releasing hormone from the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.560 
gonadotropic releasing hormone from the
hypothalamus<00:01:30.350> increases<00:01:31.909> now<00:01:32.909> when<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
hypothalamus increases now when this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
hypothalamus increases now when this
hormone<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> often<00:01:34.890> known<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.250> G<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> Rh

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
hormone this is often known as G and Rh

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
hormone this is often known as G and Rh
so<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.590> releasing<00:01:38.250> hormone<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so that this releasing hormone is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
so that this releasing hormone is
secreted<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> hypothalamus<00:01:40.860> what

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
secreted from the hypothalamus what

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
secreted from the hypothalamus what
happens<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.600> stimulates<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
happens it actually stimulates the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.880 
happens it actually stimulates the
pituitary<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:45.060> secrete<00:01:45.090> these<00:01:45.960> hormones<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
pituitary to secrete these hormones that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.080 
pituitary to secrete these hormones that
is<00:01:47.070> LH<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> FSH<00:01:48.290> what<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> age<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.490> lymph<00:01:50.820> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
is LH and FSH what is age it is lymph in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.359 
is LH and FSH what is age it is lymph in
izing<00:01:51.630> hormone<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.770> discussed<00:01:53.220> about

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
izing hormone we have discussed about

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.969 
izing hormone we have discussed about
all<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.880> 102<00:01:54.390> class<00:01:54.750> length<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.860> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
all these 102 class length so if you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.039 
all these 102 class length so if you
want<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> quick<00:01:57.270> recap<00:01:57.450> going

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
want to just have a quick recap going

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.580 
want to just have a quick recap going
there<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.649> FSH<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.899> follicle<00:02:00.899> stimulating

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
there and FSH is follicle stimulating

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
there and FSH is follicle stimulating
hormone<00:02:03.649> now<00:02:04.649> due<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.700> release<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
hormone now due to the release of the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.779 
hormone now due to the release of the
gonadotropin-releasing<00:02:08.099> hormone<00:02:08.479> from<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.089 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the
calibers<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.899> sends<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.469> signal<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
calibers it sends a signal to the

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.740 
calibers it sends a signal to the
pituitary<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:13.780> NH<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.739> FSH<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.540> of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
pituitary these NH and FSH and one of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.990 
pituitary these NH and FSH and one of
these<00:02:16.900> hormones<00:02:17.500> too<00:02:17.829> so<00:02:18.250> let's<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.609> a<00:02:18.700> quick

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
these hormones too so let's have a quick

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.929 
these hormones too so let's have a quick
look<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.920> how<00:02:21.069> they<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.579> connected

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
look see this is how they have connected

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.809 
look see this is how they have connected
so<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.659> is<00:02:22.840> hypothalamus<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
so this is hypothalamus and this is the

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.270 
so this is hypothalamus and this is the
to<00:02:25.030> take<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.930> sign<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.530> anterior

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
to take this this sign is anterior

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.910 
to take this this sign is anterior
pituitary<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.329> this<00:02:28.780> side<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.349> posterior

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
pituitary and this side is posterior

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.770 
pituitary and this side is posterior
pituitary<00:02:30.459> we<00:02:30.849> have<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.150> close<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.540> other

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
pituitary we have this close to other

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.140 
pituitary we have this close to other
things<00:02:32.079> now<00:02:32.620> what<00:02:32.799> happens<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.400> when<00:02:33.909> when<00:02:34.120> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
things now what happens is when when I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.479 
things now what happens is when when I
don't<00:02:34.450> drop<00:02:34.659> anything<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:36.040> created

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
don't drop anything what is it created

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.300 
don't drop anything what is it created
from<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.510> hypothalamus<00:02:38.079> it<00:02:38.590> sends<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.099> signal

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
from the hypothalamus it sends a signal

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.580 
from the hypothalamus it sends a signal
to<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.760> anterior<00:02:40.329> pituitary<00:02:40.590> which

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
to the anterior pituitary which

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.890 
to the anterior pituitary which
stimulates<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> secretion<00:02:42.639> of<00:02:43.090> LH<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> FSH

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
stimulates the secretion of LH and FSH

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.129 
stimulates the secretion of LH and FSH
from<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.769> mere<00:02:45.040> patootie<00:02:45.700> now<00:02:46.269> once<00:02:46.510> LH<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.079> FSH

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
from a mere patootie now once LH and FSH

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.649 
from a mere patootie now once LH and FSH
are<00:02:47.680> simply<00:02:48.010> there<00:02:48.250> where<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.700> they<00:02:48.849> act<00:02:49.090> they

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
are simply there where do they act they

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.929 
are simply there where do they act they
act<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.169> which<00:02:50.439> part<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.250> body<00:02:51.519> or<00:02:51.730> on

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
act on which part of the body or on

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.509 
act on which part of the body or on
which<00:02:52.150> cells<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> morning<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.859> LH

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
which cells of the morning now the LH

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.569 
which cells of the morning now the LH
hormone<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.810> utilizing<00:02:56.560> hormone<00:02:57.010> acts<00:02:57.280> on

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
hormone of the utilizing hormone acts on

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.119 
hormone of the utilizing hormone acts on
the<00:02:57.730> living<00:02:58.239> cells<00:02:58.569> now<00:02:59.109> water<00:02:59.319> lading<00:02:59.829> cells

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
the living cells now water lading cells

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.479 
the living cells now water lading cells
the<00:03:00.519> cells<00:03:00.849> which<00:03:01.150> are<00:03:01.299> present<00:03:01.750> inside<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
the cells which are present inside the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.399 
the cells which are present inside the
testers<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.849> interstitial<00:03:04.689> spaces<00:03:05.019> right

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
testers in the interstitial spaces right

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.670 
testers in the interstitial spaces right
so<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.950> living<00:03:06.310> cells<00:03:06.639> are<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.680> interstitial

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
so the living cells are the interstitial

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.649 
so the living cells are the interstitial
cells<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.739> FSH<00:03:12.400> hormone<00:03:12.609> acts<00:03:13.180> on<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
cells and the FSH hormone acts on the

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.020 
cells and the FSH hormone acts on the
sertoli<00:03:14.199> cells<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.889> remember<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.459> Allah<00:03:15.699> says

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
sertoli cells you remember so Allah says

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.539 
sertoli cells you remember so Allah says
these<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.780> Dolly<00:03:17.260> cells<00:03:17.560> also<00:03:17.949> form<00:03:18.459> the

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
these are Dolly cells also form the

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.789 
these are Dolly cells also form the
inner<00:03:18.849> lining<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.449> the<00:03:19.629> seminiferous<00:03:19.959> tubules

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
inner lining of the seminiferous tubules

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.520 
inner lining of the seminiferous tubules
they<00:03:21.280> provide<00:03:21.729> nourishment<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> male

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
they provide nourishment to the male

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.830 
they provide nourishment to the male
germ<00:03:23.949> cells<00:03:24.310> which<00:03:24.579> actually<00:03:25.030> produce<00:03:25.209> forms

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
germ cells which actually produce forms

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.830 
germ cells which actually produce forms
so<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:26.680> talked<00:03:26.919> about<00:03:27.370> these<00:03:27.760> two<00:03:27.849> cells<00:03:28.389> now

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
so we talked about these two cells now

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.379 
so we talked about these two cells now
one<00:03:29.139> of<00:03:29.169> these<00:03:29.530> hormones<00:03:29.949> that<00:03:30.099> is<00:03:30.220> LH<00:03:30.639> axon<00:03:31.180> is

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
one of these hormones that is LH axon is

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.710 
one of these hormones that is LH axon is
rating<00:03:31.750> cells<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.260> FSH<00:03:32.859> axon<00:03:33.549> sertoli<00:03:34.329> sense

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
rating cells and FSH axon sertoli sense

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.589 
rating cells and FSH axon sertoli sense
so<00:03:34.989> what<00:03:35.139> happens<00:03:35.560> due<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:36.010> okay<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.449> this

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
so what happens due to that okay so this

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.539 
so what happens due to that okay so this
is<00:03:37.780> where<00:03:37.989> we<00:03:38.229> are<00:03:38.349> so<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.979> these<00:03:39.159> are<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
is where we are so this is these are the

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.849 
is where we are so this is these are the
seminiferous<00:03:39.879> tubules<00:03:40.629> and<00:03:40.780> inside<00:03:41.229> the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
seminiferous tubules and inside the

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.670 
seminiferous tubules and inside the
inner<00:03:42.069> lining<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.699> Senecas<00:03:43.419> to<00:03:43.780> use<00:03:44.079> we<00:03:44.650> have

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
inner lining of Senecas to use we have

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.969 
inner lining of Senecas to use we have
the<00:03:45.519> sertoli<00:03:46.000> cells<00:03:46.479> and<00:03:46.750> where<00:03:47.139> we<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
the sertoli cells and where we have the

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.939 
the sertoli cells and where we have the
latex<00:03:48.400> s<00:03:48.609> we<00:03:49.120> have<00:03:49.389> them<00:03:49.780> in<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.169> interstitial

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
latex s we have them in the interstitial

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.569 
latex s we have them in the interstitial
spaces<00:03:51.729> so<00:03:52.510> there<00:03:52.720> we<00:03:53.049> have<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.579> linking

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
spaces so there we have the linking

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.409 
spaces so there we have the linking
cells<00:03:55.739> right<00:03:56.739> now<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.729> also<00:03:57.939> learned

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
cells right now we have also learned

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.319 
cells right now we have also learned
what<00:03:58.930> will<00:03:59.859> they<00:04:00.010> do<00:04:00.069> so<00:04:00.489> what<00:04:01.060> will<00:04:01.299> happen

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
what will they do so what will happen

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.319 
what will they do so what will happen
with<00:04:01.900> these<00:04:02.049> organs<00:04:02.620> act<00:04:02.859> on<00:04:03.069> these<00:04:03.280> cells<00:04:03.609> let

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
with these organs act on these cells let

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.899 
with these organs act on these cells let
us<00:04:04.479> have<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.900> quick<00:04:05.199> look<00:04:05.260> again<00:04:05.979> so<00:04:06.729> now<00:04:06.849> the

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
us have a quick look again so now the

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.789 
us have a quick look again so now the
living<00:04:07.449> cells<00:04:07.750> are<00:04:08.049> responsible<00:04:08.470> for

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
living cells are responsible for

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.309 
living cells are responsible for
synthesis<00:04:09.579> and<00:04:09.759> secretion<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:10.359> androgens

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
synthesis and secretion of androgens

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.140 
synthesis and secretion of androgens
so<00:04:11.500> when<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.860> hormone<00:04:12.340> acts<00:04:12.549> on<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.939> it

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
so when this hormone acts on the it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.420 
so when this hormone acts on the it
excels<00:04:13.629> a<00:04:13.810> lot<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.409> anger<00:04:14.769> region<00:04:15.069> will<00:04:15.280> get

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
excels a lot of anger region will get

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.249 
excels a lot of anger region will get
produced<00:04:15.819> because<00:04:16.329> this<00:04:16.600> hormone<00:04:17.079> will

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
produced because this hormone will

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.319 
produced because this hormone will
stimulate<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.829> synthesis<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.669> production

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
stimulate the synthesis and production

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.719 
stimulate the synthesis and production
of<00:04:19.500> androgens<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.620> want<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.130> add<00:04:21.250> water<00:04:21.489> and

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
of androgens and want to add water and

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.129 
of androgens and want to add water and
proteins<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.539> regions<00:04:23.289> they<00:04:23.740> control<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
proteins and regions they control the

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.740 
proteins and regions they control the
sexual<00:04:26.139> behavior<00:04:26.350> on<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.639> secondary<00:04:28.240> sexual

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
sexual behavior on the secondary sexual

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.439 
sexual behavior on the secondary sexual
and<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.410> male<00:04:29.620> sexual<00:04:30.190> accessory<00:04:30.820> ducts<00:04:31.270> and

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
and the male sexual accessory ducts and

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.960 
and the male sexual accessory ducts and
glands<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.289> it<00:04:32.440> controls<00:04:32.830> all<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.580> so

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
glands so it controls all of that so

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.760 
glands so it controls all of that so
basically<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.509> controls<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.110> functioning<00:04:35.620> of

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
basically it controls the functioning of

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.710 
basically it controls the functioning of
the<00:04:35.919> male<00:04:36.100> reproductive<00:04:36.250> system<00:04:36.789> so<00:04:37.509> more<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the male reproductive system so more and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.659 
the male reproductive system so more and
more<00:04:37.930> language<00:04:38.500> instead<00:04:38.889> produced<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.639> is

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
more language instead produced that is

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.879 
more language instead produced that is
testosterone<00:04:40.150> get<00:04:40.750> produced<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.740> what

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
testosterone get produced so what

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.159 
testosterone get produced so what
happens<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.520> secondary<00:04:43.090> sexual<00:04:43.539> hang-ups

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
happens the secondary sexual hang-ups

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.310 
happens the secondary sexual hang-ups
are<00:04:44.380> observed<00:04:44.740> in<00:04:44.860> brain<00:04:45.130> at<00:04:45.520> puberty

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
are observed in brain at puberty

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.719 
are observed in brain at puberty
similarly<00:04:47.320> what<00:04:47.500> happens<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.099> the<00:04:48.220> circle

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
similarly what happens to the circle

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.719 
similarly what happens to the circle
this<00:04:49.389> in<00:04:49.599> turn<00:04:49.979> stimulates<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.099> process<00:04:51.580> of

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
this in turn stimulates the process of

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.930 
this in turn stimulates the process of
spermatogenesis<00:04:52.320> because<00:04:53.320> all<00:04:53.590> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
spermatogenesis because all the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.279 
spermatogenesis because all the
reproductive<00:04:54.940> parts<00:04:55.389> tend<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.960> become<00:04:56.110> more

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
reproductive parts tend to become more

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.999 
reproductive parts tend to become more
active<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:57.419> spermatogenesis<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:59.009> stimulated

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
active so spermatogenesis is stimulated

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.820 
active so spermatogenesis is stimulated
so<00:05:00.220> when<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:00.639> hormone<00:05:01.210> is<00:05:01.330> secreted

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
so when this hormone is secreted

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.070 
so when this hormone is secreted
spermatogenesis<00:05:02.830> is<00:05:03.389> stimulated<00:05:04.389> now<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:05.020> a

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
spermatogenesis is stimulated now in a

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.890 
spermatogenesis is stimulated now in a
very<00:05:05.199> similar<00:05:05.620> way<00:05:05.979> what<00:05:06.220> happens<00:05:06.699> with<00:05:06.910> the

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
very similar way what happens with the

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.980 
very similar way what happens with the
FSH<00:05:08.470> action<00:05:09.039> sir<00:05:09.250> no<00:05:09.430> he<00:05:09.610> says<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:10.270> stimulates

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
FSH action sir no he says it stimulates

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.770 
FSH action sir no he says it stimulates
the<00:05:11.110> process<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.710> spermatogenesis

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
the process of spermatogenesis

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.450 
the process of spermatogenesis
what<00:05:13.780> does<00:05:13.960> Fermi<00:05:14.349> ordinances<00:05:14.949> just<00:05:15.250> in<00:05:15.370> the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
what does Fermi ordinances just in the

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.490 
what does Fermi ordinances just in the
previous<00:05:15.639> slide<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.330> QWERTY<00:05:16.750> write<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
previous slide and QWERTY write the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.490 
previous slide and QWERTY write the
transformation<00:05:18.159> of<00:05:18.550> spermatids<00:05:19.360> into<00:05:20.139> spawns

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
transformation of spermatids into spawns

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.750 
transformation of spermatids into spawns
so<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.430> happens<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.419> sertoli<00:05:22.930> setbacks

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
so that happens in the sertoli setbacks

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.520 
so that happens in the sertoli setbacks
transformation<00:05:24.760> requires<00:05:24.970> some<00:05:25.630> input<00:05:26.500> from

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
transformation requires some input from

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.770 
transformation requires some input from
the<00:05:26.919> sertoli<00:05:27.280> cells<00:05:27.699> so<00:05:28.120> when<00:05:28.270> these<00:05:28.510> hormones

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
the sertoli cells so when these hormones

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.290 
the sertoli cells so when these hormones
act<00:05:29.260> on<00:05:29.409> the<00:05:29.530> sertoli<00:05:29.889> cells<00:05:30.310> this<00:05:30.639> process<00:05:31.150> is

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
act on the sertoli cells this process is

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.770 
act on the sertoli cells this process is
also<00:05:31.510> stimulated<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.830> spiral<00:05:33.280> are<00:05:33.400> janessa

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
also stimulated so spiral are janessa

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.060 
also stimulated so spiral are janessa
spermatogenesis<00:05:34.780> want<00:05:35.169> they<00:05:35.320> start<00:05:35.650> taking

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
spermatogenesis want they start taking

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.520 
spermatogenesis want they start taking
place<00:05:36.250> at<00:05:36.460> puberty<00:05:37.150> so<00:05:37.840> now<00:05:37.960> let<00:05:38.199> us<00:05:38.229> quickly

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
place at puberty so now let us quickly

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.070 
place at puberty so now let us quickly
have<00:05:38.949> a<00:05:39.190> look<00:05:39.220> at<00:05:39.699> where<00:05:40.210> these<00:05:40.539> cells<00:05:40.810> are

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
have a look at where these cells are

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.379 
have a look at where these cells are
actually<00:05:41.169> located<00:05:41.889> so<00:05:42.580> let<00:05:42.729> us<00:05:42.760> quickly<00:05:43.090> look

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
actually located so let us quickly look

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.010 
actually located so let us quickly look
at<00:05:43.659> the<00:05:43.720> cross-section<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.590> them<00:05:45.690> say<00:05:46.690> meaning

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
at the cross-section of them say meaning

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.700 
at the cross-section of them say meaning
esteem

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
esteem

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.830 
esteem
so<00:05:48.190> in<00:05:48.310> this<00:05:48.490> noggin<00:05:48.760> if<00:05:49.000> arrows<00:05:49.300> tip<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.720> will

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
so in this noggin if arrows tip you will

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.290 
so in this noggin if arrows tip you will
you<00:05:50.080> can<00:05:50.229> actually<00:05:50.500> see<00:05:51.039> so<00:05:51.789> you<00:05:51.849> can<00:05:52.090> actually

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
you can actually see so you can actually

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.560 
you can actually see so you can actually
see<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:52.990> main<00:05:53.370> germ<00:05:54.370> cells<00:05:54.760> now<00:05:55.030> as<00:05:55.090> I<00:05:55.330> said

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
see the main germ cells now as I said

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.500 
see the main germ cells now as I said
that<00:05:55.780> in<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:56.080> noggin<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.949> us<00:05:57.250> Emily<00:05:57.580> festival<00:05:58.330> is

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
that in a noggin of us Emily festival is

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.850 
that in a noggin of us Emily festival is
formed<00:05:58.900> by<00:05:59.050> two<00:05:59.199> types<00:05:59.590> of<00:05:59.800> cells<00:06:00.039> one<00:06:00.639> is<00:06:00.820> the

you<00:06:13.730> see<00:06:13.970> his<00:06:14.570> on<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:15.490> startling<00:06:16.490> sets<00:06:17.150> where

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
you see his on the startling sets where

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.990 
you see his on the startling sets where
is<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.139> other<00:06:18.320> sense<00:06:18.740> which<00:06:18.980> you<00:06:19.190> see<00:06:19.430> they

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
is the other sense which you see they

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.210 
is the other sense which you see they
are<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.240> million<00:06:21.230> children<00:06:21.560> cells<00:06:21.889> or

now<00:06:30.950> from<00:06:31.280> these<00:06:31.460> main<00:06:31.850> germ<00:06:32.210> cells<00:06:32.600> primary

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
now from these main germ cells primary

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.100 
now from these main germ cells primary
spermatocytes<00:06:34.400> are<00:06:34.730> formed<00:06:35.210> so<00:06:35.330> these<00:06:35.720> cells

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
spermatocytes are formed so these cells

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.920 
spermatocytes are formed so these cells
which<00:06:36.380> are<00:06:36.530> formed<00:06:36.980> here<00:06:37.220> they<00:06:37.730> ascribe<00:06:38.330> is<00:06:38.660> a

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
which are formed here they ascribe is a

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.080 
which are formed here they ascribe is a
phagocyte<00:06:39.250> again<00:06:40.250> from<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.610> primary

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
phagocyte again from the primary

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.129 
phagocyte again from the primary
spermatocytes

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
spermatocytes

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.340 
spermatocytes
secondary<00:06:42.980> spermatocytes<00:06:43.250> are<00:06:44.240> formed<00:06:44.750> so

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
secondary spermatocytes are formed so

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.440 
secondary spermatocytes are formed so
these<00:06:45.530> are<00:06:45.890> secondary<00:06:46.700> spread<00:06:47.540> by<00:06:47.750> oocyte<00:06:48.260> and

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
these are secondary spread by oocyte and

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.180 
these are secondary spread by oocyte and
from<00:06:50.450> the<00:06:50.630> secondary<00:06:51.169> spermatocytes

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
from the secondary spermatocytes

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.240 
from the secondary spermatocytes
but<00:06:52.610> my<00:06:52.850> dreams<00:06:53.180> are<00:06:53.510> form<00:06:53.870> so<00:06:54.320> here<00:06:54.470> using<00:06:54.680> dot

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
but my dreams are form so here using dot

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.790 
but my dreams are form so here using dot
length<00:06:55.520> structures<00:06:56.090> so<00:06:56.600> they<00:06:56.780> are<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.410> sperm

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
length structures so they are the sperm

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.659 
length structures so they are the sperm
angles

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
angles

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.380 
angles
i'm<00:06:59.630> from<00:07:00.350> the<00:07:00.530> sperm<00:07:00.800> and<00:07:00.980> it's<00:07:01.280> spawns<00:07:01.970> are

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
i'm from the sperm and it's spawns are

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.719 
i'm from the sperm and it's spawns are
formed<00:07:02.810> so<00:07:02.870> you<00:07:03.169> can<00:07:03.590> see<00:07:03.890> these<00:07:04.490> are<00:07:04.700> the

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729 
formed so you can see these are the

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.360 
formed so you can see these are the
spawns<00:07:05.479> so<00:07:05.900> you<00:07:05.960> see<00:07:06.260> that<00:07:06.440> actually<00:07:06.650> the

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
spawns so you see that actually the

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.100 
spawns so you see that actually the
cells<00:07:07.669> which<00:07:07.940> produce<00:07:07.970> ponds<00:07:08.750> they<00:07:09.020> are

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
cells which produce ponds they are

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.230 
cells which produce ponds they are
located<00:07:09.380> on<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:09.710> belt<00:07:09.919> very<00:07:10.220> and<00:07:10.610> find<00:07:11.060> these

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
located on the belt very and find these

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.570 
located on the belt very and find these
forms<00:07:11.690> are<00:07:11.840> formed<00:07:12.320> with<00:07:12.410> the<00:07:12.440> human<00:07:12.950> so<00:07:13.430> this

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
forms are formed with the human so this

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.850 
forms are formed with the human so this
is<00:07:13.760> how<00:07:13.970> sperms<00:07:14.389> are<00:07:14.630> from<00:07:14.960> inside<00:07:15.410> this<00:07:15.590> tube

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
is how sperms are from inside this tube

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.620 
is how sperms are from inside this tube
you<00:07:16.010> know<00:07:16.220> where<00:07:16.639> are<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:17.000> leading<00:07:17.210> cells

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
you know where are the leading cells

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.540 
you know where are the leading cells
located<00:07:17.840> letting<00:07:18.530> cells<00:07:18.800> are<00:07:18.919> located<00:07:19.040> in<00:07:19.430> the
