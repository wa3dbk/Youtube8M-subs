really<00:00:50.840> fun<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.410> really<00:00:51.650> playing<00:00:52.070> with<00:00:52.430> the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
really fun is really playing with the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.530 
really fun is really playing with the
terrain<00:00:54.309> but<00:00:55.309> sometimes<00:00:55.760> I<00:00:55.940> like<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.120> feel

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
terrain but sometimes I like to feel

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.979 
terrain but sometimes I like to feel
almost<00:00:57.199> like<00:00:57.530> I'm<00:00:57.710> matching<00:00:58.280> my<00:00:58.460> skiing<00:00:58.989> the

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
almost like I'm matching my skiing the

tactical approach you know these shorter

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.760 
tactical approach you know these shorter
turns<00:01:34.700> right<00:01:35.030> here<00:01:35.359> to<00:01:36.109> move<00:01:36.289> down<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.469> middle

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
turns right here to move down the middle

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.380 
turns right here to move down the middle
of<00:01:36.859> the<00:01:36.950> run<00:01:37.159> it's<00:01:37.340> kind<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.579> fun<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.969> play<00:01:38.000> with

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390
