00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
nozzle anymore sense but whatever that's

the<00:02:56.310> price<00:02:56.489> we're<00:02:56.700> working<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.769> they

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
the price we're working with they

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.680 
the price we're working with they
produce<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.090> point<00:03:00.360> where<00:03:00.599> the

four and they stop they don't make any
more<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.549> because<00:03:05.940> they<00:03:06.510> cost<00:03:06.780> more<00:03:07.019> than<00:03:07.170> they

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
more up because they cost more than they

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.160 
more up because they cost more than they
can<00:03:07.980> sell<00:03:08.340> them<00:03:08.549> for<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:09.540> they<00:03:09.840> don't<00:03:09.989> make

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
can sell them for and they don't make

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.069 
can sell them for and they don't make
less<00:03:10.470> because<00:03:11.069> they<00:03:11.280> think<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:12.720> each<00:03:13.049> of

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the croissant is greater than the cost

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.960 
the croissant is greater than the cost

here the workers they need the marginal
workers<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.900> they'll<00:03:40.139> need<00:03:40.319> marginal<00:03:41.280> cost

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.440 
then they stopped here at fifteen ninety
four<00:03:55.700> what<00:03:56.700> happens<00:03:57.000> when<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.180> change<00:03:57.329> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
four what happens when you change the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.099 
four what happens when you change the
wage<00:03:57.690> rates<00:03:57.989> well<00:03:58.769> change<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.459> wage<00:03:59.639> rates

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
wage rates well change the wage rates

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.910 
wage rates well change the wage rates
suddenly<00:04:02.450> workers<00:04:03.450> are<00:04:03.690> more<00:04:03.959> expensive<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
suddenly workers are more expensive the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.490 
suddenly workers are more expensive the
marginal<00:04:05.310> course<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.760> higher<00:04:06.200> what<00:04:07.200> happens

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
marginal course is higher what happens

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.289 
marginal course is higher what happens
it<00:04:07.560> make<00:04:07.769> workers<00:04:08.250> more<00:04:08.400> productive<00:04:08.459> they<00:04:09.150> can

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
it make workers more productive they can

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.360 
it make workers more productive they can
make<00:04:09.450> more<00:04:09.599> croissants<00:04:10.200> well<00:04:10.889> suddenly<00:04:11.130> you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
make more croissants well suddenly you

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.979 
make more croissants well suddenly you
don't<00:04:11.519> need<00:04:11.760> as<00:04:11.940> many<00:04:12.060> workers<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.660> need<00:04:12.870> to

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
don't need as many workers you need to

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.900 
don't need as many workers you need to
point<00:04:13.260> one<00:04:13.530> five<00:04:13.769> workers<00:04:14.250> instead<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.700> point

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
point one five workers instead of point

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.940 
point one five workers instead of point
two<00:04:15.060> point<00:04:15.750> three<00:04:15.959> five<00:04:16.139> workers<00:04:16.470> for<00:04:16.799> two

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
two point three five workers for two

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.710 
two point three five workers for two
croissants<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:19.430> other<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.700> modular<00:04:20.940> instead

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
croissants in other it's modular instead

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.060 
croissants in other it's modular instead
of<00:04:21.810> 0.47

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.210 
of 0.47
it<00:04:23.660> point<00:04:24.660> six<00:04:24.960> one<00:04:25.230> instead<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.860> point<00:04:26.070> eight

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
it point six one instead of point eight

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.020 
it point six one instead of point eight
two<00:04:26.480> so<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.570> marginal<00:04:28.050> work<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> less
