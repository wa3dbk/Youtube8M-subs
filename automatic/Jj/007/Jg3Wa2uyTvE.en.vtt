00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 - Good night my role is attacking is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.120
 only attacker likes to play as an attacker 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.139
 but as I said in my 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 presentation here that I came to help 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 and to help where Jorge does not 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.340
 You need me, I'm at his disposal. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 to see how I spoke to my end with a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.320
 attacker but if you need me on 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.810
 side I will certainly look for 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.769
 work hard and help the team 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.000
 best possible way 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 I only know that I came in the fifth 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.410
 piracicaba the act in a little on the side 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.540
 right he played I started as an attacker 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.219
 as lateral was injured with an injury 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 very serious and was left out 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.530
 the teacher who was commanding the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 team fought for me I could help in the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 side 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 I helped a lot and managed to adapt 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.110
 but my strong same consignee not 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 imagine but we are always in the day to day 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.489
 has been working hard 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.980
 Professor Jorge was realizing this. 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.750
 that's why I live hard trying then 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.820
 It's how I discussed it with my family. 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.490
 at home with my friends 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.310
 It's the opportunity of my big life. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.700
 too much to be able to change my life 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.799
 of my family and I hope to 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 closely correspond with certainty 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.110
 that player does not have that dream of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.070
 play in the maracanã even more wearing the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 flamingo shirt 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 We hope to regain the cup. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 Confederations 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.189
 playing maracanã and playing again in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 home to the Flemish again is better 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 bigger than I imagined, right? 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 my first call instead of outside 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.150
 no training we did the day before 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.430
 of the game I saw the heat of the fans 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.710
 If there was no training the crowd filled the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.920
 Stadium and I was thinking 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.990
 imagine in the game how it's going to be despite 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.680
 game on the outside judge is imagining 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.729
 here in the river game as being in maracanã 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.619
 how should be 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.500
 not people debuted well against the saints 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.890
 only one goal was missed and the only goal was missing 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.379
 against the saints against the weight of others 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.370
 Brazilian beach games is just as well 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.129
 disputed 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.659
 We have to always be fine but we do not have to. 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.170
 happen in my point of view 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:22.379
 Comes well, some errors are happening. 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.209
 But it's during training, you can still 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.690
 to hit the people gives to recover in the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.540
 championship 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.659
 It's the majority of the team today, you do not have to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.239
 patience to work the ball and reach 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.360
 well within the area to be able to finalize 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.860
 We're good at this, I'm fine. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.930
 missing just a little bit of 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.780
 calm down and work the ball near the area 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.459
 I certainly got scared in this game. 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.859
 with the athletic paranaense 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.959
 I counted only on the athletic crowd 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.519
 but when I entered the field in half 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.670
 It was Flemish stadium. 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.560
 that motivated me even more and now I saw 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.819
 Anywhere we play will go. 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.909
 have a flamenco fan we go 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.400
 to play as if at home will appear 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:06.090
 the group a good group that we have in 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.940
 hockenheim high level player like 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.150
 as holder as a reserve then in the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.489
 case of marcelo moretto hernanes that are 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.829
 two excellent center-backs in the same 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.560
 level of the two without comparison 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.459
 if some areas have the wing have the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.269
 frash there are provided here can 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.359
 help people 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.750
 Our goal was to premiere well premiered with 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.230
 draw but if not now happened to 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.609
 people 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.190
 the expectation is great for us 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.549
 win these two game free - kick 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.269
 break and we go back in after after 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.760
 already well 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.049
 with those three dots these six 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.799
 points you have to dispute people 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.799
 I do not know
