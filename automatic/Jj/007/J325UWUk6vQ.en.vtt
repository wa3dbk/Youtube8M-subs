00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.999 
be still on 64 1.3 but if i get a new
device<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> future<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.079> stuff<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
device in the future and stuff like a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
device in the future and stuff like a
5th<00:02:02.399> gen<00:02:02.640> ipod<00:02:03.000> touch<00:02:03.240> i<00:02:04.070> will<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> iOS<00:02:06.060> 7

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
5th gen ipod touch i will be on iOS 7

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.809 
5th gen ipod touch i will be on iOS 7
and<00:02:06.659> i<00:02:07.560> probably<00:02:07.740> won't<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.069> uploading<00:02:08.280> but

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and i probably won't be uploading but

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.910 
and i probably won't be uploading but
whenever<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> compatibility<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
whenever they get the compatibility and

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250 
whenever they get the compatibility and
so<00:02:11.099> here's<00:02:11.819> how<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.060> build<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.300> heart<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.750> guess

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so here's how you build a heart I guess

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.510 
so here's how you build a heart I guess
this<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> be

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
this is going to be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.260 
this is going to be
you're<00:02:14.640> gonna<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.970> make<00:02:15.090> this

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you're gonna have to make this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.660 
you're gonna have to make this
symmetrical<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> place<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.550> can

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
symmetrical so you place one and you can

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.580 
symmetrical so you place one and you can
also<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.570> floor<00:02:18.780> too<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.380> can<00:02:19.500> do

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
also do this on the floor too you can do

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.520 
also do this on the floor too you can do

to cover in the zero point seven point

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.529 
to cover in the zero point seven point
four<00:04:37.080> update<00:04:37.229> was<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.190> new<00:04:38.310> ayotte<00:04:38.880> was<00:04:39.300> new

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
four update was the new ayotte was new

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.850 
four update was the new ayotte was new
UI<00:04:39.840> because<00:04:40.650> now<00:04:42.110> because<00:04:43.110> now<00:04:43.349> when<00:04:43.770> you

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
UI because now because now when you

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.589 
UI because now because now when you
break<00:04:44.069> blocks<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.669> that<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.030> kind<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.389> is

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
break blocks like that it kind of is

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.980 
break blocks like that it kind of is
something<00:04:46.440> like<00:04:46.560> PC<00:04:47.599> like<00:04:48.599> when<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.840> break

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
something like PC like when you break

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.930 
something like PC like when you break
blocks<00:04:49.319> it's<00:04:49.710> kind<00:04:49.979> of<00:04:50.039> making<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.490> griefing

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
blocks it's kind of making the griefing

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.809 
blocks it's kind of making the griefing
a<00:04:51.210> little<00:04:51.720> bit<00:04:51.840> more<00:04:52.460> intense<00:04:53.460> i<00:04:53.610> guess

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
a little bit more intense i guess

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.480 
a little bit more intense i guess
because<00:04:54.500> because<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.530> how<00:04:55.770> they<00:04:55.919> changed<00:04:56.340> the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
because because of how they changed the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.390 
because because of how they changed the
block<00:04:57.500> Breaking<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.590> creative<00:04:59.159> so<00:04:59.550> yeah<00:04:59.580> um

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
block Breaking and creative so yeah um
