00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello to all these measures that 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.600
 by the way who is speaking to you for new 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.500
 video dedicated to the time of the advent 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.679
 legal prince we were going to December 21st 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 so we will open the box of 20h sub 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.289
 so without further ado donges recalled 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 yesterday they are beautiful 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.240
 flowers and plants a tiny plan 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 on the other hand 1 2 x 3 no more and no less 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.760
 to listen to north france today what 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.789
 that we are not going any more 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 themes of the Christmas universe or not 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:42.840
 what are that everybody is asking or 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:50.309
 not so we'll see that right away and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.680
 wau finally from the most construction 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.660
 building all the way up 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.329
 present because actually we are going 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.010
 build a chimney a chimney that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.229
 makes the good taste of not being pink 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.060
 so damascus what a pretty good point 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:16.320
 I want to say so when we 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:19.040
 borrows two pieces 2 x 2 ok so two 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:27.530
 times right then once grease 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.530
 grid- shaped like this ok so 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.619
 once 4 - board on it i'm going 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.780
 have to box their was waiting for them because he 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:45.390
 there are plenty of setbacks 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:48.570
 it's weird that's ok an orange piece a 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.360
 brown piece to make wood and new 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.780
 orange room for serving fire like this 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.780
 then I take two but once a 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:19.879
 at that level cost to be once of 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:24.760
 time you inverted we recased once 4 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:28.840
 to support all of two times 2 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 how this is 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.579
 in the front we are going to be this two piece 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.519
 once a like this here and it's not 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.040
 finished because actually we will put some 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.090
 small decorations in particular with 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:57.250
 flower parts we have to 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:03:01.549
 now what are you the chimney of course 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.160
 dancers like a garland I think and 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.620
 to the millions who will be a little a 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 times a hellish round difference 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.970
 it's according to the web town hall so what is 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.349
 what we have left over they go to this 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.079
 than once he breaks an orange 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:19.959
 trans a red a mare jobs 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.959
 available as well as a flower 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.200
 so this is what we have 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.459
 so is ultimately nothing just manage your 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.750
 arm the little fireplace so in fact I 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.549
 realize that I screwed up 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.260
 cathos right in the middle on the hearth of the 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.290
 fire that's what I thought so 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.819
 I guess the chimney must go there 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.190
 in front of the cage in the cable 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.810
 times like life laughs in the end 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.010
 so by cons it's the security 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.150
 made this house because it does not 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.139
 full of elements and where for the first 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.450
 1/2 final I have almost no place me 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.099
 for you everything you eat 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.720
 squarely beside there the dog's basket 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.889
 dirty hardcore that besides I did I 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.889
 sleep all viallet all clubs for 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.209
 football for which 10 24 yes more 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.310
 what of his full middle of the door 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.020
 entry in but frankly what is it 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.870
 it 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.730
 embroiderer we do not know whether to accuse 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.650
 the architect or the interior decoration 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.880
 on the spot but in any case there is a 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.680
 faulty in the story I tell you 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.230
 say so here is fireplace as everything to 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.130
 blow one in the hands build that 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.010
 in the spirit of Christmas 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.400
 so it's pretty cool listen I 'm 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.360
 not from 21 rather hello or rather 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.160
 see again here and your long and 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.840
 to taste I think that's all it does 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.490
 stays more than three days before 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.900
 big day 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.220
 I like to repeat myself and we go 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.290
 stop long namely February 1 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.970
 I opened the box of the 22nd logically and 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.010
 so pending questions comments 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.020
 go ahead and have fun in it's the 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.190
 party is soon Christmas and then no 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.290
 payment we end up for one 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.290
