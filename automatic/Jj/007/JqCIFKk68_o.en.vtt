00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.830
 the windjammer parade 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.250
 since 1998 the maritime highlight of the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.250
 Kiel Week 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.430
 a tryst of full ships 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.890
 Bar alleys back end them gaff 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.020
 nice hanse cooking and hundreds 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.970
 of sailing yachts that are tall ships 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.450
 still the queens on the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.450
 seven seas 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.960
 every tall ship leads a group 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.280
 small ships and leads them with four 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 knots in the outer fjord 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.030
 over 100,000 spectators lined the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.500
 beaches of the fjord and settled also 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.650
 from a storm the fun not 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.650
 spoil 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.850
 windjammer that sounds like a sailor 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.170
 romance storm high waves hard 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.660
 work and howl in the shrouds but what 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 Windjammer really means wind 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.480
 in the sailing laments for me is the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.710
 the term for the old sailing ships 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.330
 Ran up storm legs after the wind that 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 The winter sailors have enough to complain about 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.550
 of course that has nothing to do with the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.740
 Wind pressure translates, so to speak, the pressure 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.900
 in the sails 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.910
 The weather was short when arriving 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.910
 almost imperial weather prevailed
