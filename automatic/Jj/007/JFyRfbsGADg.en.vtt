00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
they're like there's like the space

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.910 
they're like there's like the space
station<00:03:09.630> they're<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.230> satellites<00:03:10.740> like

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
station they're the satellites like

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.400 
station they're the satellites like
they're<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:11.850> finally<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.540> earth<00:03:12.870> shook<00:03:13.170> but

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
they're like finally the earth shook but

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.860 
they're like finally the earth shook but
then<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.709> was<00:03:13.830> quiet<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.550> then<00:03:15.000> out<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:15.750> it's

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
then it was quiet and then out here it's

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.920 
then it was quiet and then out here it's
like<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:17.040> concluded

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
like to be concluded

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.870 
like to be concluded
so<00:03:18.930> yeah<00:03:19.320> I'm<00:03:19.560> guessing<00:03:19.739> with<00:03:20.040> because<00:03:20.850> of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
so yeah I'm guessing with because of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.040 
so yeah I'm guessing with because of
that<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.390> thought<00:03:21.630> they<00:03:21.810> were<00:03:21.900> just

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
that you know I thought they were just

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.970 
that you know I thought they were just
going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:23.670> know<00:03:24.170> start<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.260> new<00:03:25.410> series<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
going to you know start a new series the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.370 
going to you know start a new series the
continuation<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.880> one<00:03:27.090> blitz<00:03:27.239> from<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
continuation of this one blitz from the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.870 
continuation of this one blitz from the
way<00:03:28.500> they<00:03:28.650> said<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.160> sounds<00:03:29.610> like<00:03:29.730> it's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
way they said it it sounds like it's

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.640 
way they said it it sounds like it's
quite<00:03:30.000> possible<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.570> next<00:03:31.230> issue<00:03:31.350> might<00:03:31.620> be

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
quite possible that next issue might be

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.220 
quite possible that next issue might be
truly<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.430> last<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:33.000> Kingdom<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.600> monsters<00:03:34.019> I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
was really hoping it wasn't going to be

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.270 
was really hoping it wasn't going to be
but<00:03:38.310> anyway<00:03:38.640> yeah<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.630> next<00:03:40.410> month's<00:03:40.769> issues

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
but anyway yeah the next month's issues

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.850 
but anyway yeah the next month's issues
have<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.209> make<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.660> final<00:03:42.840> Kingdom<00:03:43.739> of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.660 
just hit him with paralyzer missiles and
you<00:04:41.240> know<00:04:41.530> there's<00:04:42.530> just<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.190> much<00:04:43.340> stuff<00:04:43.640> that

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
you know there's just so much stuff that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.770 
you know there's just so much stuff that
they<00:04:43.880> haven't<00:04:44.180> done<00:04:44.330> yet<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:46.640> do<00:04:46.910> still<00:04:47.540> think

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
they haven't done yet I do still think

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.900 
they haven't done yet I do still think
that<00:04:47.840> even<00:04:48.290> though<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.040> did<00:04:49.310> say<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.580> be

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
that even though it did say to be

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.480 
that even though it did say to be
included<00:04:50.420> there<00:04:50.620> is<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.890> possibility<00:04:52.310> that

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
included there is the possibility that

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.160 
included there is the possibility that
it<00:04:52.760> still<00:04:53.000> might<00:04:53.180> be<00:04:53.360> just<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.720> ending<00:04:54.080> of

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
it still might be just the ending of

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.330 
it still might be just the ending of
