the<00:02:26.940> wall<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.080> oh<00:02:31.940> well<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.210> what<00:02:33.740> my

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the wall here oh well you know what my

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.590 
the wall here oh well you know what my
theory<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> cell<00:02:36.000> towers<00:02:36.420> are

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
theory is that the cell towers are

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:48.920 
theory is that the cell towers are
blowing<00:02:37.290> down<00:02:47.060> no<00:02:48.060> I'm<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.300> sure<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.810> we

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
blowing down no I'm not sure of what we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.490 
blowing down no I'm not sure of what we
saw<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.320> tornado<00:02:49.590> or<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.700> gust<00:02:50.940> front

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500

saw was a tornado or just the gust front
it<00:02:52.500> was<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> tornado<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.430> saw<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.360> Sen<00:02:54.870> just

it was a tornado I saw it like Sen just
saying<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.950> was<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.280> NATO<00:02:56.490> i<00:02:57.740> think

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
saying I think it was for NATO i think

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.340 
saying I think it was for NATO i think
it<00:02:58.800> was<00:02:58.860> tornado<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.400> think<00:02:59.700> we<00:02:59.970> show<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:01.140> saw

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
