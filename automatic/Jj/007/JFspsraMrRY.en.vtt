first they were told there would be no

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.870 
first they were told there would be no
problem<00:01:06.220> because<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.610> water<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:08.080> know<00:01:08.200> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
problem because the water you know the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.660 
problem because the water you know the
the<00:01:09.880> where<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.300> intake<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:11.020> 14<00:01:11.470> feet<00:01:12.190> below

the where the intake is 14 feet below
the<00:01:13.270> surface<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:14.140> so<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:14.920> wouldn't<00:01:15.280> pick<00:01:15.550> up

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
the surface and so it wouldn't pick up

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.160 
the surface and so it wouldn't pick up
the<00:01:15.880> oil<00:01:16.030> which<00:01:16.330> would<00:01:16.450> be<00:01:16.570> floating<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:17.050> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
the oil which would be floating to the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.650 
the oil which would be floating to the
top<00:01:17.380> but<00:01:17.500> as<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.770> turns<00:01:17.950> out<00:01:18.160> this<00:01:18.370> is<00:01:18.730> ending

about<00:02:14.830> an<00:02:14.980> hour<00:02:15.190> before<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.390> tasted<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.989> in<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
about an hour before we tasted it in the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.210 
about an hour before we tasted it in the
water<00:02:17.640> there's<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.760> big<00:02:19.120> impact<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.830> water<00:02:21.069> is

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
water there's a big impact the water is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.720 
water there's a big impact the water is
not<00:02:21.340> drinkable<00:02:21.400> at<00:02:22.060> all<00:02:23.099> because<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
not drinkable at all because the the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
not drinkable at all because the the
water<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.959> taken<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.650> river<00:02:26.950> for<00:02:27.730> their

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
water is taken from this river for their

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.699 
water is taken from this river for their
drinking<00:02:28.450> sources<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:29.680> are

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
drinking sources and and there are

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.470 
drinking sources and and there are
several<00:02:30.099> communities<00:02:30.730> downriver

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
several communities downriver

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.430 
several communities downriver
they've<00:02:31.989> already<00:02:32.230> spotted<00:02:33.010> by<00:02:33.970> air<00:02:34.440> oil

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
they've already spotted by air oil

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.070 
they've already spotted by air oil
slicks<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.400> water<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:36.970> far<00:02:37.330> as<00:02:37.420> 60<00:02:37.810> miles

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
slicks on the water as far as 60 miles

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040 
slicks on the water as far as 60 miles
downriver<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:40.330> dishwasher<00:02:40.690> is

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
downriver and so this dishwasher is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.809 
downriver and so this dishwasher is
going<00:02:41.440> downriver<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.069> has<00:02:42.220> not<00:02:42.489> been

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
going downriver it has not been

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.990 
going downriver it has not been
contained<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.890> they're<00:02:44.890> having<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.760> problem

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
contained and they're having a problem

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.370 
contained and they're having a problem
with<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.239> because<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> surface<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.170> river

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
with it because the surface of the river

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.340 
with it because the surface of the river
is<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.769> iced<00:02:48.040> over<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.120> they<00:02:49.330> can't<00:02:49.569> just<00:02:49.810> scoop

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
is is iced over so they can't just scoop

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.500 
is is iced over so they can't just scoop
it<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.620> or<00:02:50.950> suck<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.370> out<00:02:51.519> they<00:02:51.940> can't<00:02:52.209> really

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it up or suck it out they can't really

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.140 
it up or suck it out they can't really
get<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.650> find<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.430> making<00:02:54.850> its

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
get to it and find it so it's making its

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.360 
get to it and find it so it's making its
way<00:02:55.299> downriver<00:02:55.600> into<00:02:56.290> various<00:02:56.890> communities

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
way downriver into various communities

way downriver into various communities
drinking<00:02:57.760> water<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.690> only<00:02:59.250> one<00:03:00.250> example

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
drinking water this is only one example

indications what the proposed cleanup is

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.600 
indications what the proposed cleanup is
gonna<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:13.260> there<00:03:14.260> they're<00:03:14.650> trying<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.220> clean

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
gonna be there they're trying to clean

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.729 
gonna be there they're trying to clean
it<00:03:15.640> up<00:03:15.819> now<00:03:15.880> by<00:03:16.209> poking<00:03:16.510> holes<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.200> ice<00:03:17.230> and

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
it up now by poking holes in the ice and

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.580 
it up now by poking holes in the ice and
and<00:03:18.370> it's<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.329> gonna<00:03:19.450> sucking<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.140> out<00:03:20.320> but

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
and it's not gonna sucking it out but

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.349 
and it's not gonna sucking it out but
they<00:03:20.859> can't<00:03:21.100> see<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.519> they<00:03:21.670> can't<00:03:21.910> tell<00:03:22.150> where

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
they can't see it they can't tell where

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.630 
they can't see it they can't tell where
it<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.690> because<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.380> under<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.040> ice<00:03:24.220> it's

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
it is because it's under the ice it's

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.460 
it is because it's under the ice it's
passing<00:03:25.120> through<00:03:25.150> there<00:03:25.870> they're<00:03:26.200> having

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
passing through there they're having

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.199 
passing through there they're having
trouble<00:03:26.799> with<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.100> they've<00:03:27.370> stopped<00:03:27.820> the

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
trouble with this they've stopped the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.650 
trouble with this they've stopped the
leak<00:03:28.660> but<00:03:29.380> they<00:03:29.500> but<00:03:30.160> they<00:03:31.060> can't<00:03:31.390> tell

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
leak but they but they can't tell

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.690 
leak but they but they can't tell
exactly<00:03:31.870> where<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.440> oil<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.190> may<00:03:33.430> have

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
exactly where the oil is it may have

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.690 
exactly where the oil is it may have
seeped<00:03:34.030> into<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.540> ground<00:03:34.690> itself<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.920> rather

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
seeped into the ground itself and rather

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.789 
seeped into the ground itself and rather
than<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.030> floating<00:03:37.660> downriver<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.560> may<00:03:38.739> be

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
than just floating downriver it may be

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.270 
than just floating downriver it may be
in<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.819> ground<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.350> it's<00:03:41.590> coming<00:03:42.069> up

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
in the ground and so that it's coming up

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280 
in the ground and so that it's coming up
gradually<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.019> small

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
gradually this is just a small

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.990 
gradually this is just a small
indication<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.160> what<00:03:45.310> can<00:03:45.459> happen<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.790> these

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
indication of what can happen to these

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.240 
indication of what can happen to these
communities<00:03:46.600> who<00:03:46.750> rely<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.230> these<00:03:47.769> river

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
communities who rely on these river

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.009 
communities who rely on these river
systems<00:03:48.730> for<00:03:49.030> their<00:03:49.180> water<00:03:49.420> sources<00:03:49.870> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
systems for their water sources and

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.530 
systems for their water sources and
these<00:03:50.769> pipelines<00:03:51.370> are<00:03:51.760> going<00:03:52.150> over<00:03:52.420> there

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
these pipelines are going over there

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.270 
these pipelines are going over there
this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.780> exactly<00:03:53.530> why<00:03:53.769> Keystone<00:03:54.250> XL<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.180> is

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
this is exactly why Keystone XL is is

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.490 
this is exactly why Keystone XL is is
being<00:03:57.280> caused<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.730> potential<00:03:58.269> problem<00:03:58.810> if<00:03:59.319> you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
being caused a potential problem if you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.319 
being caused a potential problem if you
can<00:03:59.650> bring<00:03:59.799> one<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.100> these<00:04:00.220> maps<00:04:00.519> up<00:04:00.760> again<00:04:01.030> to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
can bring one of these maps up again to

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.259 
can bring one of these maps up again to
