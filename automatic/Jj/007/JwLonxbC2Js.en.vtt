00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
wondering if I could build him some of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.420 
wondering if I could build him some of
these<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:30.359> he's<00:00:30.810> gonna<00:00:31.019> he<00:00:31.529> wants<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.070> six

started on it yesterday and this is a
Amish<00:00:39.059> built<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.649> there's<00:00:40.649> uh<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.399> I'm

Amish built one there's uh and I'm

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
Amish built one there's uh and I'm
working<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> wheels<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.440> I'm

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
working on the wheels right now I'm

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.790 
working on the wheels right now I'm
trying<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> figure<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.579> how<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> build<00:00:45.000> them

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
trying to figure out how to build them

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
trying to figure out how to build them
these<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> fourteen<00:00:48.239> spoked

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
these are this is a fourteen spoked

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.069 
these are this is a fourteen spoked
wheel<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> smaller<00:00:53.190> version<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
wheel and this is a smaller version of a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
wheel and this is a smaller version of a
cannon<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> proportions

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
cannon but I really like the proportions

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.830 
cannon but I really like the proportions
of<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:58.379> even<00:00:58.469> said<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
of this one and he even said that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
of this one and he even said that
whoever<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:02.070> cast<00:01:02.370> aluminum

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
whoever this is actually cast aluminum

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
whoever this is actually cast aluminum
this<00:01:03.270> whole<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.870> cast<00:01:04.140> aluminum<00:01:04.320> he

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this whole thing is cast aluminum he

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
this whole thing is cast aluminum he
said<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.640> built<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> early<00:01:06.150> nineteen

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
said it was built in the early nineteen

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.370 
said it was built in the early nineteen
hundred's<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.350> he<00:01:07.830> said<00:01:08.010> whoever<00:01:08.189> built<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
hundred's but he said whoever built it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.950 
hundred's but he said whoever built it
really<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> proportions<00:01:12.119> look<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.810> nice

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
really the proportions look really nice

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560 
really the proportions look really nice
on<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.830> look<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
on this one they look like the the was

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
on this one they look like the the was
booth<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.290> built<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> print<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
booth it was built off of a print and I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
booth it was built off of a print and I
agree<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.020> looks<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.070> look<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
agree that it looks if you look at this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.590 
agree that it looks if you look at this
one<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.900> wheels<00:01:22.610> look<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.030> need

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
one here the wheels look like they need

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
one here the wheels look like they need
to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:25.170> spread<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.220> bit<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to be spread out a little bit more and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
to be spread out a little bit more and
they're<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.869> bit<00:01:27.990> too<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
they're a little bit too big for this

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
they're a little bit too big for this
can<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> looks<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.750> looks<00:01:30.960> like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
can and it looks like it just looks like

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
can and it looks like it just looks like
this<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:33.180> proportioned

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this one here is it's proportioned

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.679 
this one here is it's proportioned
really<00:01:34.079> nice<00:01:34.820> plus<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.970> brought<00:01:36.180> over<00:01:36.210> some

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
really nice plus you brought over some

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.090 
really nice plus you brought over some
prints<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.170> original<00:01:37.590> prints<00:01:37.920> from<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
prints some original prints from the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.789 
prints some original prints from the
Smithsonian<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.049> matches<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.590> real

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
Smithsonian and this one matches up real

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.340 
Smithsonian and this one matches up real
good<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.750> with<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> prints<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
good with that one with the prints so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
good with that one with the prints so
I'm<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.460> ahead<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I'm going to go ahead with this and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.740 
I'm going to go ahead with this and
scale<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.649> version<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:48.149> carry<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
scale this version up to carry this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.190 
scale this version up to carry this
Canon<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.220> multiplier<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.820> like

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
Canon here so the multiplier is like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
Canon here so the multiplier is like
1.25<00:01:52.640> everything<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
1.25 everything you see here is going to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
1.25 everything you see here is going to
be<00:01:54.570> scaled<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.079> by<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.320> factor<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> 1.25<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.549> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
be scaled up by a factor of 1.25 so this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.569 
be scaled up by a factor of 1.25 so this
wheel<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.969> almost<00:02:00.299> 14<00:02:01.009> I'm<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> make<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
wheel is almost 14 I'm going to make it
