level I think there's like 17 or 18 of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.439 
level I think there's like 17 or 18 of
them<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.369> I'm<00:00:17.550> also<00:00:17.789> gonna<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.090> getting<00:00:18.359> them

them and I'm also gonna be getting them
mostly<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.960> order

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.700 

so<00:00:26.179> just<00:00:26.750> as<00:00:26.929> you<00:00:27.080> go<00:00:27.199> through<00:00:27.349> love<00:00:27.529> you'll

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
so just as you go through love you'll

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.950 
so just as you go through love you'll
find<00:00:27.949> them<00:00:28.449> this<00:00:29.449> is<00:00:29.570> one<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.840> more

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
find them this is one of the more

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.650 
find them this is one of the more
confusing<00:00:30.169> levels<00:00:30.949> because<00:00:31.250> there<00:00:31.759> are<00:00:32.000> a<00:00:32.300> ton

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
confusing levels because there are a ton

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.979 
confusing levels because there are a ton
of<00:00:32.689> branching<00:00:33.379> paths<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:34.160> go<00:00:34.340> through<00:00:34.989> but

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
of branching paths to go through but

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.960 
of branching paths to go through but
you'll<00:00:36.739> find<00:00:37.040> as<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.280> go<00:00:37.430> through<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.699> level

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
you'll find as you go through the level

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.660 
you'll find as you go through the level
there's<00:00:38.600> only<00:00:38.809> really<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.590> few<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.309> have<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.579> go

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
there's only really a few you have to go

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:55.930 
there's only really a few you have to go
out<00:00:40.879> of<00:00:41.000> your<00:00:41.030> way<00:00:41.180> for

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.910

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
here's the B there was no margin in the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
here's the B there was no margin in the

to say there's a couple of them you need
the<00:01:09.030> incinerate<00:01:09.750> plasmid<00:01:10.280> just<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the incinerate plasmid just like you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
the incinerate plasmid just like you
needed<00:01:11.730> the<00:01:11.970> telekinesis<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.140> last

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
needed the telekinesis one in the last

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
needed the telekinesis one in the last
video<00:01:13.620> but<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.190> get<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.340> until<00:01:17.910> close
