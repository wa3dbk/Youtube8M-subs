00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.950
 it's weird 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.780
 he himself 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.750
 check for any small ones 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.060
 write or sleep well when you get home 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.510
 cleaning good maintenance as a set 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.510
 long life 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 well fitting bit is incredibly 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 important for the king 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.380
 at first glance , white ones 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 used for the ponies on each other but 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.989
 if you look closely at the white one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.210
 You can see the small differences in that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.110
 we have a bit with the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.210
 bowed up 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.370
 which is generally used to 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.350
 ask for more courtesy in it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.680
 in the middle we have a bed with the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.470
 arched forward in the base more 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.050
 gives freedom for the tongue and over it 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.120
 generally easier for the pony to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.220
 accept the bit on this side 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.410
 have a very special white that stands 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.110
 don't put that up in an arc 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.380
 45 degrees is actually one 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 combination of contact and compliance 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.009
 if you look closely, it is also in curb chain 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350
 small difference here we have the double 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.149
 link and he wins in the middle of the single 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 link single link 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.369
 works in principle slightly sharper than 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 the double links the white ones use 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 for the ponies are all 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.490
 wrapped with that they are a sticker 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.140
 fixed at the front so they don't have any 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 bother getting on the tongue and to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.300
 low all the white ones that I have are special 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.880
 made by letty in consultation with led ip 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.110
 You are always making optimum white for that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.849
 the ponies me has very important that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.470
 bridle fits well 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.330
 it should not be too busy behind the ears 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.399
 give the leather should not be too broad 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 and void or are certainly with small ones 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.330
 ponies that is very important is that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.670
 they get no irritation on that too 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.380
 bit fit is important it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.750
 bit must be able to pivot freely 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.310
 the crowd without movements to the bit 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.030
 I do not have too big it 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.110
 sight 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 nice and quiet to be sure 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.280
 that are clearly a good fit 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.690
 has made my complete home special 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.660
 made for me by henk van de u 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.760
 Belgium 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.010
 well fitting out is probably so 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.780
 important as a good batter you can 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.970
 understand as a good you complete but 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.010
 Tom with the back is eh I have to go 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.140
 draw with a bad fit from that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.270
 what is hindered in his performance as 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.220
 example so very impressive 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.620
 important that the location is good 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.030
 inside is very soft padded it 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 he the absolutely no scuff marks or 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.250
 gets 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.560
 In addition, it is important that it all 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.360
 bottom can shoulder released and attached to the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.580
 top the air at bit or light 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.960
 press 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.580
 Normally trainer always with 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.410
 strange bridles 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.880
 We pack in the last weeks before the World Cup 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.960
 However, the competition bridles 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.850
 to be sure that the 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.430
 bridles are exactly the same as 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.320
 at home in the training with your four-in-hand 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.920
 we have every queen different 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.750
 align the front lines of the front ponies 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.130
 walk back from the front ponies 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.930
 behind they go through the guide so that 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.120
 the rear police head below or the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.800
 can do over with that further to 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 behind the screw 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.510
 so that the line here is not fixed somewhere 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.940
 remains ultimately in the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.330
 key to be attached to the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.330
 back line
