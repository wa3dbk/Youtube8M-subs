regular<00:01:09.560> watering<00:01:09.979> rich<00:01:10.729> soil<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:12.200> little

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
regular watering rich soil and a little

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.679 
regular watering rich soil and a little
support<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.400> hold<00:01:13.549> them<00:01:13.759> up<00:01:13.939> against<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.420> wind

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
support to hold them up against the wind

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.810 
support to hold them up against the wind
and<00:01:14.900> rain<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.320> plants<00:01:16.040> are<00:01:16.189> actually<00:01:16.220> large

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
and rain the plants are actually large

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.060 
and rain the plants are actually large
and<00:01:17.119> vigorous<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.350> they<00:01:18.590> tend<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:18.979> be

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
and vigorous so they tend to be

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.340 
and vigorous so they tend to be
top-heavy<00:01:19.640> that's<00:01:20.330> where<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.659> support<00:01:21.080> comes

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
top-heavy that's where the support comes

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.770 
top-heavy that's where the support comes
in<00:01:21.590> there<00:01:22.370> are<00:01:22.520> metal<00:01:22.850> ones<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.270> just<00:01:23.480> prop

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
in there are metal ones that just prop

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.320 
in there are metal ones that just prop
up<00:01:24.020> individual<00:01:24.680> flowers<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.430> in<00:01:26.000> cutting
