let's<00:00:01.110> start<00:00:01.550> with<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.700> agua<00:00:03.859> and<00:00:04.859> get<00:00:05.130> two<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
let's start with the agua and get two to

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.309 
let's start with the agua and get two to
six<00:00:05.730> ounces<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.180> day<00:00:06.299> roughly<00:00:07.080> speaking

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
six ounces a day roughly speaking

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.740 
six ounces a day roughly speaking
because<00:00:08.280> that's<00:00:08.519> again<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.360> very<00:00:09.599> unique

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
because that's again this is very unique

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.020 
because that's again this is very unique
it<00:00:10.469> does<00:00:10.920> know<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> another<00:00:11.700> unique

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
it does know this is another unique

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.140 
it does know this is another unique
thing<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.509> does<00:00:12.840> not<00:00:13.110> kill<00:00:14.009> healthy<00:00:14.940> bacteria

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
thing it does not kill healthy bacteria

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.269 
thing it does not kill healthy bacteria
in<00:00:15.570> your<00:00:15.660> body<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.590> very<00:00:16.770> important

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
in your body this is very important

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.010 
in your body this is very important
because<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.060> particular<00:00:18.980> frequency<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
because it's a particular frequency and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.660 
because it's a particular frequency and
radiation<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.320> gives<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.740> well<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.250> will<00:00:23.400> not

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
radiation that gives up well it will not

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.269 
radiation that gives up well it will not
kill<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> way<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.590> made<00:00:25.710> it's

kill that is just the way it's made it's

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.339 
kill that is just the way it's made it's
a<00:00:26.340> very<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> highest<00:00:27.449> grade<00:00:27.660> silver<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
a very it's a highest grade silver I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.080 
a very it's a highest grade silver I
will<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.920> into<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> details<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:29.910> it's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
will go into all the details but it's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.139 
will go into all the details but it's
really<00:00:30.269> unique<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.439> highly<00:00:31.830> oxygenated<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
really unique it's highly oxygenated it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
really unique it's highly oxygenated it
will<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.510> kill<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.020> normal<00:00:34.290> bacteria<00:00:34.739> so

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
will not kill your normal bacteria so

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.459 
will not kill your normal bacteria so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.099 
drops three times a day about four hours
separation<00:00:59.090> then<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> work<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> fifteen

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
separation then you work up to fifteen

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.920 
separation then you work up to fifteen
may<00:01:01.260> take<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> weeks<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.940> does

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
may take it to weeks because it does

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
may take it to weeks because it does
detox<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.830> killing<00:01:05.159> off<00:01:05.280> parasites<00:01:05.850> it's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.820 
detox it's killing off parasites it's
doing<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.930> doing<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.409> you've<00:01:07.710> got

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
doing this it's doing that you've got

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890 
doing this it's doing that you've got

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
say six weeks probably is what we get at

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.690 
say six weeks probably is what we get at
42<00:01:43.409> days<00:01:43.820> so

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
42 days so

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.230 
42 days so
maybe<00:01:46.540> three<00:01:46.810> times<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:47.200> year<00:01:51.000> okay<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.330> then

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
maybe three times a year okay and then

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.420 
maybe three times a year okay and then
the<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:58.510> biophoton<00:01:59.110> machine<00:01:59.500> really<00:02:00.159> it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
the the biophoton machine really it's

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.130 
the the biophoton machine really it's
the<00:02:00.580> confident<00:02:01.000> okay<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.540> really<00:02:01.720> do<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.080> a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the confident okay you really do that a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.109 
the confident okay you really do that a
weekly<00:02:02.619> basis<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.100> make<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.550> remedy<00:02:03.940> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
major programming system you want to be

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.320 
major programming system you want to be
very<00:02:24.850> careful<00:02:25.120> about<00:02:25.360> watching<00:02:25.780> TV<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:29.280> that's

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
very careful about watching TV so that's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
very careful about watching TV so that's

meditation<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.880> did<00:02:34.090> probably<00:02:35.080> worth<00:02:35.440> doing

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
meditation we did probably worth doing

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.850 
meditation we did probably worth doing
at<00:02:36.070> least<00:02:36.310> once<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.670> day<00:02:37.380> probably<00:02:38.380> would<00:02:38.709> be

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
at least once a day probably would be

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.400 
at least once a day probably would be
nice<00:02:39.190> today<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.420> clear<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.810> frequencies

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
nice today and clear the frequencies

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.590 
nice today and clear the frequencies
remember<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.340> constant<00:02:43.090> thing<00:02:43.150> HAARP

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
remember it's a constant thing HAARP

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.380 
remember it's a constant thing HAARP
doesn't<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.850> happen<00:02:45.850> once<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.209> month

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
doesn't just like happen once a month

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.900 
doesn't just like happen once a month
you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.660> it's<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.680> going<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.220> all<00:02:48.459> that

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
you know it's it's going on all that

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.720 
you know it's it's going on all that
time<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.380> want<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.829> be<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.130> top<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:51.579> so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
time so you want to be on top of that so

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
time so you want to be on top of that so
I<00:02:51.790> think<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.239> covers<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.140> biggest<00:02:53.799> list

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I think that covers the biggest list

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.020 
I think that covers the biggest list
colloidal<00:02:55.079> divinely<00:02:56.079> colloidal<00:02:56.290> minerals

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
colloidal divinely colloidal minerals

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.670 
colloidal divinely colloidal minerals
are<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.570> maybe<00:03:01.780> one<00:03:02.049> or<00:03:02.140> two<00:03:02.170> ounces<00:03:02.620> a

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
are you know maybe one or two ounces a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.270 
are you know maybe one or two ounces a
day<00:03:02.799> it<00:03:03.790> will<00:03:04.000> mineralize<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:05.280> do

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
day it will mineralize you do

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.250 
day it will mineralize you do
significantly<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.840> really<00:03:07.989> good

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
significantly so that's a really good

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.650 
significantly so that's a really good
thing<00:03:08.470> too<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.459> that's<00:03:09.579> secondary<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
thing too but that's secondary to the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690 
thing too but that's secondary to the
fact<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:11.079> pulling<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.980> lot<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.579> these

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
fact it's pulling out a lot of these

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.069 
fact it's pulling out a lot of these

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
toxins and the spirit salts are stuff

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.350 
toxins and the spirit salts are stuff
you<00:03:20.230> take<00:03:20.709> on<00:03:20.890> an<00:03:21.010> ongoing<00:03:21.190> basis<00:03:21.820> just<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.150> few

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
you know have taken a position that all

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.870 
you know have taken a position that all
sounds<00:03:32.230> bad<00:03:33.269> that's<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.510> longer<00:03:34.959> discussion

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
sounds bad that's a longer discussion

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.289 
sounds bad that's a longer discussion
but<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:36.910> see<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.690> terms<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.110> frequency<00:03:38.350> and

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
but I see it in terms of frequency and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.440 
but I see it in terms of frequency and
salt<00:03:40.299> healthy<00:03:41.140> salt<00:03:41.609> biblical<00:03:42.609> salt<00:03:42.940> has<00:03:43.420> been

salt healthy salt biblical salt has been

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.620 
salt healthy salt biblical salt has been
used<00:03:43.959> for<00:03:44.320> literally<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.760> know<00:03:45.850> thousands<00:03:46.510> of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
used for literally you know thousands of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.280 
used for literally you know thousands of
years<00:03:47.100> even<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.190> Romans<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.970> know

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
years even the Romans you know

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.729 
years even the Romans you know
would<00:03:49.439> pay<00:03:49.739> people<00:03:50.060> insult<00:03:51.060> say<00:03:51.739> that's

would pay people insult say that's

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.319 
would pay people insult say that's
called<00:03:52.980> salary<00:03:53.519> salt<00:03:54.379> okay<00:03:55.379> so<00:03:56.060> we<00:03:57.060> really

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
called salary salt okay so we really

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.789 
called salary salt okay so we really
didn't<00:03:57.599> kind<00:03:57.719> of<00:03:57.840> make<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> distinction<00:03:58.500> there

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
didn't kind of make a distinction there

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.289 
didn't kind of make a distinction there
there<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> study<00:03:59.549> done<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.909> baleen<00:04:02.909> study

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
there was a study done the baleen study

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:11.300 
there was a study done the baleen study
they<00:04:03.750> keep<00:04:06.769> there's<00:04:09.049> 1984<00:04:10.049> that's<00:04:10.470> before

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
they keep there's 1984 that's before

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.849 
they keep there's 1984 that's before
that<00:04:12.000> they<00:04:12.209> studied<00:04:12.599> 10,000<00:04:13.200> people<00:04:13.379> and

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
that they studied 10,000 people and

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.009 
that they studied 10,000 people and
really<00:04:14.640> nobody<00:04:14.939> got<00:04:15.209> high<00:04:15.569> blood<00:04:15.810> pressure

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
really nobody got high blood pressure

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.490 
really nobody got high blood pressure
you<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:18.060> indigenous<00:04:18.900> people<00:04:19.289> did

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
you but but indigenous people did

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.529 
you but but indigenous people did
because<00:04:19.889> their<00:04:20.190> bodies<00:04:20.549> were<00:04:20.699> not<00:04:20.850> used<00:04:21.239> to

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
because their bodies were not used to

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.499 
because their bodies were not used to
the<00:04:22.019> table<00:04:22.349> salt<00:04:22.610> but<00:04:23.610> how<00:04:23.849> much<00:04:24.030> do<00:04:24.180> they<00:04:24.300> get

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
the table salt but how much do they get

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.800 
the table salt but how much do they get
well<00:04:24.720> one<00:04:25.020> point<00:04:25.789> one<00:04:26.789> point<00:04:26.820> two<00:04:27.270> seven<00:04:27.300> of

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
well one point one point two seven of

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.159 
well one point one point two seven of
systolic<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.280> half<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.639> point<00:04:29.849> in<00:04:30.720> dive<00:04:30.930> side

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
systolic and a half a point in dive side

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.820 
systolic and a half a point in dive side
which<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.470> really<00:04:31.770> nothing<00:04:32.090> so<00:04:33.090> but<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.930> have

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
which is really nothing so but I have

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.749 
which is really nothing so but I have
seen<00:04:35.039> people<00:04:35.280> have<00:04:35.400> their<00:04:35.550> blood<00:04:35.699> pressure

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
seen people have their blood pressure

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.659 
seen people have their blood pressure
raised<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.630> I'm<00:04:37.110> gonna<00:04:37.349> say<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.460> happen

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
raised so I'm gonna say it it can happen

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.680 
raised so I'm gonna say it it can happen
but<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.960> shouldn't<00:04:40.259> be<00:04:40.349> eating<00:04:40.440> regular<00:04:41.190> salt

the chemtrail salt which is under the
earth<00:05:04.380> not<00:05:04.770> only<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:05.130> get<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.340> vortex<00:05:05.880> energy

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
earth not only you get the vortex energy

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.510 
earth not only you get the vortex energy
but<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.900> are<00:05:06.960> getting<00:05:07.110> magnesium<00:05:07.949> which

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
but you are getting magnesium which

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.279 
but you are getting magnesium which
helps<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.090> protect<00:05:09.510> you<00:05:09.630> give<00:05:09.840> us<00:05:09.930> high<00:05:10.050> blood

helps to protect you give us high blood
pressure<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:11.280> other<00:05:11.400> thing<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.760> the

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
pressure the other thing is the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.570 
pressure the other thing is the
magnesium<00:05:12.510> is<00:05:12.630> needed<00:05:12.960> for<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.580> sodium

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
magnesium is needed for the sodium

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.430 
magnesium is needed for the sodium
potassium<00:05:14.820> pump<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.690> work<00:05:15.900> right<00:05:16.139> otherwise

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
potassium pump to work right otherwise

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.290 
potassium pump to work right otherwise
sodium<00:05:17.070> begins<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.520> gather<00:05:17.760> up<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.150> through

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
sodium begins to gather up and through

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.719 
sodium begins to gather up and through
the<00:05:18.449> cells<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.860> there's<00:05:20.159> something<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.610> get

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
the cells and there's something you get

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:21.800 
the cells and there's something you get
with<00:05:20.940> regular<00:05:21.090> table<00:05:21.539> salt

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
with regular table salt

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.409 
with regular table salt
so<00:05:21.930> there<00:05:22.080> all<00:05:22.169> kinds<00:05:22.409> of<00:05:22.620> subtleties<00:05:23.220> here

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
so there all kinds of subtleties here

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.230 
so there all kinds of subtleties here
why<00:05:25.099> there's<00:05:26.099> a<00:05:26.190> difference<00:05:26.610> but<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:26.940> biggest

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
why there's a difference but the biggest

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.870 
why there's a difference but the biggest
thing<00:05:27.389> is<00:05:27.599> it's<00:05:28.530> called<00:05:28.710> earth<00:05:28.979> frequencies

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
thing is it's called earth frequencies

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.520 
thing is it's called earth frequencies
we're<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.270> separated<00:05:31.020> from<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.229> earth<00:05:31.349> I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
we're so separated from the earth I

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.589 
we're so separated from the earth I
think<00:05:31.770> salt<00:05:32.400> was<00:05:32.580> probably<00:05:32.849> more<00:05:33.060> important

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
think salt was probably more important

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.189 
think salt was probably more important
now<00:05:33.659> than<00:05:33.690> ever<00:05:34.080> before<00:05:34.639> good<00:05:35.639> salt<00:05:35.940> no<00:05:36.780> earth

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
now than ever before good salt no earth

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.730 
now than ever before good salt no earth
salt<00:05:38.449> because<00:05:39.449> we're<00:05:39.630> so<00:05:39.900> disconnected<00:05:40.169> from

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
salt because we're so disconnected from

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.370 
salt because we're so disconnected from
the<00:05:40.919> earth<00:05:41.099> that<00:05:41.820> we<00:05:42.000> need<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.840> have<00:05:43.139> those

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
the earth that we need to have those

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.710 
the earth that we need to have those
earth<00:05:43.710> frequencies<00:05:44.370> radiating<00:05:45.210> us

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
earth frequencies radiating us

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.460 
earth frequencies radiating us
throughout<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.380> day<00:05:47.539> eroding<00:05:48.539> us<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:48.930> and

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
throughout the day eroding us so and

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.399 
throughout the day eroding us so and
that<00:05:49.710> is<00:05:49.919> it's<00:05:50.820> kind<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.210> virtual<00:05:51.630> if<00:05:52.139> you<00:05:52.259> just

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
that is it's kind of virtual if you just

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:53.749 
that is it's kind of virtual if you just
talk<00:05:52.620> about<00:05:52.800> salt<00:05:53.099> but<00:05:53.220> if<00:05:53.280> you<00:05:53.370> understand

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
talk about salt but if you understand

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.220 
talk about salt but if you understand
its<00:05:53.970> frequencies

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
its frequencies

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.340 
its frequencies
and<00:05:55.320> vortexes<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.630> know<00:05:57.750> and

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
and vortexes you you know and

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.080 
and vortexes you you know and
reconnecting<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.160> mother<00:05:59.370> earth<00:05:59.550> it's<00:05:59.880> good

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
reconnecting the mother earth it's good

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.640 
reconnecting the mother earth it's good
I<00:06:00.120> would<00:06:00.390> say<00:06:00.570> that<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.870> people<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.290> say<00:06:01.470> no

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
I would say that the people to say no

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.940 
I would say that the people to say no
assault<00:06:02.060> may<00:06:03.060> have<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.480> look<00:06:03.660> at<00:06:03.900> their<00:06:04.530> level

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
assault may have to look at their level

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.130 
assault may have to look at their level
of<00:06:04.980> disconnection<00:06:05.640> from<00:06:05.670> the<00:06:05.880> earth<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.420> think

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
of disconnection from the earth I think

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.220 
of disconnection from the earth I think
that<00:06:07.470> this<00:06:07.650> is<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.920> level<00:06:08.160> of<00:06:08.730> routine<00:06:09.150> we<00:06:09.960> use

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
that this is the level of routine we use

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.620 
that this is the level of routine we use
the<00:06:10.680> salt<00:06:11.190> all<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.520> time<00:06:11.730> and<00:06:12.030> it's<00:06:12.480> great

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
the salt all the time and it's great

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.150 
the salt all the time and it's great
then<00:06:12.930> we<00:06:13.050> have<00:06:13.170> never<00:06:13.380> I<00:06:13.710> don't<00:06:13.830> think<00:06:13.950> we've

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
then we have never I don't think we've

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.660 
then we have never I don't think we've
ever<00:06:14.400> seen<00:06:15.440> but<00:06:16.440> it's<00:06:16.620> possible<00:06:17.190> I<00:06:17.310> take<00:06:17.520> that

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
ever seen but it's possible I take that

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.960 
ever seen but it's possible I take that
back<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.600> was<00:06:18.720> one<00:06:18.900> person<00:06:19.140> I<00:06:19.410> think<00:06:19.970> who's

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
back it was one person I think who's

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.970 
back it was one person I think who's
extremely<00:06:21.330> sensitive<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:22.050> all<00:06:22.290> salt<00:06:22.680> but<00:06:22.860> I

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
extremely sensitive to all salt but I

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.530 
extremely sensitive to all salt but I
don't<00:06:23.370> know<00:06:23.490> what<00:06:23.730> what<00:06:23.970> that<00:06:24.150> was<00:06:24.330> but

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
don't know what what that was but

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.870 
don't know what what that was but
otherwise<00:06:24.870> we'd<00:06:25.710> never<00:06:25.890> see<00:06:26.160> a<00:06:26.190> vegan<00:06:26.550> you

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
otherwise we'd never see a vegan you

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.310 
otherwise we'd never see a vegan you
know<00:06:27.030> high<00:06:27.210> blood<00:06:27.420> pressure<00:06:27.660> and<00:06:27.840> this<00:06:27.960> person

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
know high blood pressure and this person

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.600 
know high blood pressure and this person
didn't<00:06:28.560> get<00:06:28.680> high<00:06:28.800> blood<00:06:29.010> pressure<00:06:29.220> they<00:06:29.430> got

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
didn't get high blood pressure they got

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.330 
didn't get high blood pressure they got
no<00:06:29.820> slowing<00:06:30.360> so<00:06:31.170> they<00:06:31.290> had<00:06:31.500> medical<00:06:32.280> problems

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
no slowing so they had medical problems

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.900 
no slowing so they had medical problems
but<00:06:33.830> without<00:06:34.830> any<00:06:35.130> medical<00:06:35.460> problems
