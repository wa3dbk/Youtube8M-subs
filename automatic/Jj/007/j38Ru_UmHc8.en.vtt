00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.780
 very good friends and friends welcome to 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.920
 point 5 x 1 and I bring you the analysis of 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.950
 this great product 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.780
 this is the lens or what clip the 4 in one 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.340
 who just pulled out the holo brand clip 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.519
 you can find anyway the 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.499
 link in the description this brand has 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.689
 released this lens with which we are going to 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.480
 be able to take great pictures and 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.779
 great videos on our phone in 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.939
 our iphone ipod touch and the models 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.649
 they vary depending on the lens there 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.749
 several models this is concretely the 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.000
 of the iphone 5 and iphone 5 is the ipod touch 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.829
 of fifth generation you also have a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.670
 model with the same characteristics 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.070
 but for the previous devices 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.559
 this mark or the clip has sent us to 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.120
 five by one this lens so that the 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.039
 we could so that we could 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.710
 show all of you we have 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.089
 got an unpacked 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.190
 to put a voice on that unpacked 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.530
 explaining certain things that are 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.539
 remarkable inside the box and then in 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.789
 the final part I have done what you 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.649
 many will be interested to see the results 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.690
 that really give these lenses 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.060
 agreement 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.400
 in its four modes in the macro by ten 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 in the macro for fifteen and then also 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 in the angle of the eye of a girl and then in a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.259
 angle that makes you distance more in 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 a big angle but calling it is a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.070
 angle at which you distance yourself more than 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
 lehman finally you are going to see the results 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.649
 I'm going to put the same shots with each 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 lens is to say for example the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.990
 macro photographs not because the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.280
 macro photographs it is clear that the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.140
 iphone sale does not arrive until that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
 point but in the pictures of the game 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 of pc and wide angle yes you are going to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 notice the final difference guys 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.940
 I hope you like the video is going to be a 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.770
 short video but I think what 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.990
 sufficiently interactive so that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.780
 this Christmas you ask the kings 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.470
 these lenses in short we go with the mind 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.470
 we tell you guys 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 well here we have guys the box 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.200
 four in one containing the single clip 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.580
 four objectives as we are seeing in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.070
 the bottom of the box where we 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.190
 puts macro by 15 macro by 10 wide 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.810
 angle and fish age also we also 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.850
 indicates the models for which it is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.459
 compatible iphone 5 iphone 5 s ipod 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.020
 fifth generation touch here in this 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.150
 part of the box also specifies us 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.730
 more specifically the possibilities that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.440
 it offers us and internally 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 when we deploy the back of 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.010
 the box we can see some examples with 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.319
 the results that we could obtain with 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.900
 each lens also gives us a 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.360
 description of what each part contains 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.910
 of the good lens said this we proceed 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.950
 to unpack the single clip and we're going to 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.269
 check the first things and the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.470
 first conclusions here we are 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.690
 seeing that there is nothing inside the box 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.150
 more as you see and nothing here in the package 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.410
 for good once we open the box we 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.940
 let's find that in the part 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.590
 bottom we have the bag that contains 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.700
 some caps with which we can cover 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.799
 the people when we are not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.500
 using and then on the top 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.470
 Well, we're looking at the holo lens 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.540
 clip but good let's show them from 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.700
 a little more closely, come on, let's go there 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.379
 well here we are seeing that the lens 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.670
 contains two parts one the left the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.680
 right the part on the left 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.040
 contains the white angle and to the right 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.019
 contains the fish ice the fish eye 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.760
 we are going to be a threaded because 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.260
 these lenses move unscrew what 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.720
 let's check if we are going to 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.780
 unscrew a part of the lens there 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.000
 we could see the macro by 10 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.110
 as you are seeing is that lens we 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.180
 we will simply have to lower the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.670
 iphone with that of threaded and by the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.470
 On the other hand, the macro by 15 works like this 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.840
 of simple is that you can take the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.640
 four lenses in a tiny little bag 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.950
 that contains nothing a very little gadget 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
 little one and nothing for you to see that it 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.760
 puts in a totally simple way not 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.530
 there's nothing more to fit is the most 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.110
 simple that there are we take our iphone and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.480
 iphone 5 in this case and nothing we do that 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.950
 lace up a little click and nothing 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.260
 once we check that everything is fine 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.630
 already fit we can start to take the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.430
 first conclusions right now I'm going 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.900
 to show the lens that I have on 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.480
 Right now I have the fish eye 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.010
 ok and let's check so you can see 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.690
 the difference because there is a great 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.550
 difference and you are going to check it now 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.160
 same right now I have put there a 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.810
 support so you can see how the 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.360
 photo with fisheye you can see I think 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.280
 quite and now I'm just going to remove the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.900
 lens so that yourselves six 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.459
 witnesses of the big difference there 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.299
 between the holo fish eye clip and the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.759
 normal iphone 5 camera 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.889
 there you have seen it is coming 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.940
 brutally to the objective in nothing of 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.199
 distance 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.819
 now let's try with the white angle 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.099
 come on let's go there but let's put in 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.810
 our iphone you already know a way 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.819
 totally simple and I show you more 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.409
 in detail from another position does 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.000
 click everything fits perfectly and there 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.560
 we are seeing we have gotten into pro 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.490
 camera because it works with several 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.500
 applications with all applications 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.090
 of photography we take the photo and there 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.460
 we see that there is a great distance between 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.590
 the objective that I am photographing with 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.099
 that lens now I take it off and you'll see 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.620
 as suddenly it sticks you have seen it 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.060
 note a lot the good difference these are 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.469
 the covers that I told you guys 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.300
 with these caps we can 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.680
 make our lenses protect 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.240
 when we are using it is also 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.590
 It is highly recommended to use them so that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.330
 is scratched because you know you can 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.699
 imagine that the sunglasses or clips 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.740
 they are an object and they are pretty glasses 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.960
 sensitive and when they have dirt or 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.030
 they are scratched because they really can not 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.940
 get the best results 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.320
 good and of course do not forget 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.180
 when we leave the house with these lenses 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.430
 take it in the bag that is super 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.160
 comfortable let's see video results 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.660
 guys hello guys that is the monkey this 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.360
 video I'm recording it right now with 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.030
 the polo clip and with his fish eye on 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.950
 now just from the same position I'm going 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.930
 to remove it and you are going to see the difference 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.590
 you will see how suddenly my head seems 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.590
 much larger 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.340
 it's worth just guys I just removed the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.319
 audio clip I have not even felt 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.560
 this video I liked removed the halo club 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.020
 and here you are seeing the difference 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.310
 these guys is a video test at 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.080
 just like you before with the fish eye 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.690
 but now with the goal of great 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.419
 angle of the lens or what clip and just 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.000
 right now I'm going to remove it and you'll see 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.220
 as now it collects much less space the 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.820
 iphone camera itself by default 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.820
 Let's go there 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:18.080
 and here you are seeing the result I do not know 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.080
 how is it being checked by watching me 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.920
 Well, guys, up to here, this one 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.110

 he has loved and gives him a lot but 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.310
 that much useful as you are already seeing 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.050
 here I am recording with the fish eye of 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.430
 holo that so nothing to figure out and which 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.830
 is the angle that I like the most and it will be that 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.030
 onwards for the videos in order
