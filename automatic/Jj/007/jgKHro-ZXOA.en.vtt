00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.699
 our campaign was a campaign of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.670
 launch of the Greek light and is a product 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.310
 very interesting because it is him 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 really has the texture and flavor of a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.529
 normal Greek language to the designers who 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.529
 Do you think the nestlé is hotter? 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 So this campaign was for us to do. 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.899
 a product launch did not exist 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 is still this Greek light category in the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.340
 market the campaign if it has 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 commercial Greek goddess right that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.719
 woman she comes in the fridge and just picks up 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.410
 the Greek haiti and it is received by a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.160
 legion of greek mini Greek men from the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160
 ancient Greece 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.340
 the biggest challenge that we have received is 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.490
 when we started working this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.119
 product was to launch a category in the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.409
 a goal not only to create 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.530
 product differentials but also 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.659
 to try within the possible to become synonymous 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.229
 category this segment is a segment 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.909
 where you do not see much creativity 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.149
 sees a lot of innovation does not see many 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.790
 differential and adp a nestlé allows 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.229
 demands this from us to people and to 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.420
 our creative team 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.270
 The wonder I think we 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.860
 this objective 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.860
 this challenge that the client has 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.660
 see the movie was released digitally 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.820
 how and with tv 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.190
 and there is a format that the media invented 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.990
 and catar it highlighting along with 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.759
 placed a and b with the portals which is a 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.310
 new metric to measure the video whose 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.500
 rpi trp just like on tv 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.100
 then it has been massively publicized 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.360
 more than 4 million views and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.130
 consequence of it came the application in 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.019
 facebook that is where everyone could 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.019
 experience to the concept 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.100
 we must take great care 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.890
 with the with the montage is a film that the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.480
 people were filming a group of Greeks 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.750
 inside a refrigerator 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.460
 so how to do this the first occurred 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.400
 a study is not 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.630
 was filmed refrigerator a defined angle 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.430
 and then possibly filmed the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.940
 Scream is a group of Greeks 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.110
 in the same year of the refrigerator and there is born more 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.500
 from above 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.980
 I think the care is in assembling this 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.510
 do not fit after the Greeks 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.900
 filmed from above inside the refrigerator 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.900
 with the same vision of the girl who opens the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.120
 refrigerator and the result was incredible with 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.000
 super cool on the set itself people already 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.630
 made a quick assembly that he already noticed 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.630
 that worked 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.480
 This movie is a very 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.060
 interesting because it got light stayed 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.790
 funny but he meets each of the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.340
 points of the group that we wanted to talk about 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.280
 the Greek goddess expression that comes from 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.970
 Greek gods beauty that comes from giving 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.450
 beauty of welfare already exists and the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.530
 people just meet today is 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.319
 of this concept that I think is very 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.900
 Happy to show you that by eating Greek 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.139

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.139
 goddess 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.600
 We did not understand the Greek minister. 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.140
 Haiti 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.850
 goddess no less less fats and 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.519
 less colorful so I call everyone 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.830
 the days every day comes after watching 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:27.170
 costly is very yummy and very creamy 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:29.330
 delicious open yogurt group line 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.550
 Brazil was the most complete came 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.230
 nestle Greek light for you to feel 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.230
