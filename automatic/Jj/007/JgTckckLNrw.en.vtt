00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.980
 video guide for the customers that is the 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.269
 sixth boss the throne of the summer and 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.769
 is a pretty bad-tempered bird 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.839
 felt just is just now just before 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.179
 if I mean that he is simple 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.800
 is a boss of you in any case 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.660
 requires that you have good content 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.929
 can watch as he often diverse 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.789
 deadly construction skills pay attention to the 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.470
 fight is very important part expensive 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.769
 damage distributor entertainer in groups 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.350
 you need two groups of three each 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.030
 damage dispenser and a healer the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.490
 later on the nests of diakon 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.970
 They react to those down here and there 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.530
 above 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.300
 He will be in the course of the fight 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.580
 activate as many small hearts come 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.380
 out you have to break if 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.850
 you play with three others is for the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.590
 the beginning is to be recommended is you have to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.940
 select a damage dispenser 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.430
 which occurs in both teams so the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.290
 Almost always with in the nests is that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.570
 should actually have a better chance 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.300
 all because it is very important 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.350
 the birds of the enzborn very very fast 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.720
 be broken 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.610
 let's start with the easy part of 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.110
 fight on and that's me on top 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 the platform happens where the crew is 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.750
 sitting around you need two 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.550
 tanks for the fight the gf2 divers 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.580
 be careful that is the one 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.800
 infected claw which ensures that 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.020
 The grandchildren will be found three 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.810
 20,000 natural damage suffers 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.550
 that's not very much in itself 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 but the effect is stackable 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.130
 that means he comes pretty fast 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.200
 pretty high and there with one 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.210
 extremely nasty is not the reason 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.620
 why we have to wait much more important 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.140
 is that claws tear 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.720
 that's an extremely strong one 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.360
 melee attack the 175 country became it 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.820
 always very critical designation at the end 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.560
 of the day come after nearly 350,000 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.720
 damage rhine at the average 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.400
 Tanks is not in itself 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.020
 problematic you can dress well 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.520
 The problem is obtained for a minute 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.470
 you then after the eponymous beagle 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.360
 claws tear that makes sure that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.430
 next claws travel 50 percent more 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.979
 Doing harm then does that extremely 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.470
 that's why you'll trade in it 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.610
 as soon as they had this dear 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.130
 the other one thinks in time 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.260
 but not unemployed 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.910
 the other one is worried about that 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.460
 These green puddles are blowing everywhere 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 be sucked nanny in these greens 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.360
 sit in it stays standing now 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.250
 was 100,000 damage points per second 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.080
 after three seconds they disappear 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.460
 puddle then, however, on the main fight 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.930
 There are still a few surfaces 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.930
 to pay more attention to things that are for 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.330
 one of the spring quills thereby leaves the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.340
 Customers hope his feather everywhere 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.260
 whizzing around the platform and doing it 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.090
 a massive damage to an entire group 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.950
 So over 80 customers every second 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.800
 88,000 physical damage 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 that hurts so much you should 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.190
 raid kulant or not necessarily own 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.530
 to draw your temper or health stones 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.490
 he does not do that very often though 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.330
 when it comes you should 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.160
 to be prepared 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.570
 especially because you are always just a healer 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.770
 on the platform will have in the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.800
 most cases because more and of course a 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.720
 another important skill is the downdraft 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 that could actually be from lake city 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.790
 You are about to become one of them 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.700
 platform is pressed under a 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.380
 a bit stupid because different than the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.650
 ski will be pushed out the sales strength 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.750
 the more you stand outside even if he is 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.950
 directly to the customer you will be in 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.600
 hardly notice downwind you can continue 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.610
 hit it if you are a bit further away 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.650
 wait wait the fernkÃ¤mpfer are then 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.090
 would be really nasty down protected if 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.410
 but these are relative 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.570
 quickly pushed up again 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.030
 That's not very nice anyway 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.790
 because you will need to hurt 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.040
 and thereby lose a lot of time 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.090
 also looks in school that is in 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.770
 essentially what's on the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.420
 main platform happens to you 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.300
 he should pay attention he sees something 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.700
 stands apart because the customers to 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.110
 to damage a croaking fall 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.540
 it makes some players pretty 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.850
 Unfortunately, it was inevitable and bad for 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.200
 otherwise if you're going through it almost in one 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.150
 be single and if they are not 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.459
 then they are destroyed as well 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.720
 with sound attacking all later 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.580
 meet who stand around me when 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.800
 her aim is to avoid that 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.390
 is that apart 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.940
 well what happens now but actually 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.280
 with those stupid nests around 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.790
 The coal are distributed in four testers 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.320
 who regularly hatch chicks 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.610
 recognizes that by the big red rays 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.950
 the coolest ones are in it 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.090
 if these chicks hatch you have to 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.299
 hop down there 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.220
 destroy these chicks very quickly 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.669
 the media otherwise relatively fast 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.919
 and fly up again immediately 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.470
 First of all, he simply demanded it 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.460
 but of you a few pretty 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.409
 complicated keys makes you have to 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.300
 entertained here 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.979
 depending on which leaves starts here 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 The first thing that comes out, you see 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.440
 that right from the point where you arrive 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.199
 if you help country on the platform 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.270
 or not hop or maybe one 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.740
 run a little faster 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.539
 It always depends on where it jumps off 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.889
 and where not it is a matter of experience 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.530
 where you pretty much try around 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.300
 Need to become 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.400
 the little info at the first leaves 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.930
 that comes out will not bounce her 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.639
 you have to go right there 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.650
 run down and then learn on the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.120
 platform on the second test is worth it 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.550
 to hop this 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.870
 that you land properly you become 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.550
 beginning a few times over the catch 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.050
 is quite normal , do not worry 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.000
 Much more important is when you are on the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.430
 net lands brings the fastest possible 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.530
 chick and then collect the feathers 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.389
 you see there when you make his mistakes 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.770
 his gets her an extra action button 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.539
 if you have a little mistake and if 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.680
 you are not activated you can fly 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.000
 there are always 14 below that means no 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.370
 stay aware and with whom you can 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.139
 what is important in a yard now 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.580
 is somehow to come up and to 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.469
 others can fly very high with it 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.969
 that's important when getting involved over 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.789
 the art offered there is there too 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.860
 still with some other networks of 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.840
 fight process then looks like that you 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.060
 always alternating team 1 team two 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.889
 down or just yard depending on the 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.039
 which is activated first and immediately 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.509
 the chick up there so that knocks down the because 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.770
 which are fed that 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.169
 happens whenever a chick 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.690
 the customers are completely hatched 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.949
 nasty zeug out purely on the one hand 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.360
 brown shape on the nests 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.919
 The chicks have to eat down 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.340
 whereupon they mutate that they are not 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.690
 want and the other will be the big one 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.440
 green short directly above 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.199
 dress up 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.120
 that is pretty disgusting but you have to 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.460
 if you happen to be flying with 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.349
 your additional experts fly into it 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.810
 That's how you get hold of it 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.889
 pause of the cure and your hurt he 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.590
 you will get a bit too 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.909
 harm that is negligible 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.190
 important is also if you are such a green 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.779
 cap effort then comes the green 14th 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.889
 I have to be on the ground and that must occur 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.810
 sit less drink 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.180
 Remember, we also have actions 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.649
 the upper bar must be the upper one 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.419
 of course you fly high, too 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:41.880
 if it looks extremely high you need 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.070
 no wings to land with it again 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.810
 you can just hop under 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.969
 blasphemous and then with that 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.680
 But landing is similarly complicated 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.419
 askri hop down on the bottom 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.610
 Wet you just have to look that we 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.210
 it really lands on this big one 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.409
 projection as we see it 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.120
 that's essentially the whole 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.469
 fight he is a bit complicated he 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.389
 will need a lot of exercise and you need 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.009
 especially a player with a lot of good 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.680
 Survey is best one all the time 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.539
 Drugs is looking in all directions 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.000
 and always says which team is just off 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.289
 is an equal leaves just then 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.089
 if he has that then it is too 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.649
 half rent 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:17.539
 and otherwise the fight is pure 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:19.620
 exercise thing 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:21.680
 We wish you a lot of fun and 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.680
 success
