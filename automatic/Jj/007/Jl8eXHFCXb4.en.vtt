00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.200
 good is important is a match 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.129
 Cup we are giving the importance 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.930
 it deserves 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.309
 for us that out there now not 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.560
 we are adding minutes in the tournament 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.570
 local is important to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.760
 prove to the teacher that we are in 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.619
 a good level and that before any 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.320
 circumstance we can count on 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.789
 us so good we face 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.100
 a team that comes well in its category 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.340
 so it's a very difficult challenge 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.850
 because the team is playing very well 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.659
 then good today some of us 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.309
 is playing wait a bit to be able to 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.440
 be in court but but good too 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.319
 It's nice that the team is in this 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.289
 moment and one has to support the place 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:54.409
 that it's up to him so that when he does not 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.829
 need to be able to enter the team and a 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.560
 team that is very good and that is 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.360
 important that 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.720
 and what one has to try not to 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.540
 you notice the absence of anyone and that the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.940
 teacher be calm and confident that 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.560
 every player who has to be in the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.930
 campus can do well the key 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.640
 I always believe that at work 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 and I think it was very important that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.320
 the coaching staff and ourselves 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.299
 the players in difficult times 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.590
 We kept calm and we continue trusting 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.250
 in what we were doing then 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.899
 the results and the team arrived 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.560
 he began to take confidence and a flight 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.299
 very good football then good 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.579
 I think the important thing was to have 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.780
 kept calm and keep working and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.939
 trusting what we were doing 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.479
 it's not being used on the computer but 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.000
 if the teacher uses players where 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.280
 gives a lot of freedom case of the Chinese or case 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 of 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.180
 from mathias vidangossy then I think that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.770
 in those positions I think I would not have 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.680
 problem in occupying those in the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.180
 team and conform to what the team 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.509
 is doing that is pressing a lot 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.720
 up and those that give us freedom to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.130
 play I think I would have no problems in 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.190
 be able to use that variant maybe I 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.800
 could provide something else verticality the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.360
 Chinese brings you more more game more 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.340
 distribute the game more balance in the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.769
 midfield we are players of different 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.209
 features but good always 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.710
 seeing the rivals one can point to 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.300
 a 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:39.050
 one player to another as the same for some 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.540
 of the bands with freedom 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.700
 is a player that I need out there what 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.620
 What does the teacher give me? I do not know what it is. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.640
 little freedom in three quarters towards 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.060
 front so 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.190
 no it's no problem in maybe not 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.920
 be a marked hitch and if playing in 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.920
 attack by some other position does not vary
