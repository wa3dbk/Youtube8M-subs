00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
I guess I've been avoiding loads of

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.150 
I guess I've been avoiding loads of
small<00:00:08.250> models<00:00:08.700> which<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.210> can<00:00:09.420> see<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.660> here

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
small models which you can see in here

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.260 
small models which you can see in here
like<00:00:11.660> sake<00:00:12.660> roses<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:16.940> spiraled<00:00:17.940> snail

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
like sake roses and spiraled snail

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:29.769 
like sake roses and spiraled snail
shells<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:20.990> well<00:00:21.990> somebody's<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.880> I<00:00:26.930> think<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
shells and well somebody's and I think I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.479 
shells and well somebody's and I think I
got<00:00:31.099> one<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:33.290> frames<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.890> thought<00:00:35.280> they

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
got one or two frames but I thought they

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
got one or two frames but I thought they
didn't<00:00:35.760> look<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.090> nice<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.590> didn't<00:00:37.950> do

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
didn't look that nice so I didn't do

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.369 
didn't look that nice so I didn't do
very<00:00:38.070> many<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.760> those<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
very many of those I think just to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.700 
very many of those I think just to
actually<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> most<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.899> roses<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
actually so most of these are roses and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.450 
actually so most of these are roses and
lilies<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.730> aspired<00:00:45.690> safe<00:00:46.050> shells<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.649> I've

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
lilies and aspired safe shells and I've

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
lilies and aspired safe shells and I've
been<00:00:47.730> deemed<00:00:47.910> during<00:00:48.360> these<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.110> couple

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.060 
cover sake rose and they're quite
pleased<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.630> reason<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.440> think<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.040> looks

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
pleased for that reason I think it looks

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.510 
pleased for that reason I think it looks
very<00:02:38.490> nice<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:40.350> third<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> did<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
very nice and the third one I did is

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.110 
very nice and the third one I did is
well<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.780> basically<00:02:43.170> folded<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.010> small

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.570 

Stegosaurus<00:02:48.120> by<00:02:48.300> montrol<00:02:48.810> today<00:02:49.590> because<00:02:50.310> I

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
Stegosaurus by montrol today because I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.580 
Stegosaurus by montrol today because I
want<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.000> show<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.240> how<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.600> fold<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.170> maybe

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
want to show you how to fold it maybe

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.670 
want to show you how to fold it maybe
next<00:02:52.890> weekend<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:54.570> did<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> big<00:02:55.170> version<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
next weekend and I did a big version of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.910 
next weekend and I did a big version of
that<00:02:55.709> too<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:57.300> hey<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.230> I've<00:02:58.680> got<00:02:58.890> to

that too and hey here it is I've got to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.890 
that too and hey here it is I've got to
go<00:02:59.100> away<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.459> bit<00:02:59.730> for<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:02.630> can<00:03:03.630> see

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
go away a bit for you to see it can see

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.520 
go away a bit for you to see it can see
all<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.440> pointy<00:03:05.040> bits<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.050> see<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
all the pointy bits and you can see the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.630 
all the pointy bits and you can see the
head<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> mouth<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.230> tail

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
head with the mouth can see the tail

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.080 
head with the mouth can see the tail
yeah<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.380> like<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.709> one<00:03:13.769> too<00:03:14.090> and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090

yeah and I really like that one too and
I<00:03:15.239> think<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.989> know<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.410> couple<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.040> guys<00:03:17.250> might

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
I think you know a couple of guys might

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.370 
I think you know a couple of guys might
think<00:03:17.550> new<00:03:18.030> that's<00:03:18.300> really<00:03:18.630> cool<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.260> know

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
think new that's really cool you know

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.400 
think new that's really cool you know
it's<00:03:19.560> not<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:20.010> about<00:03:20.130> flowers<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.410> stupid

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
it's not just about flowers and stupid

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.660 
it's not just about flowers and stupid
shells<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.450> um<00:03:24.450> well<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.769> has<00:03:25.980> been<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.430> day

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
shells and um well this has been a day

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.820 
shells and um well this has been a day
full<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.120> origami<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.959> haven't<00:03:28.350> been<00:03:28.440> floating

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
full of origami I haven't been floating

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.380 
full of origami I haven't been floating
for<00:03:29.010> quite<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> while<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.820> if<00:03:30.239> you're

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
for quite a while and if you're

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.110 
for quite a while and if you're
wondering<00:03:30.800> i<00:03:31.800> actually<00:03:32.430> started<00:03:32.760> doing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
wondering i actually started doing

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.430 
wondering i actually started doing
origami<00:03:34.010> when<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:36.050> basically<00:03:37.050> in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
origami when was that basically in

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.070 
origami when was that basically in
january<00:03:38.450> 2006<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.170> that's<00:03:41.630> almost<00:03:42.630> one<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
january 2006 so that's almost one and a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.520 
january 2006 so that's almost one and a
half

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
half

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.340 
half
now<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:44.520> I<00:03:44.850> hadn't<00:03:45.390> including<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.959> long<00:03:46.170> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
now so I hadn't including that long and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.949 
now so I hadn't including that long and
actually<00:03:46.860> about<00:03:47.760> nine<00:03:48.060> months<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.630> I

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
actually about nine months of that I

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.380 
actually about nine months of that I
wasn't<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:49.860> feeling<00:03:50.310> either<00:03:50.430> because<00:03:51.060> I

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
wasn't really feeling either because I

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.240 
wasn't really feeling either because I
didn't<00:03:52.020> have<00:03:52.140> time<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.620> didn't<00:03:52.860> feel<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.069> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
didn't have time I didn't feel like it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.420 
didn't have time I didn't feel like it
you<00:03:54.120> know<00:03:54.240> stuff<00:03:54.480> like<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:55.430> you

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
you know stuff like that just you

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.410 
you know stuff like that just you
randomly<00:03:56.910> do<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.390> it's<00:03:57.540> tough<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.160> but<00:03:59.160> now

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
randomly do that it's tough and but now

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.510 
randomly do that it's tough and but now
I've<00:04:00.420> kind<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.080> committed<00:04:01.410> myself<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:02.069> bit<00:04:02.280> more

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
I've kind of committed myself a bit more

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.150 
I've kind of committed myself a bit more
to<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.850> Oxford<00:04:03.480> University<00:04:04.200> origami<00:04:04.590> society

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
to the Oxford University origami society

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.650 
to the Oxford University origami society
again<00:04:05.370> I've<00:04:05.580> been<00:04:05.730> teaching<00:04:05.880> small<00:04:06.330> models

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
again I've been teaching small models

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.430 
again I've been teaching small models
and<00:04:07.580> then<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.610> have<00:04:08.819> this<00:04:08.970> idea<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.720> Pinot<00:04:10.110> doing

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
and then I have this idea of Pinot doing

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.290 
and then I have this idea of Pinot doing
some<00:04:10.709> videos<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:11.069> youtube<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.660> saw<00:04:13.200> quite<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> few

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
some videos on youtube I saw quite a few

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.690 
some videos on youtube I saw quite a few
capacity<00:04:15.300> rose<00:04:15.690> videos<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.709> actually<00:04:17.280> after

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
capacity rose videos and actually after

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.360 
capacity rose videos and actually after
I<00:04:17.790> searched<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:19.230> after<00:04:19.590> I've<00:04:19.739> uploaded<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
I searched and after I've uploaded the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.220 
I searched and after I've uploaded the
video<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.970> thought<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.329> know<00:04:21.390> let's<00:04:22.019> see

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
video and I thought you know let's see

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.500 
video and I thought you know let's see
what's<00:04:22.800> out<00:04:22.980> there<00:04:23.160> anyways<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:24.330> there

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
what's out there anyways but there

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.240 
what's out there anyways but there
aren't<00:04:24.630> very<00:04:24.780> many<00:04:24.990> complex<00:04:25.560> models<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.100> there

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
aren't very many complex models on there

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.250 
aren't very many complex models on there
obviously<00:04:26.460> because<00:04:27.210> they<00:04:27.840> need<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.080> lot<00:04:28.200> of

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
obviously because they need a lot of

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.360 
obviously because they need a lot of
time<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.680> fold<00:04:28.970> but<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.330> think<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.710> might<00:04:31.919> try<00:04:32.280> to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
time to fold but I think we might try to

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.030 
time to fold but I think we might try to
tell<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.970> anyways<00:04:33.419> so<00:04:34.200> yeah<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.229> want

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
tell that anyways so yeah so if you want

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.820 
tell that anyways so yeah so if you want
to<00:04:38.220> learn<00:04:38.669> how<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.180> do<00:04:39.510> this<00:04:41.450> model<00:04:42.450> I'm<00:04:43.350> going

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
to learn how to do this model I'm going

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.300 
to learn how to do this model I'm going
to<00:04:43.979> try<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.340> make<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.940> video<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.070> if<00:04:47.070> it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
to try to make a video of it and if it

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.159 
to try to make a video of it and if it
doesn't<00:04:47.880> turn<00:04:48.060> out<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.450> be<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:48.900> totally

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
doesn't turn out to be like totally

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.420 
doesn't turn out to be like totally
crappy<00:04:49.890> then<00:04:50.900> yeah<00:04:51.900> maybe<00:04:52.110> next<00:04:52.500> week<00:04:52.800> good

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430
