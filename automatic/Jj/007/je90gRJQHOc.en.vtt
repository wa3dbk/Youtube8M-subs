00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.460
 I have something 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.080
 why and here i'm some of my own 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.840
 he speeches them there or posters there 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.670
 I refer to the president Nabuh Poroshenko and 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.020
 so on though by the way on the unit poroshenko 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.869
 nowhere do you have to pay attention 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.230
 but I have a very simple version 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.980
 there was a revolution it did not end 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.850
 no victory Maidan did not hold anything 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.930
 not changed what has changed in reality 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.820
 Only one last name has changed 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.230
 that is, he became president instead 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.140
 Yanukovych Poroshenko 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.920
 I give this analogy we play 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 checkers game and one single checker 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.690
 we managed to spend in kings 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.699
 this is not a profitable party this is just 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 One piece and she can not even play 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.340
 if we want this bet to play 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:14.020
 we need enough people 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.860
 drag there in order that well they 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 I could change something together 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.040
 did not go away at all 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.890
 my one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.180
 slogan there you will not see this last name 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.290
 the point is to have the president have it 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.030
 position they last name you need to understand that 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.450
 the president is not the last name 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:43.090
 so I think that now in this 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.250
 moment we have to hope that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.619
 Poroshenko really wants to change 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.600
 this country for the better why should we 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.770
 it hopes because hope more 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 nothing much clear logic means we 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.189
 should give a chance for this to happen for 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.509
 we have to go there with him 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.420
 try to root out those 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.359
 freaks who sat down there but call 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.160
 things with their names and change this whole 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.560
 design change it not only on 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.560
 surname level but also at the text level 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.380
 well after some time maybe 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.970
 President will choose another this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.590
 quite normal process in this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.050
 there is nothing like that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.360
 no personality cult towards 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.630
 President Poroshenko but at the moment 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:39.250
 time he is there and well another 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.260
 man there on whom normal people 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.920
 in this country could rely i don't 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.530
 I see well with a sufficient amount of authority 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.650
 there are some good people but they have 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.750
 insufficient authority there are people 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.800
 with enough authority but they 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.380
 bastards or agents of the Kremlin in my all 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.110
 very simple actually mission 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.470
 the future of the Supreme Council is generally globally 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.750
 I see precisely in this I think I watched 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.700
 on the list of majoritarian looked at 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.090
 list 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.590
 party in each party in each there 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.400
 some decent people don't 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.420
 very much but they are there is some 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.690
 quantity 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.530
 worthy people among majoritarian I 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.860
 I really hope that this mission 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.620
 will be performed in the new Supreme Rada 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.990
 these people no matter what 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.180
 batches are on what list they are 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.460
 were chosen 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.850
 or they came on majoritarian they 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.690
 will come together precisely in order to 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.990
 to support 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.030
 not even president a certain course 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.380
 a certain focus of these 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.840
 action well, I hope so though well 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.600
 life is complex and there is someone there 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.980
 party machine can break can 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.990
 and when a person goes to the party 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.200
 list you should understand that it is this 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:12.580
 the party becomes obliged he loses 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.990
 some part of my free will then 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.080
 there is a deputy who is selected by 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.630
 party list he is no longer free he 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.150
 already partially dependent on political 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.150
 parties well there is some danger
