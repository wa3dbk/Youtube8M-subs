shooting<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> enemies<00:01:54.689> who<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.350> know

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
shooting the enemies who are you know

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.749 
shooting the enemies who are you know
trying<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> inside<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
trying to go on the inside to get the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.120 
trying to go on the inside to get the
flag<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:58.320> shooting

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
flag and you know basically shooting

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
flag and you know basically shooting
them<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.490> behind<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.719> equals<00:02:01.140> more

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
them from behind you know equals more

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.370 
them from behind you know equals more
kills<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.729> kills<00:02:03.119> equals<00:02:03.509> kill<00:02:03.810> streaks<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
kills or kills equals kill streaks and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
kills or kills equals kill streaks and
killstreaks<00:02:04.649> text<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.670> equal<00:02:06.090> even<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.570> kill

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
killstreaks text to equal even more kill

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.630 
killstreaks text to equal even more kill
streaks<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> win-win

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
streaks so you know it's a win-win

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
streaks so you know it's a win-win
situation<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:11.690> guess<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.020> strategy

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
situation and it is a I guess a strategy

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.680 
situation and it is a I guess a strategy
that<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.459> know<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> enemy<00:02:14.910> don't<00:02:15.270> think<00:02:15.510> of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that you know the enemy don't think of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.040 
that you know the enemy don't think of
so<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.349> don't<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.650> look<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:18.720> who's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
so they don't really look to see who's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.530 
so they don't really look to see who's
behind<00:02:19.349> him<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.730> works<00:02:20.940> most<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> time

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
behind him and it works most of the time

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.900 
behind him and it works most of the time
for<00:02:22.020> me<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.470> I'm<00:02:23.099> i<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.310> recommend<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.790> guys
