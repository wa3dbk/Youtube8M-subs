well<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> diamond<00:00:19.050> system<00:00:19.199> I'm<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.590> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
well the diamond system I'm going to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320 
well the diamond system I'm going to
show<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.400> probably<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> most

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
show you now is probably the most

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.090 
show you now is probably the most
popular<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.439> systems<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.980> could

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
popular of all the systems you could

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.279 
popular of all the systems you could
ever<00:00:23.279> learn<00:00:23.519> four<00:00:24.300> years<00:00:24.510> ago<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> used<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.170> be

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
ever learn four years ago it used to be

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
ever learn four years ago it used to be
what<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.650> call<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> standard<00:00:26.400> five<00:00:26.640> or

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what they call the standard five or

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060 
what they call the standard five or
corner<00:00:27.180> system<00:00:27.599> shot<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.890> very

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
corner system shot it was very

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
corner system shot it was very
complicated<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.060> discovered<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.230> few<00:00:31.260> years

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
complicated I discovered a few years

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.889 
complicated I discovered a few years
later<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.940> system<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> show

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
later that this system I'm going to show

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
later that this system I'm going to show
now<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.649> much<00:00:35.190> easier<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> learn

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
now is actually much easier to learn

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
now is actually much easier to learn
it's<00:00:36.390> used<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.870> often<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's used more often and it's going to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's used more often and it's going to
help<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> win<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.399> games<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.879> let's<00:00:38.969> get

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
help you win a lot of games so let's get

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.060 
help you win a lot of games so let's get
right<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> standard<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
right into this this is the standard to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
right into this this is the standard to
cushion<00:00:41.309> kick<00:00:42.210> shot<00:00:42.480> system<00:00:42.960> using<00:00:43.379> numbers

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
cushion kick shot system using numbers

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
cushion kick shot system using numbers
now<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:44.520> simple<00:00:44.879> thing<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
now it's a very simple thing to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.630 
now it's a very simple thing to
calculate<00:00:45.539> easy<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.620> you've<00:00:47.340> got<00:00:47.399> an

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
calculate easy to do you've got an

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.709 
calculate easy to do you've got an
object<00:00:47.910> ball<00:00:48.030> sitting<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
object ball sitting down here in the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.229 
object ball sitting down here in the
corner<00:00:48.840> pocket<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.700> we're<00:00:50.700> blocked<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.120> by

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
corner pocket and we're blocked here by

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.910 
corner pocket and we're blocked here by
a<00:00:51.270> couple<00:00:51.629> balls<00:00:51.809> along<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> long<00:00:52.469> rail<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
a couple balls along the long rail and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.170 
a couple balls along the long rail and
the<00:00:52.980> cue<00:00:53.160> ball<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.520> toward<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.850> into<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the cue ball is up toward that into the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.709 
the cue ball is up toward that into the
table

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
table

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.000 
table
so<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.260> I'm<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.920> I'm

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so what I'm going to do here is I'm

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.380 
so what I'm going to do here is I'm
actually<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> start<00:00:56.699> counting<00:00:56.969> from

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
actually going to start counting from

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.229 
actually going to start counting from
the<00:00:57.719> object<00:00:58.289> ball<00:00:58.440> until<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.579> get<00:00:59.820> close<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the object ball until I get close to the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
the object ball until I get close to the
cue<00:01:00.539> ball<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.140> starts<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
cue ball and it starts out this way the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.469 
cue ball and it starts out this way the
og<00:01:03.210> ball<00:01:03.539> always<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> value<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.100> zero<00:01:05.790> no

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
og ball always has a value of zero no

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.700 
og ball always has a value of zero no
matter<00:01:06.659> where<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.080> along<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> rail<00:01:07.590> if

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
matter where it's at along a rail if

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
matter where it's at along a rail if
it's<00:01:07.799> within<00:01:07.950> an<00:01:08.130> inch<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> rail<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's within an inch of the rail it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
it's within an inch of the rail it
always<00:01:09.689> has<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> value<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.470> zero<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.979> we'll

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
always has a value of zero so we'll

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
always has a value of zero so we'll
start<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.430> zero<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.360> we'll

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
start with zero right there and we'll

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
start with zero right there and we'll
count<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.470> getting<00:01:14.280> close<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> cue<00:01:14.880> ball

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
count up getting close to the cue ball

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
count up getting close to the cue ball
fro<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.479> zero<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.530> first<00:01:16.740> diamond

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
fro from zero to this first diamond

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.469 
fro from zero to this first diamond
which<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.880> end<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.240> diamond

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
which is one the end of one diamond

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
which is one the end of one diamond
segment<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.640> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
segment that would be one this would be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
segment that would be one this would be
the<00:01:20.820> end<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> second<00:01:21.479> diamond<00:01:21.600> system<00:01:21.900> or

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the end of the second diamond system or

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.980 
the end of the second diamond system or
two<00:01:22.350> diamond<00:01:23.250> segment<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.270> would<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> three

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
two diamond segment this would be three

here along the short rail at this point
it<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.229> still<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.619> zero<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.909> 1

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it would still be zero and it would be 1

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.550 
it would still be zero and it would be 1
2<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.290> around<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> corner<00:01:49.920> 3<00:01:50.430> 4<00:01:50.820> 5<00:01:51.180> 6<00:01:51.570> 7<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
2 going around the corner 3 4 5 6 7 and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280 
2 going around the corner 3 4 5 6 7 and
this<00:01:53.430> 4<00:01:53.640> over<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:53.880> at<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.540> diamond<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this 4 over here at this diamond it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.730 
this 4 over here at this diamond it
would<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.560> 0<00:01:55.860> 1<00:01:56.100> 2<00:01:56.880> 3<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.869> again<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.500> always

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
would be 0 1 2 3 so again this is always

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
would be 0 1 2 3 so again this is always
zero<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.549> starting<00:01:59.939> point<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.299> your

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
zero the starting point of your

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.530 
zero the starting point of your

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
up to 5 and that number 5 tells you what

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
up to 5 and that number 5 tells you what

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
5 this is 6 7 8 9 so we have nine

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.880 
5 this is 6 7 8 9 so we have nine

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
diamonds over there along that rail so 1

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.390 
diamonds over there along that rail so 1
2<00:02:43.220> 3<00:02:43.250> 4<00:02:43.640> 5<00:02:44.120> 6<00:02:44.330> 7<00:02:44.510> 8<00:02:44.750> 9<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.260> generically<00:02:46.250> the

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and generically the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.220 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and generically the
length<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:46.970> table<00:02:47.390> we<00:02:47.840> have<00:02:48.019> nine

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
length of the table we have nine

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
length of the table we have nine
diamonds<00:02:48.739> which<00:02:49.070> we<00:02:49.220> explained<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.670> our<00:02:49.760> in

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
diamonds which we explained in our in

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.790 
diamonds which we explained in our in
our<00:02:50.000> terminology<00:02:50.420> segment<00:02:51.080> 1<00:02:51.440> 2<00:02:51.769> 3<00:02:52.250> 4<00:02:52.700> 5<00:02:53.209> 6<00:02:53.750> 7<00:02:54.410> 8

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
our terminology segment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.790 
our terminology segment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:56.209> I've<00:02:56.780> actually<00:02:56.989> made<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.410> into<00:02:57.709> a

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
9 so I've actually made this into a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.280 
9 so I've actually made this into a
square<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.430> whole<00:02:58.640> concept<00:02:59.030> here<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.750> to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
square and the whole concept here is to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.110 
square and the whole concept here is to
use<00:03:00.500> what's<00:03:00.920> called<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.220> Euclidean<00:03:01.459> principle

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
use what's called a Euclidean principle

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.970 
use what's called a Euclidean principle
of<00:03:02.180> mathematics<00:03:02.660> or<00:03:02.750> square<00:03:03.019> principle<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.950> I

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
of mathematics or square principle so I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.350 
of mathematics or square principle so I
basically<00:03:04.430> convert<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> table<00:03:05.150> into<00:03:05.300> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
basically convert the table into a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.780 
basically convert the table into a
square<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:05.900> come<00:03:06.050> up<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.319> five<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:07.430> go<00:03:07.580> over

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
square so we come up to five we go over

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.790 
square so we come up to five we go over
to<00:03:07.910> five<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.330> when<00:03:08.840> we<00:03:08.959> connect<00:03:09.319> five<00:03:09.560> with

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
to five and when we connect five with

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.830 
to five and when we connect five with
five<00:03:10.040> you'll<00:03:11.000> notice<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.330> cue<00:03:11.510> balls<00:03:11.690> right

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
five you'll notice the cue balls right

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.930 
five you'll notice the cue balls right
on<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.140> line<00:03:12.350> that's<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.830> track<00:03:13.069> line<00:03:13.370> that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
on that line that's the track line that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.610 
on that line that's the track line that
we<00:03:14.030> talked<00:03:14.269> about<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.690> our<00:03:14.750> terminology<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
we talked about in our terminology and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.410 
we talked about in our terminology and
then<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.459> course<00:03:16.670> if<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.850> look<00:03:16.970> at<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> track

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
then of course if you look at the track

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.670 
then of course if you look at the track
line<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:18.019> creates<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.790> triangle<00:03:20.530> which<00:03:21.530> we

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
line it creates this triangle which we

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.860 
line it creates this triangle which we
also<00:03:21.829> talked<00:03:22.280> about<00:03:22.370> earlier<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.030> also

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
also talked about earlier and that also

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.600 
also talked about earlier and that also
creates<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.560> acute<00:03:24.890> angle<00:03:25.220> which<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.370> your

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
creates the acute angle which is your

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.850 
creates the acute angle which is your
kick<00:03:25.790> angle<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.329> rail<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.260> five<00:03:27.500> five

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
kick angle to the rail so the five five

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.030 
kick angle to the rail so the five five
track<00:03:28.250> line<00:03:28.549> creates<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:30.470> line<00:03:30.739> that<00:03:30.980> you

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
track line creates the line that you

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.380 
track line creates the line that you
must<00:03:31.280> shoot<00:03:31.489> down<00:03:31.730> now<00:03:31.880> once<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.209> do<00:03:32.269> that

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
must shoot down now once I do that

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.720 
must shoot down now once I do that
calculation<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.200> five<00:03:33.380> five<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:34.070> don't

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
calculation of five five I don't

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.310 
calculation of five five I don't
basically<00:03:35.120> look<00:03:35.269> at<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.480> cushion<00:03:35.660> or<00:03:35.930> that

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
basically look at the cushion or that

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.780 
basically look at the cushion or that
diamond<00:03:36.680> over<00:03:36.769> there<00:03:36.920> anymore<00:03:37.130> what<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.430> do<00:03:37.549> is

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
diamond over there anymore what I do is

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.780 
diamond over there anymore what I do is
I<00:03:37.910> simply<00:03:38.120> shoot<00:03:38.600> down<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.799> little<00:03:40.310> six<00:03:40.670> to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
I simply shoot down a little six to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.610 
I simply shoot down a little six to
eight<00:03:40.940> inch<00:03:41.120> line<00:03:41.450> on<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:42.109> side<00:03:42.320> of<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.470> cue

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
eight inch line on that side of the cue

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.740 
eight inch line on that side of the cue
ball<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.519> that's<00:03:43.730> your<00:03:43.880> job<00:03:43.940> shoot<00:03:44.390> down<00:03:44.570> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
ball so that's your job shoot down the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.720 
ball so that's your job shoot down the
line<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.680> byproduct<00:03:46.040> should<00:03:46.459> end<00:03:46.609> up

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
line and the byproduct should end up

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.550 
line and the byproduct should end up
down<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.840> ball<00:03:48.079> let's<00:03:48.260> go<00:03:48.350> ahead<00:03:48.410> and

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
down to this ball let's go ahead and

remember<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.209> mentioned<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:08.690> ball<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.049> always

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
remember I mentioned this ball is always

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.090 
remember I mentioned this ball is always
zero<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:10.880> is<00:04:11.090> one<00:04:11.329> two<00:04:11.720> three<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.920> course

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
zero this is one two three and of course

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.370 
zero this is one two three and of course
the<00:04:13.190> diamond<00:04:13.609> at<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:14.390> side<00:04:14.600> pocket<00:04:15.049> is<00:04:15.109> in<00:04:15.290> the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
the diamond at the side pocket is in the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.750 
the diamond at the side pocket is in the
center<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.799> pocket<00:04:16.190> in<00:04:16.310> line<00:04:16.549> with<00:04:16.669> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
center of the pocket in line with the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.690 
center of the pocket in line with the
diamonds<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.709> zero<00:04:18.709> one<00:04:18.919> two<00:04:19.100> three<00:04:19.130> we<00:04:19.549> want

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
diamonds so zero one two three we want

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.399 
diamonds so zero one two three we want
to<00:04:19.760> look<00:04:19.850> for<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.060> three<00:04:20.299> over<00:04:20.329> here<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
to look for a three over here so the

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.770 
to look for a three over here so the
corner<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.830> one<00:04:22.070> two<00:04:22.849> half<00:04:23.030> diamond<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.510> two

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
corner is one two half diamond is two

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.510 
corner is one two half diamond is two
this<00:04:24.200> is<00:04:24.260> three<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.800> we<00:04:24.890> connect<00:04:25.190> three<00:04:25.400> two

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
this is three and we connect three two

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.710 
this is three and we connect three two
three<00:04:25.700> now

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
three now

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.240 
three now
this<00:04:26.840> particular<00:04:27.140> case<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.650> cueball<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.100> not

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
this particular case the cueball is not

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.390 
this particular case the cueball is not
on<00:04:28.550> three<00:04:29.270> two<00:04:29.390> three<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.350> we<00:04:30.740> go<00:04:30.890> into<00:04:31.070> what<00:04:31.280> we

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
on three two three so we go into what we

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.010 
on three two three so we go into what we
call<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.700> parallel<00:04:32.060> shift<00:04:32.300> mode<00:04:32.540> which<00:04:32.750> we

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
call the parallel shift mode which we

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.960 
call the parallel shift mode which we
explained<00:04:33.350> before<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:34.160> simply<00:04:34.550> move<00:04:34.700> over

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
explained before we simply move over

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.690 
explained before we simply move over
parallel<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.990> cue<00:04:36.380> ball<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.520> gives

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
parallel to the cue ball and that gives

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.280 
parallel to the cue ball and that gives
you<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.910> same<00:04:38.150> angle<00:04:38.540> into<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.750> rail<00:04:38.960> so

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
you the same angle into the rail so

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.020 
you the same angle into the rail so
three<00:04:39.650> three<00:04:39.950> is<00:04:40.010> your<00:04:40.100> calculated<00:04:40.610> angle

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
three three is your calculated angle

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.780 
three three is your calculated angle
moving<00:04:41.780> over<00:04:41.960> parallel<00:04:42.350> gives<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.640> angle

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
moving over parallel gives you the angle

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.280 
moving over parallel gives you the angle
or<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> line<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.630> shoot<00:04:44.870> down<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:45.200> we're

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
or the line you shoot down so we're

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.420 
or the line you shoot down so we're
going<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.440> shoot<00:04:45.650> right<00:04:45.830> down<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.220> line

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
going to shoot right down that line

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.340 
going to shoot right down that line
we're<00:04:47.150> going<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.330> increase<00:04:47.720> our<00:04:47.930> English<00:04:48.200> just

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
we're going to increase our English just

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.620 
over comes down like dad hits it that
way<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.430> gets<00:04:55.850> real<00:04:56.030> close<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.420> corner

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
way and gets real close to the corner

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.310 
way and gets real close to the corner
pocket<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.700> actually<00:04:58.700> it<00:04:58.790> falls<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.330> so<00:05:00.080> a

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
pocket and actually it falls in so a

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.810 
pocket and actually it falls in so a
little<00:05:00.500> miracle<00:05:00.980> took<00:05:01.100> place<00:05:01.160> here<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.640> ball

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
little miracle took place here the ball

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.490 
little miracle took place here the ball
went<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.180> my<00:05:02.720> opponent<00:05:03.050> wants<00:05:03.200> to<00:05:03.260> know<00:05:03.350> how<00:05:03.470> I

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
went in my opponent wants to know how I

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.020 
went in my opponent wants to know how I
did<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:04.010> well<00:05:04.310> they<00:05:04.400> learned<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.700> diamond

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
did that well they learned a diamond

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.490 
did that well they learned a diamond
system<00:05:05.180> just<00:05:05.480> like<00:05:05.540> you're<00:05:05.780> learning<00:05:05.900> now<00:05:06.230> so

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
system just like you're learning now so

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.410 
system just like you're learning now so
it's<00:05:06.650> kind<00:05:07.070> of<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.220> neat<00:05:07.400> way<00:05:07.670> that<00:05:07.880> works<00:05:08.120> and

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
it's kind of a neat way that works and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.940 
it's kind of a neat way that works and
of<00:05:08.810> course<00:05:08.990> there's<00:05:09.140> other<00:05:09.290> variations<00:05:09.830> on

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
of course there's other variations on

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.410 
of course there's other variations on
the<00:05:10.040> table<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.550> could<00:05:10.670> have<00:05:10.790> a<00:05:10.820> ball<00:05:11.030> on<00:05:11.240> this

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
the table you could have a ball on this

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.390 
the table you could have a ball on this
rail<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:12.350> could<00:05:12.440> have<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.680> cue<00:05:12.860> ball<00:05:13.040> up<00:05:13.100> here

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
rail you could have the cue ball up here

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.600 
rail you could have the cue ball up here
and<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:14.150> could<00:05:14.330> count<00:05:14.480> from<00:05:14.600> this<00:05:14.870> side<00:05:15.110> 0<00:05:15.770> 1<00:05:16.220> 2

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
and you could count from this side 0 1 2

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.960 
and you could count from this side 0 1 2
3<00:05:16.640> 4<00:05:17.450> 5<00:05:17.780> go<00:05:18.620> over<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.860> 5<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.340> shoot<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:19.820> get

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
3 4 5 go over to 5 and shoot and you get

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.400 
3 4 5 go over to 5 and shoot and you get
the<00:05:20.090> same<00:05:20.240> effect<00:05:20.390> and<00:05:20.660> hit<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.900> ball<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.290> the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
the same effect and hit the ball so the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.490 
the same effect and hit the ball so the
whole<00:05:21.530> concept<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.880> use<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:24.290> cushion

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
whole concept is to use the to cushion

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.890 
whole concept is to use the to cushion

be able to make contact on the balls at

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.330 
be able to make contact on the balls at
least<00:05:38.690> almost<00:05:38.960> every<00:05:39.200> time<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.710> in<00:05:40.160> most

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
cases you're going to make it which is

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.120 
cases you're going to make it which is
going<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.140> make<00:05:42.410> your<00:05:42.530> game<00:05:42.710> go<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:42.979> an

going to make your game go to an

going to make your game go to an
entirely<00:05:43.430> different<00:05:43.580> level<00:05:43.790> so<00:05:44.210> I<00:05:44.600> hope

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810
