00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.390
 to 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.390
 ah 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.780
 welcome everyone to jassam boxing my 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.910
 name rubÃ©n I come talking about the 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
 application weather weather book good 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.990
 I talk about the web application of the book 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.750
 the truth is that I come to tell a little 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.189
 how it works because an application of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.099
 the one that I'm constantly asked 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.570
 Once I make a video almost always finished 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.369
 receiving some comment from someone or 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.500
 Any question where you ask me 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.489
 what is the application that I use for 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.260
 that appears here in the bar 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.489
 notifications on time and also here 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.989
 above you see that the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.910
 temperature in this case at this time 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.920
 it's 15 degrees 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.720
 well, it also makes a framing book 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.100
 I have used it for like four 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.350
 years out there when I bought the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.659
 magic assistant looking for an application 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.400
 for the time I found this and it has gone 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.220
 evolving a lot at the beginning we 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.989
 I was going out here, I did not go out the time 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.280
 notification bar or anything but 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.650
 good with time has been evolving 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 so it is quite well to them 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.189
 I recommend and it has two good versions 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.020
 about webber push tell you that there are 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.880
 two different versions one is webber 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520
 book and the other web of the elite ship a 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.810
 time of payment is worth it for you to know 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.310
 I tell you that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.140
 the truth that I have the elite the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.880
 elite version that I bought it makes 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.320
 very much time I believe that in his day 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.790
 there was quite a difference between one and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 another one I do not remember exactly I do not know if 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.380
 it was a widget or something like that but nowadays 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.149
 practically a difference so 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.369
 you can download google book from 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.890
 free or download web 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.840
 elite and good at least make a 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.729
 donation the truth is that neither is 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.490
 face application so good once 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990
 that you enter you already know that if you want 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.479
 you can use the free version the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 install and download and well 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.119
 I'm going to show you a little how this works 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.450
 good application once the application 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.100
 is downloaded installed we open it and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.600
 automatically we are going to configure 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.890
 the location where we are 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.080
 normally it detects it in a way 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.640
 automatic but in the case that it does not 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.619
 we configured it is worth in my case 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.810
 you see that it detects xerez spain and is 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.580
 correct also tells me that there are 15 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.280
 degrees and well he also tells me even 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.709
 the wind for example northeast direction 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.209
 27 kilometers now all this is worth it 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.150
 can customize more or less and also 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.459
 because here below it gives us all the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.829
 week by Wednesday rainfall 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.780
 sunny Thursday on Friday a little 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.590
 partially on one side is quite 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.420
 well the truth 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.489
 It's very good and what I like the most 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.830
 Of course it is to wash notifications 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.450
 that gives you time here quickly you 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.190
 gives the maximum temperature and temperature 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.930
 minimal and good because it tells you the time 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.250
 general in this case because mostly 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.590
 cloudy and it is correct at this time 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.450
 Mostly cloudy and 15 degrees is worth 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.069
 well how do you do it? 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.599
 normally I tell you that it detects 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.760
 automatically but in case 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.549
 we do not go into the options here in the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.739
 menu we give preference and good 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.200
 first set units units 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.209
 here you already know that depending on where 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.010
 you are then you can place one or the other 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.420
 Well, I know it depends on the country . 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.370
 measure for example instead of kilometers 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.510
 per hour miles per hour or do not know in 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.390
 other units 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.000
 me in my case the standard metric and 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.829
 also in wind you need that the units 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.239
 of wind goes the wind speed I 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.549
 I put kilometers per hour you can put 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.250
 also miles per hour or notes that you do not 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.290
 I have no idea what it is so nothing 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.849
 you use what you want to tell you too 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.069
 that you can set the frequency 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.629
 with which it is updated I recommend the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.280
 what he normally uses is an hour I think 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.510
 that comes by default like that but I 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.040
 I recommend that you put one more hour or 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.200
 less because if you put it every 15 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.270
 minutes as it is also possible 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.010
 that the battery is going to see it because 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.410
 every 15 minutes you have to make a 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.030
 location with your gps see where 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.519
 you are or by triangulation of antennas 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.349
 to know where you are and then do the 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.090
 location check with the server 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.190
 what is the temperature what are the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 weather data and then update them if 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 you do it every 15 minutes I assure you that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.830
 it shows so the ideal is to put it to 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.030
 each one every two hours more is more or 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.400
 less worth 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.650
 then tell you that I usually what 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.030
 I do is this in tree my location that 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.610
 what it does is that it allows an application 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.190
 let it follow you know your position or 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.590
 either by triangulation of antennas or 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.060
 by gps the application will try 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.400
 know where it is to be updated 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.519
 why do this because I really 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.170
 You can manually add the 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.049
 locations if for example I 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.390
 I would like to see the temperature or the weather 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.729
 General of Seville to say a city 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.639
 I give here to location and I could put 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.430
 sevilla would look for me and allow me 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.220
 add it is ok and here you can see how I 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.080
 says seville in colombia would be ohio 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.040
 sevilla in spain I can give and I 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.210
 add 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.070
 what happens with this that if you go 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.120
 moving and it moves you from one place 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.770
 to another is a person who travels 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.150
 moderately with you leaving your 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 province because you are not giving yourself the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.210
 right temperature is giving you if you 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.340
 you tell him here Seville is giving you 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.410
 sevilla what I do is give my 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.790
 location which is my position and this what 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.100
 who commented before if we are in 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.690
 preference and we give anabel my 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.370
 location what is this here what 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.590
 lets is it to follow you towards the program 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.030
 he automatically detects where he is and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.620
 once you have it located and you 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.180
 can show the time of that city in 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.280
 concrete and it does not show you what you 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.470
 manually mark I recommend also 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.780
 that you use this the truth because good is 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.610
 quicker and more effective and a day of 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.930
 trip if you forget to put the city to 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.490
 the one that is going to go is easier than 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.440
 directly the phone is updated and 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.430
 I say good, I realize that I do not 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.169
 they are and you want to be in 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.360
 sevilla or now you are in madrid and the 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.770
 temperature there is so much worth so 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.300
 nothing for you to know what to see 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.370
 simple is already configured 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.800
 ok application I told you to follow me 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.690
 that I want you to be able to 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.760
 trace if you want I 've also told you 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.320
 around here that the wind units and 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.910
 the units that I want you to use 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.410
 to tell me achieved and others I can 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.810
 put it in degrees Kelvin or degrees 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.860
 centigrade and you can put it in units 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.810
 miles per hour km per hour once 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.070
 configure and exit and up here to the 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.290
 left because you will have the 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.510
 temperature in this case they mark me 15 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.770
 degrees Celsius is the temperature that 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.930
 There's right now in Jerez de la Frontera 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.400
 and here when it takes off at the bar 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.139
 notifications you will always have a 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.550
 incognito the truth is that I like the 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.200
 appearance that this application has is 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.270
 simple is pretty and is simple and 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.100
 effective you already do not need anything else 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.600
 ok and well I already have there that is 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.580
 partially cloudy at this time in 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.590
 jerte the border if you want and I tell you 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.120
 you can manually add other 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.100
 cities but good the ideal is that 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.280
 put yours or add mails ok 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.960
 that automatically drag and continue to 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.760
 know where it is and can show the 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.169
 time of that city in particular and good 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.729
 I also mean that if the fret there is a 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.139
 little then you will see that it has much more 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.820
 options that good that you can see here 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.560
 for example that shows the time 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.389
 otherwise different from all the 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.310
 week either maximum temperature and 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.810
 minimum either sunny diets is 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.360
 Mostly cloudy if partially 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.130
 cloudy or precipitations or whatever 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.560
 You can also see that it has some 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.270
 recommendations let's say where there are 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.800
 golf courses near my area and things 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.449
 so you can really do that 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.580
 better with google now 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.229
 applications but you can tune well 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.430
 what you will see here for example good 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.229
 rainfall not only 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.809
