down the low friction bearings rotate

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:07.859 
smoothly and allow the wheel to be

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.249 
smoothly and allow the wheel to be

part of the wheel will always rotate

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
part of the wheel will always rotate
downwards<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.990> idea<00:01:13.289> is<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.469> put<00:01:13.710> an

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

equal<00:01:14.159> amount<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.490> weight<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.969> opposite

optional wheel alignment indicator is

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.719 
optional wheel alignment indicator is
useful<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.069> if<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.310> wheels<00:01:20.520> are

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
useful to see if your wheels are

useful to see if your wheels are
straight<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.539> it's<00:01:21.659> especially<00:01:21.990> useful<00:01:22.200> for
