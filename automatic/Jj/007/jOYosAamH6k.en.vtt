 and there people on youtube settlers here to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400

 some questions about l 6 volts 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.039
 how many this kind of thing first 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.890
 can i use my online pass code back 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.869
 in American account and play against and br 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 I can also download it must be in the account 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 and use br br or vice versa 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.610
 of the account or mobile phone nokia or vice versa 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.380
 of the American br&gt; account 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 The answer is yes, my dear friend. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.120
 see games released in Brazil and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 united states are region 1 like you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.559
 You must be seeing this photo now and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.690
 region one is for two americans 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.730
 then you can download and use the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.770
 code that comes with some game in a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.620
 United States and take advantage of this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 content also downloaded to the br 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 the that you can not do is use the code 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 of a European game in an American account 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 for example the game must be the same 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.860
 region of account or the account must be in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.260
 same region of the game without understanding what 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.820
 the online code pass the album should be 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 downloaded work 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.159
 if you buy a dlc in an account 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.950
 the game must be from region 2 that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.290
 the region in pabx so you can 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.330
 use this idea feel and joÃ£o a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.330
 American region to the two European 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.340
 region 3 is Asian should have some photo 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.540
 and also to show where you see the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.270
 region of the game 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.100
 in the case of my skyrim from my gta 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.259
 region of the game for the part of the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 euro kate not on the side like the games 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.340
 of region one are usually something else 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.200
 what can happen is you try 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 use a game code that is 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 region one at a br point and a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.149
 error message saying that the code already 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.640
 must have been used has expired or should have 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.979
 been typed wrong do not despair 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.409
 What do I explain why? 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.780
 This is because even this story 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.490
 Brazil is less complete that even this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.950
 united states history 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.540
 Whatever you want to call it 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.510
 so in this case that happened to me 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.880
 that's my best 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.760
 while per suite you should use the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.620
 code in the US account and from there 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.920
 play normally on both accounts 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.090
 that we reinforce are both 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.060
 region 1 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.400
 summarizing caution unlike a game 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.590
 verify that it is from the same region as 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.860
 which you want to play by remembering 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.390
 once again that American account npr are 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.530
 of region 1 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.720
 I think it's just that even I wanted to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.490
 speak this video if they liked 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.200
 if you try to help in any way 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.060
 be sure to evaluate with the joinha more 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.550
 Favorite that is always good always leaves 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.410
 happy 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.520
 that is not registered in the channel still 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.410
 subscribe 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.450
 if you have questions still that 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.820
 complement anything that you 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.590
 do you think that the only one who speaks there 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.990
 who read it if necessary some 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.760
 question I will answer hope this 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.400
 video make doubts many people do not 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.400
 I'm over here and until the next
