00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.049
 saw the French number in Friday at the last expansion of the nursery 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.339
 the need for the cultivation m delivery between them to the of options 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.339
 and to streamline dendrobium from that to be carried out more 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.109
 to also better deal with market demand for more targeted detection and investigation 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.640
 To be able to deliver specific mixtures it has been decided to use WPS horti 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.899
 systems to realize a clinic plant orders system 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.010
 This system offers the option of using LF from that technology 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.809
 register and track individual customer level customers 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.210
 from that moment of sticks are highly targeted orders it specific planting 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.830
 to put together 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.570
 in the system, plants are manually estimated and selected by the container 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 there are of course several positions available for this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.580
 plants are only estimated if they can stop within a few weeks 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.400
 to become 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.750
 on a screen it is indicated which type is in the container 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.820
 decisions can be made at the exchange positions 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 a plant must or must not be stopped immediately 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.070
 depending on the position where the plant is numbered during flowering 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.539
 a plant may or may not be discharged from both stop-stitch positions 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440
 after being placed in the flowering timer, the plant is drained in the direction 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.300
 of the stocks filling stations 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.060
 plants that do not have to be stopped will be informed 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.140
 and then discharged to the sorting buffer 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.229
 plants that do need to be stopped 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.669
 are distributed demand-driven over the various stops tec positions 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.350
 on this stick sticking out positions the plant from flowering room up 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 printed after which the employee 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.330
 the relevant customer can place on a work table and can update 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.920
 while the customer is stopped, the next customer is prepared in advance 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.710
 method 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.850
 therefore also ensures continuous progress of the stoc stitch process with this 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.560
 minimum waiting times and at the same time optimum visibility of the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 customer to process it correctly 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.820
 Stopped plants are taken to the 2060 square 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.979
 if desired, the plants were given water 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.489
 through a plan unit 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.260
 the plants are judged here, among other things, by number of branches number 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.699
 buttons and height 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.909
 plants that there are still no delivery true 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.549
 are transported to the sorting buffer for sorting 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.859
 are put away 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.170
 from a kind of honorary citizen for the plants 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.289
 automatically sent to a reset robot 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.119
 application of the sorting guarantees that the containers are running 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.859
 be returned to the greenhouse and be as unique for possible content 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.679
 This makes it possible to fill the delivery for highly targeted 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.310
 delivery where the plants can optionally be automatically or manually from the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.859
 container to be picked up 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.859
 these plants are also transported to the vision systems plan 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.379
 based on the data from this system 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.449
 it is determined whether a plant can indeed be delivered in a class or if it is available again 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.249
 back to the container 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.669
 survive birth plants are transported to the upper layer 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.930
 the plants are fed into one of the seven rotating buffers on the top layer 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:12.890
 rotating buffers 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.390
 offer the possibility of many times more sorting in a buffer 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.010
 place 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.849
 than with a conventional delivery system 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.319
 In many conventional systems, customers are just starting the renovation 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.179
 may contain sorting 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:30.059
 special rotations can be made by rotating the plants within the buffer 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.139
 needed for a corner from the system 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.280
 through the development of the system 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.410
 we can gradually rotate the plants into one during rotation 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.580
 continuous flow, but minimal due to the load on the plant 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.419
 is 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.589
 as a result, this principle of buses and as a delivery is very suitable for sensitive 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.829
 plants in combination with many grades 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.919
 During these processes it is possible to have customers based on the latter 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.289
 provides water with a quantity of water 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.689
 This means that if, for example, a customer does not stay longer than a day 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.750
 has benefited 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.949
 will get it through the plant sprint with water 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.889
 customers who have less than a day who have not had water 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.889
 you will talk to the plant passing without getting water 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.489
 if a corner is entered in the order side such as software 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.340
 This results in reserving customers in the area 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.940
 the reserved plants 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.599
 are hidden in the roller bank and placed on a central conveyor 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.330
 the order of these plants 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.860
 does not yet match the desired order on the in this stage 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.309
 packing station 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.169
 order is collected on the top layer in the collection buffer 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.930
 every big this buffer 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.909
 can contain the contents of a complete car 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.780
 as soon as all the plants for a cart are placed in the collected front 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.469
 is sent to the impact stations in order 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.389
 the plants are broken down in the limburger 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.430
 that order all the different sortings for a corner 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.430
 placed on a large scale 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.080
 from these large cores the plants then inpex active correct order 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.770
 but the packing stations are sent 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.370
 This gives the impact employee the opportunity to follow closely 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.969
 to pack customers and place them on the map 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.929
 it can happen that a customer arrives at the packing station that does not comply 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.889
 to the quality requirements that are set at times 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.639
 this may be because a plant has an illness or damage 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.719
 in this case it is possible to create one for that plant with the push of a button 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.400
 substitute the plant 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.380
 the system will then send a plant from the delivery in advance which is satisfactory 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.439
 same characteristics as the rejected plant 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.150
 this plant will then be offered at a few parts 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.290
 so that the cart can still be made or made
