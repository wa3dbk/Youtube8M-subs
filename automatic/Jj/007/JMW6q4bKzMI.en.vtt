00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and data sets and basically what we're

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
and data sets and basically what we're
going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> start<00:01:00.270> looking<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.410> next

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
going to start looking at in this next

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
going to start looking at in this next
group<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.730> next<00:01:03.059> series<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> tutorials

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
group or this next series of tutorials

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.580 
group or this next series of tutorials
is<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:05.159> else<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.700> spry<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.080> offer<00:01:07.260> us

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
is what else that spry has to offer us

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.539 
is what else that spry has to offer us
as<00:01:07.860> web<00:01:08.580> designers<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.490> first

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
as web designers so in this first

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.270 
as web designers so in this first
tutorial<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.720> go<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.040> what<00:01:14.040> are

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
tutorial we're going to go over what are

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
tutorial we're going to go over what are
called<00:01:14.610> tabbed<00:01:15.330> panels<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:18.170> guess<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
called tabbed panels and I guess the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.620 
called tabbed panels and I guess the
best<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.189> describe<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:21.060> tabbed<00:01:21.780> panel<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
best way to describe a tabbed panel is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
best way to describe a tabbed panel is
basically<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.310> web<00:01:26.310> page<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> panel<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.840> has

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
basically a web page or a panel that has

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.830 
basically a web page or a panel that has
different<00:01:29.490> tabs<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:29.970> top<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> can

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
different tabs at the top that you can

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.370 
different tabs at the top that you can
move<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.270> without<00:01:33.570> actually

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
move in and out of without actually

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
move in and out of without actually
leaving<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> web<00:01:35.070> page<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
leaving the web page so it's all in the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.899 
leaving the web page so it's all in the
one<00:01:37.460> specific<00:01:38.460> HTML<00:01:39.060> document<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> let's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
one specific HTML document and so let's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
one specific HTML document and so let's
let's<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.479> started<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.990> creating<00:01:43.500> some

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
let's get started in creating some

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.889 
let's get started in creating some
tabbed<00:01:44.820> panels<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.640> started<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.720> need

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
tabbed panels to get started all we need

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.990 
tabbed panels to get started all we need
to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.979> over<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.630> changed<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:53.000> not

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to do is go over here I changed my not

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
to do is go over here I changed my not
forms<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.930> forms<00:01:55.229> anymore<00:01:55.530> it's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
forms it's not forms anymore it's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.330 
forms it's not forms anymore it's
actually<00:01:56.009> spry<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
actually spry so we can see all of the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850 
actually spry so we can see all of the
different<00:01:59.369> spry<00:02:00.030> elements<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.350> inside

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
different spry elements that are inside

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.760 
different spry elements that are inside
Dreamweaver<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:04.259> first<00:02:04.500> thing<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.680> going

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
Dreamweaver so the first thing I'm going

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.980 
Dreamweaver so the first thing I'm going
to<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.219> click<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:05.880> spry<00:02:06.630> tabbed<00:02:07.020> panels

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
to do is click on spry tabbed panels

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.710 
to do is click on spry tabbed panels
and<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.190> can<00:02:09.340> see<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.819> just<00:02:10.000> imported<00:02:10.509> a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
and you can see that it just imported a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.000 
and you can see that it just imported a
fair<00:02:11.140> amount<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.410> code<00:02:13.260> imported<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.500> parent

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
fair amount of code imported this parent

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.850 
fair amount of code imported this parent
div<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.730> called<00:02:15.970> tab<00:02:16.330> panels<00:02:16.840> one<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.510> also

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
div it's called tab panels one and also

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.210 
div it's called tab panels one and also
created<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.280> unordered<00:02:21.910> list<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:23.220> another

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
created this unordered list and another

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.850 
created this unordered list and another
div<00:02:25.410> called<00:02:26.410> tab<00:02:27.130> panels<00:02:27.550> content<00:02:28.030> group<00:02:28.860> so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
div called tab panels content group so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.780 
div called tab panels content group so
