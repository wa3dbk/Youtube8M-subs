00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 I miss my land besides a work 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.990
 You 're going to play, I'm not playing straight where you 're going. 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.599
 the two versions that I know the most 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:16.020
 traditional that changes little only changes 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.240
 focus and make a video pretty cool you 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.250
 take this song make the video solo 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 The singer will play but I will not do the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.699
 video only show a little bit to 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.939
 easy for you does not get too big 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.939
 it is 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.920
 it's a 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 is that the old 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 the goal 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 looks 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.390
 Let's make a video of the avaí already 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.770
 for you to take the ground first in the tone of 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.470
 rear 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:31.360
 the first symbian version coming out here is 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.360
 a world apart 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:43.690
 repeats the first being easy attached as 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.690
 attests at sea goes up sixth 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.789
 the goal 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480
 in good condition 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.250
 O 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.640
 the goal 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.120
 not the other version would attack instead 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:13.090
 of a long touch would be to attack three 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.480
 touches shorter for using all 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.480
 the fingers 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.840
 there in the sun same thing and it interests 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.079
 or even roof 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.200
 see that it does not close our 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.129
 money 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.129
 see part for basket 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.460
 it has a more traditional version 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.460
 and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.120
 ae 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.030
 changed only in the final finishes and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:12.600
 will be there in the document she would be 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:15.590
 sure even easier typing 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.590
 for me 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.590
 now it does not go to silence, I only love you 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.590
 already makes the basket to follow us sun 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.879
 and the other would be the rich three touches like 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.079
 from an example in the major 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.079
 aquino of the greatest partnership 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.750
 is 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.460
 under here under the clothes 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.350
 I'm using here so you can 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:25.470
 I also use the bass to interact 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:36.000
 here alternating down the front here right? 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:38.130
 is enough for 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.410
 help cool look that is easy to 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.730
 understanding that will help to build this 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.520
 first step for you that is 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.070
 initiating the call to the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.160
 guarânia it is a bit more complicated 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:56.100
 so it will play exactly together later 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.170
 of the three touches papa see that in the last 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.280
 touched down the set by one in the 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.280
 last note 2 low 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.880
 in the last round the low 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:20.030
 the last one rang 2 to 1 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.430
 but the time stopped neither and I think 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.430
 made it much easier for you to 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.870
 a straw here from the corner in C, but not 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.460
 Can I make a detail that the video goes? 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.670
 become very big so I'll give a 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.670
 straw 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.020
 the forró 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.020
 the goal 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.039
 op leaves I always leave one of them 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.039
 left over to have a return feature 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.630
 the othon 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.559
 the avaí 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.450
 if you have patience use the fingering 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.490
 that I'm using here you're going to take 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.920
 she is very easygoing that I'm doing 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:31.410
 here an example an intense scale of do 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:37.020
 I would be typing this I'm here 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:46.370
 using that 35 and I'll repeat here part 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:46.370
 of the sun would be C major op 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.180
 I hope to help and now it's more classic 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.010
 more original zinho 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.630
 we know that in the end there are several 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.630
 resources you can use to end and 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.290
 flushed chamamé that is the answer
