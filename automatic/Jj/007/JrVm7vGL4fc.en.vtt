like<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.820> name<00:00:53.030> Chadha<00:00:53.390> what<00:00:53.629> came<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:53.960> our

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
like the name Chadha what came to our

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.649 
like the name Chadha what came to our
mind<00:00:54.500> when<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:54.829> started<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.460> project<00:00:55.699> that

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
mind when we started this project that

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.770 
mind when we started this project that
is<00:00:56.809> because<00:00:57.140> as<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.489> shadow<00:00:58.760> follows<00:00:59.089> the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
is because as the shadow follows the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.670 
is because as the shadow follows the
human<00:01:00.170> motions

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
human motions

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.610

now<00:07:08.479> that<00:07:09.319> is<00:07:09.469> my<00:07:09.740> right<00:07:09.979> leg<00:07:10.370> the<00:07:10.969> robot<00:07:11.389> also

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
now that is my right leg the robot also

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.709 
now that is my right leg the robot also
lived<00:07:12.199> its<00:07:12.620> right<00:07:12.860> leg<00:07:13.190> and<00:07:13.520> placed<00:07:14.180> on<00:07:14.479> the

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719 
lived its right leg and placed on the

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:17.260 
lived its right leg and placed on the
ground<00:07:15.020> simultaneously<00:07:15.620> and<00:07:16.460> come<00:07:16.940> to<00:07:17.150> its

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
ground simultaneously and come to its

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.689 
ground simultaneously and come to its
initial<00:07:17.750> position<00:07:18.039> again<00:07:19.039> to<00:07:19.280> maintain<00:07:19.400> the

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 
initial position again to maintain the

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:21.820 
initial position again to maintain the
center<00:07:19.969> of<00:07:20.090> gravity<00:07:20.659> as<00:07:21.020> told<00:07:21.379> by<00:07:21.440> the<00:07:21.560> human

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
center of gravity as told by the human

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.850 
center of gravity as told by the human
brain<00:07:22.099> now<00:07:22.669> as<00:07:22.940> you<00:07:23.210> can<00:07:23.360> see<00:07:23.419> to<00:07:24.380> maintain<00:07:24.710> the

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
brain now as you can see to maintain the

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.300 
brain now as you can see to maintain the
center<00:07:25.130> of<00:07:25.190> gravity<00:07:25.580> it<00:07:25.789> is<00:07:25.819> very<00:07:26.300> important

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
center of gravity it is very important

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.509 
center of gravity it is very important
otherwise<00:07:28.310> it<00:07:28.940> will<00:07:29.090> fall<00:07:29.150> down
