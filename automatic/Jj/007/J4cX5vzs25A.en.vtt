animation all three devices going to be

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.840 
animation all three devices going to be
a<00:02:06.520> real<00:02:06.790> slow<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:07.960> let's<00:02:08.680> try<00:02:09.100> if<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.490> is<00:02:09.640> real

a real slow so let's try if this is real

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.690 
a real slow so let's try if this is real
or<00:02:10.090> fake<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:11.140> go<00:02:11.320> let's<00:02:12.010> open<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.370> mouth<00:02:12.490> I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.220 
to open the settings together three two
one

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
one

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.410 
one
so<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.650> see<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.430> ID<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.850> I'm<00:02:21.970> jailbroken

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
so as you see the ID and I'm jailbroken

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
so as you see the ID and I'm jailbroken
iPhone<00:02:22.870> 6<00:02:23.080> opens<00:02:23.590> faster<00:02:24.130> than<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
iPhone 6 opens faster than the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.940 
iPhone 6 opens faster than the
jailbroken<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.210> wanted<00:02:25.900> let's<00:02:26.440> try<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.770> again

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
jailbroken I wanted let's try it again

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.620 
jailbroken I wanted let's try it again
to<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.340> sure<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.090> real

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
to be sure that it's real

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.950 
to be sure that it's real
3<00:02:29.260> 2<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:32.350> as<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:33.010> see<00:02:33.190> again<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:34.060> iPhone<00:02:34.480> 6

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
3 2 so as you see again the iPhone 6

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.680 
3 2 so as you see again the iPhone 6
without<00:02:35.380> your<00:02:35.650> breaker<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.250> faster<00:02:37.240> than<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
without your breaker is faster than the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.430 
without your breaker is faster than the
iPhone<00:02:38.170> 6<00:02:38.770> with<00:02:38.980> jewelry<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:41.050> second

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
iPhone 6 with jewelry the second

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.910 
iPhone 6 with jewelry the second
disadvantage<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.940> charge<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:44.140> even<00:02:44.770> as

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
disadvantage is the charge so even as

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.500 
disadvantage is the charge so even as
you<00:02:45.040> see<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.460> charge<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.090> jailbroken

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you see the charge in the jailbroken

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.750 
you see the charge in the jailbroken
device<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.020> less<00:02:47.260> than<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.650> charge<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
device is less than the charge in the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.240 
device is less than the charge in the
non<00:02:48.910> jailbroken<00:02:49.330> device<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.410> charge<00:02:50.710> in<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
non jailbroken device the charge in the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.110 
non jailbroken device the charge in the
iPhone<00:02:52.090> 6<00:02:52.390> jailbroken<00:02:53.050> will<00:02:53.920> end<00:02:54.160> faster<00:02:54.910> than

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
iPhone 6 jailbroken will end faster than

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.720 
iPhone 6 jailbroken will end faster than
before<00:02:55.270> because<00:02:55.989> jailbreak<00:02:56.739> takes<00:02:57.220> like

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
before because jailbreak takes like

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.870 
before because jailbreak takes like
energy<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.050> iPhone<00:02:59.410> 6<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.580> will

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
energy of the iPhone 6 and that will

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.550 
energy of the iPhone 6 and that will
cause<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:02.290> battery<00:03:02.680> life<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.459> end<00:03:03.640> first<00:03:04.030> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
cause the battery life to end first and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.250 
cause the battery life to end first and
the<00:03:05.560> last<00:03:05.770> disadvantage<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.180> world<00:03:07.450> be

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
the last disadvantage is the world be

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
the last disadvantage is the world be
