back the paint scheme that was used back
in<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.680> 60s<00:03:31.129> because<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:31.610> what

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
in the 60s because that's what

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.089 
in the 60s because that's what
legendarily<00:03:32.420> stuck<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.140> for<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> motion<00:03:33.709> car

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099
