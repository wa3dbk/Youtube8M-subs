telling me that they were learning about

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.939 
telling me that they were learning about
temperature<00:00:17.020> and<00:00:17.460> thermometers<00:00:18.460> so<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.800> was

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
temperature and thermometers so that was

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.359 
temperature and thermometers so that was
great<00:00:21.070> he<00:00:21.910> then<00:00:22.180> asked<00:00:22.510> me<00:00:22.539> about<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:24.160> that

great he then asked me about was that

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.330 
great he then asked me about was that
the<00:00:24.490> same<00:00:24.760> thing<00:00:25.150> as<00:00:25.359> the<00:00:25.869> thermostat<00:00:26.650> in<00:00:27.130> the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
the same thing as the thermostat in the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.640 
the same thing as the thermostat in the
house<00:00:27.519> because<00:00:27.789> often<00:00:28.090> I'd<00:00:28.210> say<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.480> him<00:00:28.810> go

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
house because often I'd say to him go

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.579 
house because often I'd say to him go
and<00:00:29.769> turn<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.099> thermostat<00:00:30.310> down<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.839> was

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:32.589 
and turn the thermostat down and I was

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:33.630 
and turn the thermostat down and I was
trying<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:32.890> explain<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.220> him<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.519> difference

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
trying to explain to him the difference

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.390 
trying to explain to him the difference
between<00:00:34.239> what<00:00:35.019> a<00:00:35.050> thermometer<00:00:35.440> does<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.190> the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
between what a thermometer does and the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.829 
between what a thermometer does and the
thermostat<00:00:36.940> in<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.089> house<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.659> thought

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
thermostat in the house and I thought

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.170 
thermostat in the house and I thought
this<00:00:38.290> is<00:00:38.470> exactly<00:00:38.650> like<00:00:41.369> tennis<00:00:42.369> this<00:00:43.030> is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
this is exactly like tennis this is

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.270 
this is exactly like tennis this is
exactly<00:00:43.629> like<00:00:43.690> I<00:00:44.019> see<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.290> lot<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.739> tennis

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
exactly like I see a lot of tennis

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.930 
exactly like I see a lot of tennis
players<00:00:45.580> who<00:00:45.940> are<00:00:46.869> actually<00:00:47.229> more<00:00:47.500> like

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
players who are actually more like

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.799 
players who are actually more like
thermometers<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:48.970> not<00:00:49.390> enough<00:00:49.690> like

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
thermometers and not enough like

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.100 
thermometers and not enough like
thermostats<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:50.769> let<00:00:51.190> me<00:00:51.309> explain<00:00:51.930> too<00:00:52.930> many

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
thermostats and let me explain too many

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.740 
thermostats and let me explain too many
players<00:00:53.409> are<00:00:53.589> like<00:00:53.850> thermometers<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:55.180> as<00:00:55.479> much

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
players are like thermometers in as much

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.859 
players are like thermometers in as much
as<00:00:56.049> all<00:00:56.710> they<00:00:57.129> do<00:00:57.189> is<00:00:57.790> they<00:00:58.330> kind<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.689> give<00:00:58.839> a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
as all they do is they kind of give a

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.619 
as all they do is they kind of give a
reading<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.830> what's<00:01:00.339> going<00:01:00.610> on<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.479> they're

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
reading of what's going on so they're

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.049 
reading of what's going on so they're
playing<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:02.049> match<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.670> tell<00:01:03.909> that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
playing a match they can tell that

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.880 
playing a match they can tell that
they're<00:01:04.210> under<00:01:04.479> pressure<00:01:04.510> or<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.740> they're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
they're under pressure or that they're

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.010 
they're under pressure or that they're
winning<00:01:06.100> or<00:01:06.310> they're<00:01:06.430> losing<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.900> they

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
winning or they're losing but they

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.529 
winning or they're losing but they
actually<00:01:08.170> can't<00:01:08.679> change<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:10.090> way<00:01:10.270> they're

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
actually can't change the way they're

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.770 
actually can't change the way they're
playing<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.549> affect<00:01:13.000> what's<00:01:13.270> happening<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:13.719> if

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
playing to affect what's happening so if

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.999 
playing to affect what's happening so if
they're<00:01:13.929> winning<00:01:14.140> that's<00:01:14.409> great<00:01:14.740> if<00:01:14.859> they're

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
they're winning that's great if they're

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.429 
they're winning that's great if they're
losing<00:01:15.219> they're<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.030> trouble<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:17.079> players

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
losing they're in trouble the players

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.950 
losing they're in trouble the players
the<00:01:17.920> best<00:01:18.159> players<00:01:18.340> are<00:01:19.210> more<00:01:19.689> like

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
the best players are more like

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.700 
the best players are more like
thermostats<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.979> as<00:01:21.130> much<00:01:21.369> as<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:22.659> things<00:01:23.079> are

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
thermostats in as much as if things are

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.700 
thermostats in as much as if things are
cool<00:01:24.039> and<00:01:24.490> cold<00:01:24.759> and<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.390> they're<00:01:26.109> losing<00:01:26.320> and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
cool and cold and and they're losing and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.319 
cool and cold and and they're losing and
things<00:01:27.130> are<00:01:27.280> not<00:01:27.399> quite<00:01:27.520> happening<00:01:27.969> and

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
things are not quite happening and

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.289 
things are not quite happening and
they're<00:01:28.539> able<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:28.960> take<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.259> reading<00:01:30.299> but

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
they're able to take a reading but

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.669 
they're able to take a reading but
they're<00:01:31.420> able<00:01:31.539> to<00:01:31.719> adjust<00:01:32.170> they're<00:01:32.439> able<00:01:32.560> to

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
they're able to adjust they're able to

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.539 
they're able to adjust they're able to
turn<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.280> heat<00:01:33.490> up<00:01:33.520> in<00:01:34.060> their<00:01:34.630> own<00:01:34.659> game<00:01:35.140> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
turn the heat up in their own game to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.520 
turn the heat up in their own game to
affect<00:01:36.569> what's<00:01:37.569> happening<00:01:37.960> out<00:01:38.079> there<00:01:38.109> on<00:01:38.409> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
affect what's happening out there on the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.919 
affect what's happening out there on the
court<00:01:38.799> so<00:01:39.609> think<00:01:39.909> about<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.450> think<00:01:40.810> about

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
court so think about that think about

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.550 
court so think about that think about
how<00:01:41.289> much<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.219> are<00:01:42.719> more<00:01:43.719> like<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.899> thermostat

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
how much you are more like a thermostat

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.580 
how much you are more like a thermostat
or<00:01:45.310> are<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.880> unfortunately<00:01:46.869> more<00:01:47.350> like<00:01:47.560> a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
or are you unfortunately more like a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.499 
or are you unfortunately more like a
thermometer<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.609> if<00:01:48.880> you're<00:01:49.030> more<00:01:49.299> at<00:01:49.389> the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
thermometer and if you're more at the

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.319 
thermometer and if you're more at the
thermometer<00:01:50.229> end<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.649> things<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:52.030> about

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
thermometer end of things think about

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.899 
thermometer end of things think about
what<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.749> can<00:01:52.929> do<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.859> turn<00:01:54.130> yourself<00:01:54.579> into

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
what you can do to turn yourself into

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:04.620 
what you can do to turn yourself into
more<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:56.079> thermostat

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.689 

you
