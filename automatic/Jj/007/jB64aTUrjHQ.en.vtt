00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
making actual 3d animated flare and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.839 
making actual 3d animated flare and
blender<00:00:24.300> heck<00:00:24.779> yeah<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.699> know

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849

chitchat let's get started now we have
our<00:00:31.080> default<00:00:31.710> theme<00:00:32.149> we're<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> be

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
our default theme we're not going to be

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.889 
our default theme we're not going to be
making<00:00:34.410> anything<00:00:34.860> other<00:00:35.370> than<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> flare<00:00:36.059> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
making anything other than the flare so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.420 
making anything other than the flare so
we're<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.829> erasing<00:00:38.070> anything

we're not going to be erasing anything
so<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> hit<00:00:39.120> add<00:00:40.070> root<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.370> we're

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so we're going to hit add root so we're

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
so we're going to hit add root so we're
going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> hit<00:00:42.030> add<00:00:43.280> mesh<00:00:44.420> circle<00:00:45.739> we're<00:00:46.739> going

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
going to hit add mesh circle we're going

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
going to hit add mesh circle we're going
to<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> three<00:00:47.489> vertices<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:49.489> if<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:51.360> CH

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to go to three vertices and if your CH

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.139 
to go to three vertices and if your CH
and<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.260> vertices<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.399> hi<00:00:53.670> just

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and if your vertices are like hi just

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
and if your vertices are like hi just
move<00:00:54.780> down<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> way<00:00:56.699> to

go go here and we're going to go to
shaders<00:02:07.459> which<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.319> case<00:02:10.440> you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
shaders which is I just in case you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.400 
shaders which is I just in case you
didn't<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> shaders<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:12.239> here

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
didn't see it shaders is right here
