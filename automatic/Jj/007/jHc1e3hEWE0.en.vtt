00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
container quite a pretty effect that but

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.630 
container quite a pretty effect that but
one<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> problems<00:02:53.049> with<00:02:53.170> cacti<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:54.069> that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
one of the problems with cacti is that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.500 
one of the problems with cacti is that
they<00:02:54.819> get<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.299> pest<00:02:56.260> called<00:02:56.829> mealy<00:02:57.340> bug<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.269> if

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
they get a pest called mealy bug and if

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.990 
they get a pest called mealy bug and if
you<00:02:58.599> look<00:02:58.780> very<00:02:58.810> carefully<00:02:59.380> it<00:03:00.340> looks<00:03:00.730> like

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
you look very carefully it looks like

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.630 
you look very carefully it looks like
white<00:03:01.390> fluffy<00:03:02.319> stuff<00:03:02.709> there<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.430> look

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
white fluffy stuff there and if you look

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.839 
white fluffy stuff there and if you look
closely<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.840> all<00:03:08.200> over<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.860> plant<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
closely it's all over this plant and

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.819 
closely it's all over this plant and
that's<00:03:10.060> very<00:03:10.390> characteristic<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:11.260> mealy<00:03:11.530> bug

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
that's very characteristic of mealy bug

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.460 
that's very characteristic of mealy bug
that<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.129> gets<00:03:12.450> into<00:03:13.450> little<00:03:14.019> cracks<00:03:14.290> and

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that it gets into little cracks and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.619 
that it gets into little cracks and
crevices<00:03:14.560> where<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.280> leaf<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.910> attached<00:03:16.450> to

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
crevices where the leaf is attached to

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.900 
crevices where the leaf is attached to
the<00:03:16.750> stem<00:03:17.019> here's<00:03:17.590> some<00:03:17.860> more<00:03:18.069> down<00:03:18.310> here<00:03:18.370> and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
the stem here's some more down here and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.130 
the stem here's some more down here and
here<00:03:20.129> it's<00:03:21.129> all<00:03:21.280> over<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.760> plant<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.959> we

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
here it's all over this plant and so we

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.670 
here it's all over this plant and so we
need<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.500> spray<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.129> with<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> proprietary

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
need to spray that with a proprietary

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.590 
need to spray that with a proprietary
insecticide<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.950> here<00:03:27.609> I've<00:03:27.760> got<00:03:28.000> an<00:03:28.180> organic

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
insecticide and here I've got an organic

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.650 
insecticide and here I've got an organic
insecticide<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.819> that's<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.150> going<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.450> harm

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
insecticide so that's not going to harm

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.020 
insecticide so that's not going to harm
the<00:03:32.079> environment<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.370> need<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.819> really

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
the environment but I need to really

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.349 
the environment but I need to really
spray<00:03:34.780> thickly<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.859> get<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.609> mealy<00:03:37.120> bug

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
spray thickly to get the mealy bug

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:47.199 
spray thickly to get the mealy bug
completely<00:03:37.900> covered

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.120 

and<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.360> need<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.750> spray<00:03:48.990> all<00:03:49.230> parts<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
and you need to spray all parts of the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:04.509 
and you need to spray all parts of the
plant

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.970 

good<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.120> know<00:04:06.359> that<00:04:06.870> plants<00:04:07.290> best<00:04:07.530> left<00:04:07.829> in

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
good and know that plants best left in

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.970 
good and know that plants best left in
the<00:04:08.099> shade<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.760> for<00:04:08.999> a<00:04:09.599> day<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.530> load<00:04:10.799> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
the shade just for a day to load it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.839 
the shade just for a day to load it
insecticide<00:04:11.909> to<00:04:12.090> dry<00:04:12.359> on<00:04:12.569> on<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.109> leaves

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
insecticide to dry on on the leaves

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.279 
insecticide to dry on on the leaves
you'll<00:04:14.849> need<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.239> keep<00:04:15.420> checking<00:04:15.480> out<00:04:16.049> for

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
you'll need to keep checking out for

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.080 
you'll need to keep checking out for
mealy<00:04:16.560> bug<00:04:16.739> as<00:04:16.889> well<00:04:17.070> because<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.729> all

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
mealy bug as well because it in all

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.569 
mealy bug as well because it in all
likelihood<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.900> will<00:04:18.930> reappear<00:04:19.470> as<00:04:20.340> well

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
likelihood it will reappear as well

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.850 
likelihood it will reappear as well
because<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.389> insecticide<00:04:22.199> won't<00:04:22.500> kill<00:04:22.740> off

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
because the insecticide won't kill off

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.400 
because the insecticide won't kill off
the<00:04:23.039> egg<00:04:23.190> stages<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.810> you'll<00:04:24.990> need<00:04:25.229> to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
the egg stages and so you'll need to

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.870 
the egg stages and so you'll need to
keep<00:04:25.620> retreating<00:04:26.220> it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
keep retreating it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.560 
keep retreating it
cacti<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.139> hot<00:04:28.740> sunny<00:04:29.190> positions<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.330> this

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
cacti like hot sunny positions so this

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.110 
cacti like hot sunny positions so this
rather<00:04:31.380> attractive<00:04:32.009> group<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.400> cacti<00:04:32.849> here

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
rather attractive group of cacti here

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.779 
rather attractive group of cacti here
needs<00:04:33.780> normally<00:04:34.259> to<00:04:34.410> live<00:04:34.650> in<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:35.520> south-facing

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
needs normally to live in a south-facing

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.010 
needs normally to live in a south-facing
window<00:04:36.750> or<00:04:36.900> any<00:04:37.190> sunny<00:04:38.190> window<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.750> that's

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
window or any sunny window and that's

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.009 
window or any sunny window and that's
how<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.320> grow<00:04:40.530> cacti
