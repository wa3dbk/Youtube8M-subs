00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.370 
combine them seamlessly and they had
just<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:09.399> humongous<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:11.300> chain<00:02:12.080> of

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
just this humongous just chain of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.809 
just this humongous just chain of
islands<00:02:13.150> built<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.840> canvas<00:02:15.140> using<00:02:16.069> you

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
islands built on this canvas using you

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.460 
islands built on this canvas using you
know<00:02:16.940> most<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> objects<00:02:17.810> with<00:02:18.019> us<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.319> not

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
know most of the objects with us but not

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.420 
know most of the objects with us but not
even<00:02:18.769> all<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.099> them<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:20.420> any<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.650> didn't<00:02:22.160> look

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
even all of them just any it didn't look

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.309 
even all of them just any it didn't look
like<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.819> was<00:02:22.970> built<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.510> forge<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.050> looked

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
like it was built in forge it looked

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.360 
like it was built in forge it looked
like<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.989> looked<00:02:27.230> incredible<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:27.980> they

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
like how it looked incredible and they

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.759 
like how it looked incredible and they
built<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.849> beaver<00:02:29.390> creek<00:02:29.810> remake<00:02:30.260> here<00:02:30.620> and

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
built a beaver creek remake here and

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.920 
built a beaver creek remake here and
they<00:02:31.190> had<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:32.090> know<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.540> terrain<00:02:32.810> was

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
they had just you know the terrain was

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.009 
they had just you know the terrain was
huge<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.860> there's<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.099> million<00:02:34.459> different

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
huge and there's a million different

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.300 
huge and there's a million different
types<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.140> trees<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.530> different<00:02:36.890> terrain

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
types of trees and different terrain

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.750 
types of trees and different terrain
options<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.200> insane<00:02:39.830> so

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
options and it's just insane so

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.460 
options and it's just insane so
basically<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.390> bottom<00:02:41.720> line<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:41.959> all<00:02:42.319> this

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
basically the bottom line on all this

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.890 
basically the bottom line on all this
terrain<00:02:42.830> stuff<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.540> can<00:02:44.720> build

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
terrain stuff is that you can build

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.600 
terrain stuff is that you can build
pretty<00:02:45.410> much<00:02:45.590> whatever<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.069> hell<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.370> want

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
pretty much whatever the hell you want

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.530 
pretty much whatever the hell you want
which<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.440> amazing<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:48.830> anything<00:02:49.610> honest<00:02:50.299> I

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
which is amazing so anything honest I

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.870 
which is amazing so anything honest I
mean<00:02:50.720> obviously<00:02:51.319> there<00:02:51.920> are<00:02:51.950> limitations<00:02:52.400> but

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
mean obviously there are limitations but

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.699 
mean obviously there are limitations but
so<00:02:53.420> that's<00:02:53.599> incredible<00:02:54.079> but<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> other

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
so that's incredible but then the other

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.740 
so that's incredible but then the other
thing<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.670> know<00:02:55.880> as<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.360> wasn't<00:02:56.569> enough

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
thing you know as if that wasn't enough

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.990 
thing you know as if that wasn't enough
was<00:02:57.680> we<00:02:57.950> heard<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.310> they<00:02:58.430> were<00:02:58.489> going<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.880> be

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
was we heard that they were going to be

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.809 
was we heard that they were going to be
some<00:02:59.450> scripting<00:03:00.170> features<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.340> they<00:03:01.489> actually

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
some scripting features so they actually

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.910 
some scripting features so they actually
demonstrated<00:03:02.480> some<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.780> those<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.620> looks

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
demonstrated some of those and it looks

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.710 
demonstrated some of those and it looks
like<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.519> pretty<00:03:04.700> much<00:03:04.790> pull<00:03:05.180> any<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
like you can pretty much pull any of the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.660 
like you can pretty much pull any of the
dynamic<00:03:06.260> map<00:03:06.500> elements<00:03:06.709> from<00:03:07.010> any<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.459> six

dynamic map elements from any of the six

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.890 
dynamic map elements from any of the six
remastered<00:03:08.000> maps<00:03:08.359> to<00:03:08.569> like<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.260> EMPs<00:03:10.160> on

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900

remastered maps to like the EMPs on
bloodline<00:03:11.900> or<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.890> know<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.130> co<00:03:13.250> Agri<00:03:13.579> make

demonstrated a couple different things

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
you can open and close the gates you can

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.300 
you can open and close the gates you can
activate<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.109> EMP<00:03:39.680> they<00:03:39.920> did<00:03:40.069> something

activate the EMP they did something

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.069 
activate the EMP they did something
where<00:03:40.549> they<00:03:40.639> just<00:03:40.670> blew<00:03:41.150> up<00:03:41.329> all<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.630> vehicles

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
where they just blew up all the vehicles

where they just blew up all the vehicles
within<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.500> certain<00:03:42.709> radius<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:44.000> know<00:03:44.090> just

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
within a certain radius you know just

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.539 
within a certain radius you know just
all<00:03:44.840> kinds<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.500> crazy<00:03:45.680> stuff<00:03:45.889> like<00:03:46.100> that<00:03:46.310> you

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
all kinds of crazy stuff like that you

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.180 
all kinds of crazy stuff like that you
can<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.880> like<00:03:47.630> anything<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.620> possibilities

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
can do like anything the possibilities

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.490 
can do like anything the possibilities
are<00:03:49.220> endless<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:50.660> know<00:03:50.750> now<00:03:50.930> hopefully

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
are endless you know now hopefully

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.099 
are endless you know now hopefully
people<00:03:52.280> won't<00:03:52.970> go<00:03:53.150> too<00:03:53.209> crazy<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:53.750> some<00:03:53.989> of

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
people won't go too crazy with some of

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.900 
people won't go too crazy with some of
this<00:03:54.170> stuff<00:03:54.380> like<00:03:54.590> doing<00:03:55.069> gimmicky<00:03:55.459> stuff<00:03:55.700> but

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
this stuff like doing gimmicky stuff but

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.210 
this stuff like doing gimmicky stuff but
i<00:03:55.940> think<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:57.109> possibilities<00:03:57.739> both<00:03:57.980> in

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
i think that the possibilities both in

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.000 
i think that the possibilities both in
terms<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.910> just<00:03:59.650> integrating<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:00.739> sort<00:04:00.980> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
terms of just integrating this sort of
