00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.069
 in the face of the headlines, it's hard to breathe 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.410
 he is 15 percent for the FDP in the federal election then the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 Nobel Peace Prize for Barack Obama and now I have my day coalition in the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.319
 Saarland 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.769
 We experience global warming from a global drunkenness in the world 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.230
 Shadow is made 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.100
 Is there any new drug that has not offered me again? 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.409
 Take the FDP, which has only years to complain about the state should 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.140
 to keep out of everything the free market can do everything better 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.950
 than then the free financial and economic market thanks to the 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 obvious competence freedom of all involved last year in itself 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.060
 collapsed 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.430
 has the FDP in the Bundestag and in the Bundesrat without grumbling on the pump 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.020
 paid several hundred billion euro rescue package agreed 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 where their business friends have been in the financial industry since the shop 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.280
 And now the FDP is in the coalition negotiations and scolds 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.840
 about the high national debt 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.970
 which she herself has decided on with the neoliberal economic concept without 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.590
 State aid would have failed completely 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.350
 whoever is low enough to support such a party he lends 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.660
 Of course, President Obama also won the Nobel Peace Prize 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 who could have put him in Oslo could have him with one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.990
 Preempt beatification 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.130
 Obama himself does not consider himself worthy of a line with such 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.650
 Honorable men like Henry Kissinger Yasser Arafat and in the end we have him 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:27.980
 to be asked 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.660
 What has Obama done? 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.240
 After all, Arafat and B have a lot to offer as successful terrorists 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.780
 innocent civilians on the conscience 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 Kissinger has organized the coup in Chile in the media liked on 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 Secret Service chief of all those who gave the order 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.270
 Barack Obama can only understand the price as an incentive for future actions 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.740
 he is going to earth because he is entering a nuclear weapon-free world 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.659
 Therefore, he wants to first umbedingt prevent that Iran in the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.400
 Possession of nuclear weapons 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 if necessary, with a military strike, he said 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.140
 That would be a nice opportunity if he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on the day 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.240
 Award his combat bombers to the Iranian uranium enrichment facility 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.589
 small fireworks could be organized 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.929
 the Greens would always blame it for a nuclear-weapon-free one 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.179
 World were 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.199
 they are now fighting for a left the free world 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.579
 instead of creating peace without weapons, it now means social justice 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.039
 create with the FDP 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.549
 life has to be beautiful once you have the grip of the mind 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.429
 thrown off
