taking<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> drastic<00:00:55.289> jump<00:00:55.820> with<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:57.059> we've

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
taking the drastic jump with how we've

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
taking the drastic jump with how we've
been<00:00:57.270> able<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.840> guard<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.770> great<00:00:59.340> tiling

been able to guard you know great tiling

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720 
been able to guard you know great tiling
the<00:00:59.850> league<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.039> plan<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> road<00:01:02.460> that's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the league and plan on the road that's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.039 
the league and plan on the road that's
the<00:01:02.879> only<00:01:03.120> way<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:03.960> going

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the only way you know that you're going

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.020 
the only way you know that you're going
to<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.199> wins<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.710> making<00:01:05.369> sure<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.610> defense

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to get wins is making sure your defense

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
to get wins is making sure your defense
travels<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.750> never<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.990> how

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
travels because you never know how

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.000 
travels because you never know how
you're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> shoot<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> particular

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you're going to shoot on a particular

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.399 
you're going to shoot on a particular
night<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.110> most<00:01:10.260> part

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
night so I think for the most part

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
night so I think for the most part
that's<00:01:10.680> been<00:01:10.830> our<00:01:10.979> calling<00:01:11.610> card<00:01:11.640> as

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that's been our calling card as

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.719 
that's been our calling card as
defensive<00:01:12.479> rebounding<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.080> we've<00:01:14.070> made<00:01:14.580> some

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
defensive rebounding and we've made some

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
defensive rebounding and we've made some
drastic<00:01:14.939> improvements<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.750> those<00:01:15.869> areas<00:01:16.229> all

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
drastic improvements in those areas all

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.749 
drastic improvements in those areas all
right<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
right so it's good right now but it's

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.890 
right so it's good right now but it's
been<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> challenge<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> first<00:01:18.540> couple<00:01:18.780> of
