00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
I'm battery 3 loaded up here and i have

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
I'm battery 3 loaded up here and i have
this<00:00:20.310> soul<00:00:20.580> kit<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.119> i<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:21.930> very

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
this soul kit and i think it's very

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
this soul kit and i think it's very
realistic<00:00:22.529> sounding<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.580> really

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
realistic sounding i think it's really

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.490 
realistic sounding i think it's really
good<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.590> what<00:00:25.590> I've<00:00:25.680> basically<00:00:25.920> done<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
good and what I've basically done is

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.279 
good and what I've basically done is
utilize<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.859> routing<00:00:29.570> possibilities<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
utilize the routing possibilities to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
utilize the routing possibilities to
kind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.650> recreate<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> real

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

and<00:00:53.129> you'll<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> sounds<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:55.620> know

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
and you'll know the sounds and you know

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
and you'll know the sounds and you know
how<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.430> lay<00:00:56.640> down<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:57.030> processing<00:00:57.690> on

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
how you can lay down your processing on

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.720 
how you can lay down your processing on
all<00:00:58.020> these<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.739> separate<00:00:59.190> tracks<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
all these you know separate tracks that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.360 
all these you know separate tracks that
you<00:00:59.789> got<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.449> they're<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.690> spread<00:01:00.989> out

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
you got now that they're all spread out

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
you got now that they're all spread out
so<00:01:02.370> basically<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> did<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.809> took

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so basically what I did is you know took

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
so basically what I did is you know took
advantage<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> routing<00:01:05.400> possibilities

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
advantage of the routing possibilities

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
advantage of the routing possibilities
like<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.540> said<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> took<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> direct

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
like I said so I took all the direct

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
like I said so I took all the direct
sounds<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.540> direct<00:01:09.930> kick<00:01:10.260> direct

and<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:11.390> room<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.900> model<00:02:12.890> 12<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.430> i<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and the room is model 12 and i have the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.020 
and the room is model 12 and i have the
overheads<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.860> stereo<00:02:16.160> three<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.790> four

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
overheads on the stereo three and four

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.510 
overheads on the stereo three and four
so<00:02:17.690> I've<00:02:17.990> recreated<00:02:18.440> all<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.250> inside

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
so I've recreated all of that inside

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.699 
so I've recreated all of that inside
battery<00:02:20.180> with<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.510> routing<00:02:21.020> possibilities

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
battery with the routing possibilities

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.449 
battery with the routing possibilities
as<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.160> see<00:02:22.340> kick<00:02:22.970> overhead<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:24.459> channel

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
as you can see kick overhead is channel

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.580 
as you can see kick overhead is channel
three<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.790> four<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.810> did<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.110> snare

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
three and four and then I did the snare

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.270 
three and four and then I did the snare
here<00:02:28.340> as<00:02:29.050> channel<00:02:30.050> three<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.380> four<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:31.130> I

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
here as channel three and four then I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.510 
here as channel three and four then I
did<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.550> ride<00:02:31.880> bell<00:02:32.480> also<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.950> channel<00:02:34.370> three

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
did the ride bell also to channel three

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.340 
did the ride bell also to channel three
and<00:02:34.670> four<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.270> know<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.450> get<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> idea<00:02:35.840> it's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
and four you know you get the idea it's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.800 
and four you know you get the idea it's
kind<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.860> repetitive<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.670> takes<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.630> little

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
kind of repetitive and takes a little

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.440 
kind of repetitive and takes a little
bit<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.080> time<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:39.550> can<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.209> really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
bit of time but can you can really

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.110 
bit of time but can you can really
benefit<00:02:41.930> from<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.610> okay<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:43.670> now<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
benefit from this okay so now that I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.510 
benefit from this okay so now that I
have<00:02:44.180> everything<00:02:44.750> laid<00:02:44.959> out<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.340> all

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
have everything laid out there with all

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.729 
have everything laid out there with all
my<00:02:46.700> routing<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.930> record<00:02:48.080> these<00:02:48.470> as

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
my routing I'm going to record these as

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.630 
my routing I'm going to record these as
audio<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.840> um<00:02:51.110> all<00:02:51.440> those<00:02:51.650> tracks<00:02:52.010> for<00:02:52.220> record

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
audio so um all those tracks for record

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:22.870 
audio so um all those tracks for record
and<00:02:53.230> I'm<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> record<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:22.549> don't<00:03:22.730> want

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
and I'm going to record you don't want

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.180 
and I'm going to record you don't want
to<00:03:23.000> stop<00:03:23.209> recording<00:03:23.390> too<00:03:23.840> early<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.440> cut<00:03:25.070> off

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
to stop recording too early and cut off

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.370 
to stop recording too early and cut off
data<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:26.030> know<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.329> crash<00:03:28.720> alright<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.049> now

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
data you know the crash alright so now

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.759 
data you know the crash alright so now
that<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.620> did<00:03:30.920> that<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.750> can<00:03:32.900> see<00:03:33.170> now<00:03:33.470> just

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
that I did that you can see now just

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:41.460 
that I did that you can see now just
play<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.250> overheads

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.920 

now<00:03:42.470> just<00:03:42.740> play<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.040> room<00:03:49.690> sounds<00:03:50.690> very

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
now just play the room sounds very

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.130 
now just play the room sounds very
realistic<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:53.210> kick<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:54.770> direct<00:03:55.160> kick

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
realistic is the kick the direct kick

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:15.310 
realistic is the kick the direct kick
direct<00:03:57.140> snare<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:02.000> ride<00:04:04.420> slow<00:04:05.420> crash<00:04:14.320> you

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
direct snare is the ride slow crash you

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.170 
direct snare is the ride slow crash you
know<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.470> get<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:15.890> idea<00:04:15.950> not<00:04:16.579> like<00:04:16.910> now<00:04:17.120> you

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
know you get the idea not like now you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.949 
know you get the idea not like now you
can<00:04:17.510> see<00:04:17.780> how<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:19.190> know<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.489> real<00:04:19.790> drum<00:04:20.120> set<00:04:20.720> is

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
can see how you know a real drum set is

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.110 
can see how you know a real drum set is
you<00:04:21.380> know<00:04:21.470> laid<00:04:21.739> out<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.040> tracks<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:22.940> things

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
you know laid out on tracks and things

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.790 
you know laid out on tracks and things
like<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.510> now<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:23.960> can<00:04:24.200> do<00:04:24.350> all<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.590> your

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
like that and now you can do all of your

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.980 
like that and now you can do all of your
processing<00:04:25.490> on<00:04:25.669> all<00:04:25.940> those<00:04:26.120> separate<00:04:26.630> parts

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
processing on all those separate parts

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.840 
processing on all those separate parts
it's<00:04:27.200> really<00:04:27.500> cool<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.950> know<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.580> could<00:04:28.820> play

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
it's really cool you know you could play

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.640 
it's really cool you know you could play
around<00:04:29.210> with<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.540> panning<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.320> all<00:04:30.470> that

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
around with the panning and all that

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.740 
around with the panning and all that
stuff<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.550> know<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.730> can<00:04:32.090> do<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.480> within

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
stuff you know you can do this within

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.620 
stuff you know you can do this within
battery<00:04:33.350> itself<00:04:33.800> but<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.520> feel<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.240> when<00:04:35.600> you

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
battery itself but I feel like when you

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.830 
battery itself but I feel like when you
do<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.169> these<00:04:36.370> audio<00:04:37.370> tracks<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:38.660> have<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
do it on these audio tracks you have a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.540 
do it on these audio tracks you have a
lot<00:04:39.110> more<00:04:39.290> possibilities<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.370> know<00:04:40.490> you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
lot more possibilities you know you

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.640 
lot more possibilities you know you
could<00:04:40.790> have<00:04:40.840> different<00:04:41.840> kinds<00:04:42.140> of<00:04:42.200> reverb

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
could have different kinds of reverb

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.590 
could have different kinds of reverb
going<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.280> different<00:04:43.640> pieces<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.330> drum

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
going to different pieces of the drum

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.810 
going to different pieces of the drum
set<00:04:44.870> differently<00:04:45.320> cues<00:04:45.680> compression<00:04:46.550> all

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
set differently cues compression all

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.540 
set differently cues compression all
that<00:04:47.000> stuff<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:48.020> know<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.560> really<00:04:48.800> cool<00:04:49.160> and

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
that stuff you know it's really cool and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.719 
that stuff you know it's really cool and
I<00:04:49.880> really<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:50.860> practicing<00:04:51.860> with<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.490> when

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
I really like practicing with this when

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.340 
I really like practicing with this when
I'm<00:04:52.850> not<00:04:53.030> able<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.479> get<00:04:53.660> in<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.810> studio<00:04:54.020> and

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
I'm not able to get in the studio and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.170 
I'm not able to get in the studio and
record<00:04:54.710> an<00:04:54.800> actual<00:04:55.070> drum<00:04:55.340> set<00:04:55.580> this<00:04:55.760> is<00:04:55.970> really

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
record an actual drum set this is really

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.000 
record an actual drum set this is really
cool<00:04:56.419> because<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:56.870> sounds<00:04:57.229> great<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.710> it's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
cool because it sounds great and it's

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.130 
cool because it sounds great and it's
very<00:04:58.070> realistic<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.600> could<00:04:59.810> get<00:04:59.930> some

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
very realistic and you could get some

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.770 
very realistic and you could get some
really<00:05:00.440> solid<00:05:00.770> mixes<00:05:01.490> down<00:05:01.729> with<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.120> you

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
really solid mixes down with this you

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.090
