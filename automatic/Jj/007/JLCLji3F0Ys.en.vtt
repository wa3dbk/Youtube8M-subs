00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 I came from the news more mass and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.480
 electrifying of your life that you with 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.330
 sure you will not regret having 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.759
 this video plays she 'll talk about 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 an interview that the producers of the game 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.140
 from the club andrÃ© in the mouth if that game 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.420
 unhappy and very pink and very with them 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.490
 he gave an interview talking a little 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.590
 about how they made the art of the game 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 that they did everything in clay is 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.680
 inspired and such 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.199
 they said that in fact the idea 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 was not to do everything well but if 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.750
 they did because it passed but the idea 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.270
 the character they wanted to express 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 a little bit like that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.309
 the animations that people watch 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 ivory stop-motion knows type d-box 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 sections that they recently left 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.789
 more or less inspired this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.250
 only different from the other game that is the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 carb is that which they did all over 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.149
 fabric and if they make fabric 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 they really did it all in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.280
 fabric and then made a game of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 they made and only dissolved 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 for even inspired they got so 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 I saw how he worked with her and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
 made a game was just to make the art 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.130
 the game only they ended up liking the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.110
 idea that it is malleable and that kind of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.780
 thing and they decided to change the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 gameplay only because of it 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 so they made the club power 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 transform or else a submarine 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.860
 some things like that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.659
 during the game then that in case he 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 producers thought it was leaving the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.030
 More fun interactive game is a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 if a little difficult to happen 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.200
 because usually the person already has idea 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.140
 ready game type gameplay 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 how is the game going to work before 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.759
 they make art after they do 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 art by row so it 's different you see 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.210
 something that kind of like art game 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 change how it will be the gameplay 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.040
 this sort of thing is a little 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.250
 different for those who like it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.340
 It's a curiosity, but that's it. 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.789
 same 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.789
