00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
Windows or from Windows to your Mac it

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.990 
Windows or from Windows to your Mac it
doesn't<00:03:19.860> really<00:03:19.950> matter<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.340> work<00:03:20.519> both<00:03:20.700> ways

doesn't really matter it work both ways
so<00:03:21.600> uh<00:03:21.630> parallels<00:03:22.380> has<00:03:22.560> done<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> really<00:03:22.890> really

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
so uh parallels has done a really really

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.210 
so uh parallels has done a really really
good<00:03:23.280> job<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.610> integrating<00:03:24.180> both<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.989> those<00:03:25.220> so

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
good job in integrating both of those so

Windows machine which is really cool you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.310 
Windows machine which is really cool you

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
of course so that's all really really

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.550 
of course so that's all really really
nice<00:04:53.969> stuff<00:04:54.180> that's<00:04:55.050> pretty<00:04:55.259> much<00:04:55.349> how<00:04:55.530> you

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
nice stuff that's pretty much how you

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.920 
nice stuff that's pretty much how you
enable<00:04:56.340> sharing<00:04:56.610> between<00:04:56.909> parallels<00:04:57.599> on<00:04:57.780> your

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
enable sharing between parallels on your

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.990 
enable sharing between parallels on your
Mac<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.919> course<00:04:58.979> this<00:04:59.279> is<00:04:59.430> for<00:04:59.610> parallels

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
Mac of course this is for parallels

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.570 
Mac of course this is for parallels
desktop<00:05:00.360> 7<00:05:01.229> not<00:05:01.590> also<00:05:01.800> works<00:05:02.099> for<00:05:02.250> previous

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
desktop 7 not also works for previous

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.610 
desktop 7 not also works for previous
versions<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:03.180> works<00:05:03.539> up<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.779> parallels

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
versions it works up to parallels

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.890 
versions it works up to parallels
desktop<00:05:05.250> 5<00:05:05.490> already<00:05:05.819> had<00:05:06.000> had<00:05:06.389> this<00:05:06.539> I<00:05:06.689> think

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
desktop 5 already had had this I think

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.019 
desktop 5 already had had this I think
so

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
so

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.159 
so
it<00:05:09.029> works<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.419> tons<00:05:09.629> of<00:05:09.719> version<00:05:10.050> and

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
it works with tons of version and

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.719 
it works with tons of version and
probably<00:05:10.469> also<00:05:10.770> with<00:05:10.979> future<00:05:11.310> versions

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
probably also with future versions

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.999 
probably also with future versions
versions<00:05:12.689> it<00:05:12.900> will<00:05:13.020> probably<00:05:13.229> be<00:05:13.500> very<00:05:13.710> very

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
versions it will probably be very very

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.559 
versions it will probably be very very
similar<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.550> install<00:05:14.849> so<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.029> think<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.330> lot<00:05:15.449> for

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
similar to install so I think a lot for

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.480 
similar to install so I think a lot for
watching<00:05:15.840> hope<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.110> helps<00:05:16.439> if<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:17.250> have<00:05:17.370> any
