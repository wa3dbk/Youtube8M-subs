00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.110 
those two maps really where on Treyarch
I<00:04:02.690> mean<00:04:03.380> on<00:04:03.500> black<00:04:03.770> ops<00:04:04.040> there<00:04:04.310> was<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.460> you<00:04:05.000> know

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
I mean on black ops there was a you know

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.060 
I mean on black ops there was a you know
at<00:04:05.240> least<00:04:05.420> five<00:04:05.690> or<00:04:05.720> six<00:04:06.170> awesome<00:04:06.440> maps<00:04:06.860> in

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
at least five or six awesome maps in

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.060 
at least five or six awesome maps in
each<00:04:07.220> game<00:04:07.460> so<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.210> think<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:08.990> Treyarch

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
each game so I think if Treyarch

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.300 
each game so I think if Treyarch
makes<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:10.820> next<00:04:11.240> Call<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.750> Duty<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.920> would

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
makes the next Call of Duty that would

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.720 
makes the next Call of Duty that would
be<00:04:13.510> absolutely<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.870> best<00:04:15.230> thing<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:16.040> could

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
be absolutely the best thing that could

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.760 
be absolutely the best thing that could
happen<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.450> far<00:04:17.810> as<00:04:17.870> spawn<00:04:18.230> chakra<00:04:18.650> is

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
happen as far as spawn chakra is

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.800 
happen as far as spawn chakra is
concerned

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
concerned

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.760 
concerned
hopefully<00:04:20.810> they<00:04:20.960> bring<00:04:21.140> back<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.530> tech

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
hopefully they bring back the tech

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.070 
hopefully they bring back the tech
insert<00:04:22.130> hopefully<00:04:22.730> demolition<00:04:23.510> bring<00:04:23.750> makes

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
insert hopefully demolition bring makes

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.200 
insert hopefully demolition bring makes
a<00:04:24.200> comeback<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.920> hopefully<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:26.150> know

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
a comeback and hopefully you know

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.690 
a comeback and hopefully you know
there's<00:04:26.480> some<00:04:26.720> kind<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.140> spawn<00:04:27.440> system<00:04:27.980> some

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
there's some kind of spawn system some

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.120 
there's some kind of spawn system some
kind<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:28.970> Treyarch<00:04:29.570> spawn<00:04:29.840> system<00:04:30.320> where<00:04:30.680> we

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
kind of Treyarch spawn system where we

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.340 
kind of Treyarch spawn system where we
could<00:04:31.310> break<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.760> maps<00:04:32.000> all<00:04:32.360> over<00:04:32.780> again

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
could break the maps all over again

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.710 
could break the maps all over again
that's<00:04:34.190> absolutely<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.970> funnest<00:04:35.360> thing<00:04:35.570> ever

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
that's absolutely the funnest thing ever

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.040 
that's absolutely the funnest thing ever
