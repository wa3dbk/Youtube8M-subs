Yosef<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.810> see<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.140> made<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
Yosef and as you can see I have made a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.700 
Yosef and as you can see I have made a
lot<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> progress<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.550> side<00:00:23.789> i<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.930> made

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
lot of progress with my side i have made

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.279 
lot of progress with my side i have made
buttons<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.430> create<00:00:27.000> letters<00:00:27.359> instead<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
buttons that create letters instead of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.179 
buttons that create letters instead of
just<00:00:28.500> lines<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.460> stuff<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:32.009> see

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
just lines and stuff so as you can see

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
just lines and stuff so as you can see
here<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.489> testing<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> letter<00:00:33.420> T<00:00:33.719> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
here on testing it with a letter T it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.490 
here on testing it with a letter T it
can<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.160> 22<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> 26<00:00:36.989> letters<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
can make 22 of the 26 letters of the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
can make 22 of the 26 letters of the
alphabet<00:00:41.239> here<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.450> showing<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.930> how

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
alphabet here I'm just showing you how

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.209 
alphabet here I'm just showing you how
massive<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> sign<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:45.120> took<00:00:45.600> about

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
massive the sign is it took about

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.670 
massive the sign is it took about
fifteen<00:00:47.219> thousand<00:00:47.850> dirt<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.960> few<00:00:49.170> thousand

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
fifteen thousand dirt and a few thousand

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.709 
fifteen thousand dirt and a few thousand
repeaters<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.160> red<00:00:50.460> stone<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> tried<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
repeaters in red stone I tried to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
repeaters in red stone I tried to
compact<00:00:52.079> everything<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.710> best<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.129> could<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
compact everything as best as I could I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.600 
compact everything as best as I could I
went<00:00:54.090> underground<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.500> ran<00:00:56.370> out

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
went underground and I actually ran out

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.340 
went underground and I actually ran out
of<00:00:56.640> space<00:00:56.910> underground<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.260> were

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
of space underground because there were

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
of space underground because there were
so<00:00:58.379> many<00:00:58.710> circuits<00:00:59.489> underground<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> had

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so many circuits underground but I had

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.709 
so many circuits underground but I had
to<00:01:00.629> make<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.109> above-ground<00:01:01.680> ones<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.719> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to make some above-ground ones as you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
to make some above-ground ones as you
can<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> clearly<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.280> my

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
can see here I clearly don't know my

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
can see here I clearly don't know my
ABC's<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.600> missing<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.020> few<00:01:07.170> letters

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
ABC's because I'm missing a few letters

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
ABC's because I'm missing a few letters
that<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> sign<00:01:09.119> isn't<00:01:09.540> big

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that is because the sign isn't big

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.600 
that is because the sign isn't big
enough<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.830> pixels<00:01:11.250> like

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
enough to have all of those pixels like

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.300 
enough to have all of those pixels like
the<00:01:11.760> difference<00:01:11.939> between<00:01:12.150> R<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.650> about

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the difference between R and a is about

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.450 
the difference between R and a is about
one<00:01:14.670> pixel<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.710> need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
one pixel so I would need to have like a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.600 
one pixel so I would need to have like a
hundred<00:01:17.820> pixel<00:01:18.390> sign<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> 175<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
hundred pixel sign but this 175 and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.130 
hundred pixel sign but this 175 and
prepare<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.909> awesomeness<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.840> these

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
prepare for awesomeness all these

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
prepare for awesomeness all these
repeaters<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.250> part<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.060> circuit

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
repeaters here are part of one circuit

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.789 
repeaters here are part of one circuit
that<00:01:28.229> spells<00:01:28.939> minecraft<00:01:30.320> it's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.680> bit

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that spells minecraft it's a little bit

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
that spells minecraft it's a little bit
glitchy<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.659> works<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.600> circuit

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
glitchy but it works this one circuit

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.679 
glitchy but it works this one circuit
sets<00:01:37.740> off<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.220> bunch<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.790> repeaters<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.479> set

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
sets off a bunch of repeaters that set

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
sets off a bunch of repeaters that set
off<00:01:39.720> another<00:01:40.140> bunch<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.860> circuits<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.310> set

off another bunch of circuits that set

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
off another bunch of circuits that set
up<00:01:41.640> another<00:01:41.880> bunch<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> repeaters<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.020> set

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
up another bunch of repeaters that set

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.719 
up another bunch of repeaters that set
off<00:01:43.290> another<00:01:43.500> circuit<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.189> sets<00:01:44.430> off<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
off another circuit that sets off of

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.300 
off another circuit that sets off of
another<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> idea<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.040> has

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
another but you get the idea so it has

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
another but you get the idea so it has
to<00:01:47.340> light<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.850> tons<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.270> repeaters<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.780> once

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
to light up tons of repeaters at once

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
to light up tons of repeaters at once
and<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> game<00:01:49.530> can't<00:01:49.829> handle<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> lags

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and the game can't handle it so it lags

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.600 
and the game can't handle it so it lags
and<00:01:51.329> glitches<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.470> stuff<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and glitches and stuff like that so you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.780 
and glitches and stuff like that so you
can<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> sign<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.930> glitching<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.640> r

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
can see the sign is glitching out the r

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
can see the sign is glitching out the r
and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> AR<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> same<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.799> i

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and the AR the same that's because i

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.620 
and the AR the same that's because i
mentioned<00:01:59.640> before<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.060> sign<00:02:00.210> doesn't<00:02:00.420> have

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
mentioned before the sign doesn't have

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.209 
mentioned before the sign doesn't have
enough<00:02:00.840> pixels<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.439> distinguish<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.040> offer

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
enough pixels to distinguish an offer

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:13.010 
enough pixels to distinguish an offer
from<00:02:02.430> an<00:02:02.579> egg<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:04.619> spells<00:02:04.979> minecraft<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
from an egg and it spells minecraft the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.900 
from an egg and it spells minecraft the
thing<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.349> like<00:02:13.530> most<00:02:13.560> about<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.310> sign<00:02:14.550> is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
thing I like most about this sign is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.790 
thing I like most about this sign is
that<00:02:15.120> I've<00:02:15.360> seen<00:02:15.599> plenty<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.110> signs<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that I've seen plenty of signs like this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.500 
that I've seen plenty of signs like this
except<00:02:17.280> they're<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> lot<00:02:17.640> smaller<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.209> they

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
except they're a lot smaller and they

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.589 
except they're a lot smaller and they
only<00:02:18.660> say<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.980> word<00:02:20.220> at<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> time<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.420> have

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
only say one word at a time and you have

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.930 
only say one word at a time and you have
to<00:02:21.810> redo<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.860> entire<00:02:23.129> thing<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.550> make<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.819> say

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
to redo the entire thing to make it say

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.850 
to redo the entire thing to make it say
a<00:02:23.970> different<00:02:24.150> word<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.290> sign<00:02:25.560> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
a different word with this sign you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.110 
a different word with this sign you
don't<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.310> change<00:02:26.520> anything<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.940> make

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
don't have to change anything to make

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
don't have to change anything to make
it's<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.420> different<00:02:27.720> words<00:02:27.900> because<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.319> can

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
it's a different words because you can

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's a different words because you can
just<00:02:28.590> hit<00:02:29.069> buttons<00:02:29.489> for<00:02:29.940> each<00:02:30.060> letter<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
just hit buttons for each letter as you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.210 
just hit buttons for each letter as you
can<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:34.050> repeaters<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:34.709> making<00:02:35.129> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
can see the repeaters are making the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.430 
can see the repeaters are making the
game<00:02:35.370> lag<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.910> much<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.330> even<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.810> tiny

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
game lag so much that even on tiny

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.280 
game lag so much that even on tiny
rendering<00:02:38.099> distance<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.849> still<00:02:39.569> can't<00:02:39.870> load

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
rendering distance it still can't load

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.280 
rendering distance it still can't load
all<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> chunks<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.870> that's<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.019> end<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
all the chunks and that's the end of the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.910 
all the chunks and that's the end of the
sign<00:02:43.530> right<00:02:43.769> there<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.959> red<00:02:46.140> stones<00:02:46.470> lagging

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
sign right there the red stones lagging

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.220 
sign right there the red stones lagging
a<00:02:47.010> lot<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.519> still<00:02:47.730> shows<00:02:47.970> em<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.780> all<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
a lot so it still shows em and I all the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.530 
a lot so it still shows em and I all the
way<00:02:49.319> across<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.680> sign<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.330> can<00:02:51.480> see

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
way across the sign and here you can see

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.600 
way across the sign and here you can see
a<00:02:51.690> bird's-eye<00:02:52.200> view<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.920> circuit<00:02:53.280> working

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
a bird's-eye view of the circuit working

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.330 
a bird's-eye view of the circuit working
all<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.720> repeaters<00:02:55.260> are<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> delay

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
all of the repeaters are for a delay

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.130 
all of the repeaters are for a delay
because<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.940> need<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> four<00:02:57.420> or<00:02:57.540> five<00:02:57.720> second

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
because you need a four or five second

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.220 
because you need a four or five second
delay<00:02:58.230> between<00:02:58.590> each<00:02:58.920> letter
