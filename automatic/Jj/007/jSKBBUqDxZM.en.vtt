00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
previous episodes but I'm really

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.880 
previous episodes but I'm really
thinking<00:03:00.720> about<00:03:00.870> getting<00:03:01.140> back<00:03:01.379> into<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890

because<00:03:07.349> like<00:03:07.590> that's<00:03:07.739> really<00:03:07.950> intriguing

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
because like that's really intriguing

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.960 
because like that's really intriguing
the<00:03:08.640> first<00:03:08.879> two<00:03:09.120> pictures<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
the first two pictures you know the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.849 
the first two pictures you know the
first<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.390> zoom<00:03:12.629> in<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.109> made<00:03:15.859> obviously

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
first to zoom in that I made obviously

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.970 
first to zoom in that I made obviously
it<00:03:17.189> you<00:03:17.640> could<00:03:17.819> easily<00:03:18.239> say<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.560> know<00:03:19.680> hey

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
it you could easily say you know hey

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.119 
it you could easily say you know hey
that's<00:03:20.310> not<00:03:20.609> hair<00:03:21.090> O'Brien<00:03:21.480> or<00:03:21.810> whatever<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
that's not hair O'Brien or whatever you

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.479 
that's not hair O'Brien or whatever you
think<00:03:23.159> it<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.859> could<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.159> be<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.340> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
think it is like it could just be like a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.479 
think it is like it could just be like a
block<00:03:26.849> or<00:03:27.090> something<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:29.220> last

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
block or something but in the last

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.179 
block or something but in the last
picture<00:03:30.090> when<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.230> zoom<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.859> see

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
picture when you zoom in you can see

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.039 
picture when you zoom in you can see
like<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.489> white<00:03:32.730> eyes<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.659> see<00:03:34.019> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
like the white eyes and you can see the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.390 
like the white eyes and you can see the
head<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.739> square<00:03:35.129> head<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.409> it's<00:03:37.409> kind<00:03:38.310> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
head the square head and it's kind of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.550 
head the square head and it's kind of
crazy<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:40.310> do<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.639> this<00:03:41.819> saved<00:03:42.120> still
