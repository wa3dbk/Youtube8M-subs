calm and I have another great toy review

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.980 
calm and I have another great toy review
for<00:00:10.000> you<00:00:10.120> this<00:00:10.780> time<00:00:10.840> it<00:00:11.590> is<00:00:11.889> the<00:00:12.730> arc<00:00:13.630> reactor

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
for you this time it is the arc reactor

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.679 
for you this time it is the arc reactor
lab<00:00:14.530> it's<00:00:14.980> part<00:00:15.309> of<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.550> marvel<00:00:16.029> science<00:00:16.420> line

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
lab it's part of the marvel science line

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.589 
lab it's part of the marvel science line
from<00:00:17.290> Uncle<00:00:17.950> Milton<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:19.150> what<00:00:19.420> we're<00:00:19.509> going

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
from Uncle Milton and what we're going

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.729 
from Uncle Milton and what we're going
to<00:00:19.660> do<00:00:19.840> is<00:00:20.110> we're<00:00:20.259> going<00:00:20.349> to<00:00:20.439> put<00:00:20.619> together

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
to do is we're going to put together

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.420 
to do is we're going to put together
Iron<00:00:21.369> Man's<00:00:21.759> arc<00:00:22.210> reactor<00:00:22.950> so<00:00:23.950> what<00:00:24.130> do<00:00:24.189> you<00:00:24.279> do

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
Iron Man's arc reactor so what do you do

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.870 
Iron Man's arc reactor so what do you do
is<00:00:24.669> you<00:00:25.270> can<00:00:25.480> solve<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:26.079> to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:27.460> different

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
is you can solve it to do different

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.150 
is you can solve it to do different
lights<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.239> sound<00:00:28.509> combinations<00:00:29.439> get<00:00:30.040> the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
lights and sound combinations get the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.069 
lights and sound combinations get the
most<00:00:30.340> power<00:00:30.669> out<00:00:30.849> of<00:00:31.029> that<00:00:31.180> arc<00:00:31.509> reactor<00:00:32.050> I

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
most power out of that arc reactor I

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.560 
most power out of that arc reactor I
mean<00:00:32.320> I<00:00:32.500> know<00:00:32.800> from<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.160> comic<00:00:33.460> books<00:00:33.700> Ironman

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
mean I know from the comic books Ironman

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.090 
mean I know from the comic books Ironman
is<00:00:34.719> always<00:00:35.110> trying<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.350> get<00:00:35.469> more<00:00:35.649> power<00:00:35.890> out

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
is always trying to get more power out

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.490 
is always trying to get more power out
of<00:00:36.130> the<00:00:36.250> arc<00:00:36.399> reactor<00:00:36.580> and<00:00:37.030> he's<00:00:37.150> always

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
of the arc reactor and he's always

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.690 
of the arc reactor and he's always
losing<00:00:38.500> power<00:00:38.710> that's<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.370> know<00:00:39.490> the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
losing power that's you know the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.390 
losing power that's you know the
MacGuffin<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.330> lot<00:00:40.840> of<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:40.990> times<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:42.100> the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
MacGuffin a lot of the times in the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.750 
MacGuffin a lot of the times in the
series<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:44.680> this<00:00:44.920> we<00:00:45.250> get<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.490> try<00:00:45.700> to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
series so with this we get to try to

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.130 
series so with this we get to try to
build<00:00:47.100> Iron<00:00:48.100> Man's<00:00:48.340> arc<00:00:48.670> reactor<00:00:49.180> so<00:00:49.450> check<00:00:50.020> it

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
build Iron Man's arc reactor so check it

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.080 
build Iron Man's arc reactor so check it
out<00:00:50.230> what<00:00:50.380> we're<00:00:50.500> going<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.650> do<00:00:50.800> even<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:51.820> got<00:00:52.000> to

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
out what we're going to do even I got to

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.990 
out what we're going to do even I got to
build<00:00:52.240> this<00:00:52.390> together<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:53.730> take<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.850> along

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
build this together and take you along

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.609 
build this together and take you along
for<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.270> ride<00:01:03.390> okay<00:01:04.390> great<00:01:04.659> no<00:01:04.930> we'll<00:01:05.350> go<00:01:05.560> to

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
for the ride okay great no we'll go to

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.090 
for the ride okay great no we'll go to
the<00:01:05.770> next<00:01:05.950> step<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:08.049> next<00:01:08.079> step<00:01:08.620> looks

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
the next step and the next step looks

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.210 
the next step and the next step looks
like<00:01:09.370> attach<00:01:10.300> all<00:01:10.600> 6<00:01:11.140> reactor<00:01:11.260> joints<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
like attach all 6 reactor joints the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.790 
like attach all 6 reactor joints the
outside<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.790> arc<00:01:12.940> reactor<00:01:13.180> power<00:01:13.630> unit<00:01:13.990> so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
outside of the arc reactor power unit so

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.450 
outside of the arc reactor power unit so
these<00:01:14.920> are<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.240> reactor<00:01:16.240> joints<00:01:17.040> these<00:01:18.040> items

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
these are the reactor joints these items

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.160 
these are the reactor joints these items
and<00:01:19.000> they're<00:01:19.240> gonna<00:01:19.390> go<00:01:19.659> right<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:22.170> just

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
and they're gonna go right on here just

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.490 
and they're gonna go right on here just
like<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:25.330> right<00:01:25.479> here's<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.080> rest<00:01:26.409> of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
like that all right here's the rest of

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:47.420 
like that all right here's the rest of
those<00:01:31.740> yep

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:57.180 

I<00:01:48.430> bet<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.360> could<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:54.810> need<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.899> do<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.190> yeah

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
I bet you could I need to do it yeah

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.310 
I bet you could I need to do it yeah
okay<00:01:57.970> do<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.240> do<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.450> lined<00:01:58.600> up<00:01:58.720> right<00:02:01.320> all

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
okay do you do it lined up right all

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.570 
okay do you do it lined up right all
right<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:05.110> you've<00:02:05.320> has<00:02:05.440> attached<00:02:05.770> all<00:02:06.009> arc

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
right so you've has attached all arc

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.309 
right so you've has attached all arc
reactor<00:02:07.289> vents<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.729> joints<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.630> now<00:02:11.110> we

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
reactor vents and the joints and now we

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.630 
reactor vents and the joints and now we
have<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.739> insert<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.400> power<00:02:12.700> chips<00:02:13.180> into<00:02:14.640> into

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
have to insert the power chips into into

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.420 
have to insert the power chips into into
the<00:02:15.790> slots<00:02:16.120> here<00:02:16.420> now<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.590> power<00:02:17.920> chips

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the slots here now the power chips

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.710 
the slots here now the power chips
depending<00:02:19.360> upon<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:20.620> order<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.069> put<00:02:21.100> them<00:02:21.459> in

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
depending upon what order we put them in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.990 
depending upon what order we put them in
they'll<00:02:22.720> make<00:02:23.019> different<00:02:23.500> sounds<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
they'll make different sounds and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.080 
they'll make different sounds and
they'll<00:02:25.180> also<00:02:25.330> show<00:02:25.480> different<00:02:26.140> power<00:02:26.350> levels

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
they'll also show different power levels

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.300 
they'll also show different power levels
so<00:02:28.090> what<00:02:28.480> we're<00:02:28.630> attempting<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.560> level

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
so what we're attempting to do is level

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.449 
so what we're attempting to do is level
this<00:02:30.580> up<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.120> highest<00:02:31.480> power<00:02:32.459> available

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
this up to the highest power available

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.820 
this up to the highest power available
but<00:02:34.090> before<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.450> do<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:35.080> got<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.709> put

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
but before we do that you got to put

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.870 
but before we do that you got to put
some<00:02:36.010> batteries<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.950> our<00:02:39.100> arc<00:02:39.310> reactor

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
some batteries in it so our arc reactor

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.720 
some batteries in it so our arc reactor
lab<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.720> ready<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.530> start<00:02:41.739> testing<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
lab is ready to start testing so you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.729 
lab is ready to start testing so you
notice<00:02:43.180> these<00:02:43.360> little<00:02:43.660> points<00:02:44.230> here<00:02:44.410> these

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
notice these little points here these

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.199 
notice these little points here these
are<00:02:44.950> power<00:02:45.130> chips<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.549> are<00:02:45.610> automatically

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
are power chips that are automatically

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.410 
are power chips that are automatically
stay<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.989> now<00:02:47.590> these<00:02:47.890> points<00:02:48.579> are<00:02:48.790> where<00:02:49.329> you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
stay in now these points are where you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.470 
stay in now these points are where you
put<00:02:49.690> one<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.410> four<00:02:50.709> power<00:02:51.070> tips<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.850> to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
put one of the four power tips in to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.690 
put one of the four power tips in to
solve<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.959> problem<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:54.220> we're<00:02:54.400> trying<00:02:54.579> to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
solve the problem so we're trying to

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.390 
solve the problem so we're trying to
solve<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.239> make<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.780> arc<00:02:56.290> reactor<00:02:56.620> hit

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
solve to make the arc reactor hit

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.940 
solve to make the arc reactor hit
highest<00:02:57.790> power<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.870> there's<00:02:59.140> different<00:02:59.320> types

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
highest power so there's different types

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.680 
highest power so there's different types
of<00:03:00.220> chips<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.880> one<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.269> primary

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
of chips so this one is the primary

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.920 
of chips so this one is the primary
ignition<00:03:01.840> ignition<00:03:02.560> chip<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:04.209> one<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.600> chip

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
ignition ignition chip this one is chip

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.960 
ignition ignition chip this one is chip
number<00:03:05.079> one<00:03:05.440> number<00:03:06.070> two<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.640> number<00:03:06.730> three

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
number one number two and number three

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.420 
number one number two and number three
you<00:03:07.269> can<00:03:07.329> tell<00:03:07.630> by<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.560> lines<00:03:08.799> on<00:03:09.100> there

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
you can tell by the the lines on there

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.759 
you can tell by the the lines on there
so<00:03:09.760> those<00:03:09.970> four<00:03:10.180> chips<00:03:10.480> we<00:03:10.750> try<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.200> put<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.560> and

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
so those four chips we try to put in and

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.069 
so those four chips we try to put in and
what<00:03:12.250> we'll<00:03:12.459> do<00:03:12.640> like<00:03:12.970> scientists<00:03:13.570> do<00:03:13.840> is

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
what we'll do like scientists do is

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.810 
what we'll do like scientists do is
we're<00:03:14.680> going<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.950> test<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.579> try<00:03:15.760> different

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
we're going to test and try different

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.569 
we're going to test and try different
combinations<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.470> we're<00:03:17.890> gonna<00:03:18.010> start<00:03:18.370> and

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
combinations so we're gonna start and

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.390 
combinations so we're gonna start and
we're<00:03:19.090> going<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.269> put<00:03:19.420> in<00:03:19.540> zero<00:03:20.019> one<00:03:20.530> two<00:03:20.859> three

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
we're going to put in zero one two three

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.759 
we're going to put in zero one two three
in<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.060> different<00:03:22.570> holes<00:03:22.870> here<00:03:23.350> that

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
in the different holes here that

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.860 
in the different holes here that
correspond<00:03:24.430> with<00:03:24.519> where<00:03:24.910> we<00:03:25.030> put<00:03:25.299> our<00:03:25.480> chips

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
correspond with where we put our chips

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.289 
correspond with where we put our chips
so<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.739> figure<00:03:26.950> out<00:03:27.070> which<00:03:27.579> combination

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
so we can figure out which combination

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.099 
so we can figure out which combination
is<00:03:28.480> going<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.079> make<00:03:29.260> our<00:03:29.470> chip<00:03:30.310> set<00:03:30.840> power<00:03:31.840> up

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
is going to make our chip set power up

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.490 
is going to make our chip set power up
the<00:03:32.440> arc<00:03:33.040> reactor<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.000> highest<00:03:34.569> power<00:03:37.500> all

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the arc reactor to the highest power all

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.960 
the arc reactor to the highest power all
right<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.739> we<00:03:38.859> got<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.100> arc<00:03:39.280> reactor<00:03:39.519> pulled

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
right so we got the arc reactor pulled

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.110 
right so we got the arc reactor pulled
up<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.420> created<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.560> now<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:42.190> have<00:03:42.609> our<00:03:42.640> four

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
up and created and now we have our four

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.710 
up and created and now we have our four
chips<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.200> we're<00:03:44.560> gonna<00:03:44.680> try<00:03:45.010> out<00:03:45.720> putting

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
chips and we're gonna try out putting

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.430 
chips and we're gonna try out putting
them<00:03:46.900> together<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.160> making<00:03:48.400> sounds

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
them together and making sounds

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.820 
them together and making sounds
this<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:51.180> powered<00:03:51.600> ship<00:03:51.960> tracking<00:03:52.680> grid

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
this is the powered ship tracking grid

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.860 
this is the powered ship tracking grid
this<00:03:53.040> will<00:03:53.220> tell<00:03:53.430> us<00:03:53.460> where<00:03:54.240> we<00:03:54.390> put<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
this will tell us where we put the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.290 
this will tell us where we put the
different<00:03:55.260> power<00:03:55.440> chips<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:57.270> our

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
different power chips and then for our

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.150 
different power chips and then for our
testing<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.970> in<00:03:59.970> each<00:04:00.180> scenario<00:04:01.160> basically

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
testing so in each scenario basically

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.380 
testing so in each scenario basically
you<00:04:02.580> put<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.000> ignition<00:04:03.900> chip<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.030> this

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
you put the ignition chip so this this

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
you put the ignition chip so this this
ignition<00:04:06.870> chip<00:04:07.200> here<00:04:08.540> that's<00:04:09.540> gonna<00:04:09.690> go<00:04:09.930> in

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
ignition chip here that's gonna go in

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.000 
ignition chip here that's gonna go in
this<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.850> slot<00:04:12.090> every<00:04:12.570> time<00:04:12.780> because<00:04:13.680> you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
this in this slot every time because you

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.950 
this in this slot every time because you
know<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.390> only<00:04:15.510> one<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.780> will

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
know that it's the only one that will

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.509 
know that it's the only one that will
let<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.200> make<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> sound<00:04:16.769> when<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.130> push<00:04:17.370> it

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
let you make a sound when you push it

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.550 
let you make a sound when you push it
down<00:04:17.630> okay<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:18.690> that's<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.140> only<00:04:19.290> one<00:04:19.440> that

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
down okay so that's the only one that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.090 
down okay so that's the only one that
will<00:04:19.650> do<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:20.330> so<00:04:21.330> that<00:04:21.480> means<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:22.140> when<00:04:22.950> you

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
will do that so that means that when you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.720 
will do that so that means that when you
try<00:04:23.490> each<00:04:24.360> time<00:04:24.890> you<00:04:25.890> have<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.400> other<00:04:26.520> three

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
try each time you have the other three

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.030 
try each time you have the other three
other<00:04:29.730> three<00:04:30.030> chips<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:31.200> put<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.500> which<00:04:31.800> means

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
other three chips to put in which means

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.080 
other three chips to put in which means
you<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.310> six<00:04:32.610> possible<00:04:33.240> combinations<00:04:34.140> okay

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
you have six possible combinations okay

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.050 
you have six possible combinations okay
so<00:04:36.090> we<00:04:36.210> tried<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.480> methodically<00:04:37.260> we<00:04:37.470> put<00:04:38.060> chip

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
so we tried it methodically we put chip

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.540 
so we tried it methodically we put chip
number<00:04:39.390> one<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.920> see<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.070> little<00:04:41.340> one

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
number one you can see a little one

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.290 
number one you can see a little one
stripe<00:04:41.940> there<00:04:43.460> in<00:04:44.460> this<00:04:44.790> position<00:04:46.610> here<00:04:47.610> and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
stripe there in this position here and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.780 
stripe there in this position here and
then<00:04:49.250> we<00:04:50.250> did<00:04:50.570> chip<00:04:51.570> number<00:04:52.050> two<00:04:52.430> here<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:53.700> we

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
then we did chip number two here so we

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.290 
then we did chip number two here so we
did<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.450> two<00:04:54.630> three<00:04:55.020> first<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:56.940> know<00:04:57.000> we<00:04:57.090> try

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
did one two three first you know we try

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.050 
did one two three first you know we try
that<00:04:57.710> first<00:05:00.110> okay<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:02.400> then<00:05:02.520> we<00:05:02.640> have<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.850> put

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
that first okay and then we have to put

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.540 
that first okay and then we have to put
the<00:05:03.270> cover<00:05:03.810> back<00:05:03.930> on<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:06.440> then<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:08.310> push<00:05:08.520> it

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
the cover back on and then you push it

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.300 
the cover back on and then you push it
down<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:12.260> you'll<00:05:13.260> notice<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.980> did<00:05:14.280> not

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
down and you'll notice that that did not

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.490 
down and you'll notice that that did not
achieve<00:05:14.580> full<00:05:15.030> power<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.540> you<00:05:15.840> keep<00:05:16.110> changing

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
achieve full power so you keep changing

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.190 
achieve full power so you keep changing
the<00:05:16.830> three<00:05:17.520> chips<00:05:18.060> chips<00:05:18.570> one<00:05:18.840> through<00:05:19.020> three

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
the three chips chips one through three

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.230 
the three chips chips one through three
over<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:20.190> over<00:05:20.460> until<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:21.180> get<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.560> correct

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
over and over until you get the correct

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.530 
over and over until you get the correct
full<00:05:24.240> powerup<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.650> arc<00:05:26.520> reactors<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.270> you

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
full powerup of the arc reactors and you

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.840 
full powerup of the arc reactors and you
use<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> pencil<00:05:28.590> let<00:05:29.070> me<00:05:29.160> see<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.370> pencil<00:05:29.580> there

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
use a pencil let me see the pencil there

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.960 
use a pencil let me see the pencil there
sweetie<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.800> you'll<00:05:32.010> use<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.220> pencil<00:05:32.550> on

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
sweetie and so you'll use a pencil on

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.250 
sweetie and so you'll use a pencil on
this<00:05:33.510> grid<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.310> in<00:05:35.310> this<00:05:35.460> case<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.810> know<00:05:36.930> chip

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
this grid and in this case you know chip

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.730 
this grid and in this case you know chip
zero<00:05:37.590> goes<00:05:37.919> here<00:05:39.530> okay<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:40.590> we<00:05:40.950> did<00:05:42.140> one<00:05:43.910> two

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
zero goes here okay so we did one two

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280 
zero goes here okay so we did one two
three<00:05:46.740> that<00:05:47.130> first<00:05:47.490> time<00:05:47.669> and<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.810> kind<00:05:49.200> of

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
three that first time and it kind of

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.850 
three that first time and it kind of
shorted<00:05:49.680> out<00:05:50.930> so<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.169> so<00:05:52.350> we'll<00:05:52.500> do<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.650> and

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
shorted out so and so we'll do that and

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.980 
shorted out so and so we'll do that and
it<00:05:53.160> will<00:05:53.280> go<00:05:53.400> through<00:05:53.669> each<00:05:53.820> one<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:54.330> we'll<00:05:54.840> do

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
it will go through each one and we'll do

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.290 
it will go through each one and we'll do
it<00:05:55.290> until<00:05:55.680> we<00:05:55.800> get<00:05:55.919> to<00:05:56.070> full<00:05:56.250> power<00:05:56.430> now<00:05:57.240> the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
it until we get to full power now the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.219 
it until we get to full power now the
arc<00:05:58.260> reactor<00:05:58.500> itself<00:05:58.950> has<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.850> little<00:06:00.300> display

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
arc reactor itself has a little display

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.090 
arc reactor itself has a little display
stand

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
stand

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.670 
stand
and<00:06:02.190> there<00:06:03.030> are<00:06:03.150> different<00:06:03.420> modes<00:06:03.600> so<00:06:04.110> we<00:06:04.500> have

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
and there are different modes so we have

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.450 
and there are different modes so we have
it<00:06:04.800> in<00:06:04.890> lab<00:06:05.160> mode<00:06:05.780> right<00:06:06.780> now<00:06:07.040> so<00:06:08.040> that<00:06:08.160> we<00:06:08.280> can

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
it in lab mode right now so that we can

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.430 
it in lab mode right now so that we can
do<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.940> experiment<00:06:09.360> but<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.050> also<00:06:10.170> has

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
do the experiment but it also has

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.270 
do the experiment but it also has
nightlight<00:06:10.980> mode<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.550> so<00:06:12.210> nightlight<00:06:12.720> mode

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
nightlight mode and so nightlight mode

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.310 
nightlight mode and so nightlight mode
when<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.370> switch<00:06:14.580> it<00:06:14.700> to<00:06:14.820> that<00:06:16.340> okay<00:06:18.140> you<00:06:19.140> get

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
when you switch it to that okay you get

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.360 
when you switch it to that okay you get
a<00:06:19.560> fully<00:06:20.160> powered-up<00:06:20.550> arc<00:06:20.880> reactor<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.710> that's

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
a fully powered-up arc reactor so that's

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.750 
a fully powered-up arc reactor so that's
full<00:06:23.640> power<00:06:23.880> and<00:06:24.390> we<00:06:25.350> can<00:06:25.380> use<00:06:26.340> that<00:06:26.550> as<00:06:26.730> a

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
full power and we can use that as a

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.590 
full power and we can use that as a
nightlight<00:06:27.500> it'll<00:06:28.500> be<00:06:28.740> on<00:06:29.040> for<00:06:29.520> 15<00:06:30.030> minutes

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
nightlight it'll be on for 15 minutes

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.840 
nightlight it'll be on for 15 minutes
and<00:06:30.690> then<00:06:31.560> I'll<00:06:31.680> automatically<00:06:32.220> turn<00:06:32.400> off<00:06:32.640> so

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
and then I'll automatically turn off so

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.820 
and then I'll automatically turn off so
you<00:06:32.910> can<00:06:33.030> use<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.330> as<00:06:33.420> a<00:06:33.480> nightlight<00:06:33.870> in

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
you can use it as a nightlight in

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.760 
you can use it as a nightlight in
addition<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.490> lab<00:06:35.970> program<00:06:36.780> it's<00:06:37.560> pretty

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
addition to a lab program it's pretty

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.010 
addition to a lab program it's pretty
fun<00:06:38.010> it<00:06:38.340> teaches<00:06:39.000> kids<00:06:39.090> about<00:06:39.360> the<00:06:39.600> scientific

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
fun it teaches kids about the scientific

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.090 
fun it teaches kids about the scientific
method<00:06:40.170> being<00:06:40.800> able<00:06:40.950> to<00:06:41.240> go<00:06:42.240> through<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:43.100> try

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
method being able to go through and try

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.950 
method being able to go through and try
different<00:06:44.250> things<00:06:44.730> to<00:06:45.180> achieve<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.600> result

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
different things to achieve the result

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.800 
different things to achieve the result
that<00:06:46.080> they<00:06:46.230> want<00:06:46.500> and<00:06:46.740> it's<00:06:47.730> I<00:06:48.120> think<00:06:48.570> it's<00:06:48.750> a

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
that they want and it's I think it's a

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.880 
that they want and it's I think it's a
lot<00:06:48.900> of<00:06:48.960> fun<00:06:49.260> and<00:06:50.900> you<00:06:51.900> know<00:06:51.990> we<00:06:52.440> had<00:06:52.590> we<00:06:52.740> had<00:06:52.860> a

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
lot of fun and you know we had we had a

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.280 
lot of fun and you know we had we had a
