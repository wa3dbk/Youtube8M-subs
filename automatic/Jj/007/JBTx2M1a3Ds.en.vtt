board let's go Eddie get it on open oh

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.020 
board let's go Eddie get it on open oh
it<00:00:34.829> looks<00:00:35.070> nice<00:00:37.010> put<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> board<00:00:38.340> aside<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it looks nice put the board aside for a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.530 
it looks nice put the board aside for a
second<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:39.750> looks<00:00:40.620> gorgeous<00:00:40.860> however

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540

sorry<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.239> busy<00:00:54.420> gaming<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.800> back<00:00:56.100> panel

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
sorry I'm busy gaming the back panel

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
sorry I'm busy gaming the back panel
which<00:00:57.000> there's<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.989> actually<00:00:58.170> disappointed

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
which there's I'm actually disappointed

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
which there's I'm actually disappointed
to<00:00:59.370> see<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> does<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.590> any<00:01:02.270> padding

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
to see that it does not have any padding

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
to see that it does not have any padding
on<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.530> least<00:01:04.650> black<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> red

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
on it but it is at least black and red

on it but it is at least black and red
so<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> looks<00:01:05.880> nice<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:07.220> biggest<00:01:08.220> case<00:01:08.460> badge

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so it looks nice the biggest case badge

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:21.810 
so it looks nice the biggest case badge

we have the nice dragon your 1150 socket
another<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.520> CPU<00:01:44.000> fan<00:01:44.270> header<00:01:45.400> CPU

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
another this is the CPU fan header CPU

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.530 
another this is the CPU fan header CPU
fan<00:01:46.610> header<00:01:46.720> 2<00:01:47.720> we<00:01:48.410> have<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.860> four<00:01:49.100> DDR<00:01:49.640> so

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
fan header 2 we have your four DDR so

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.020 
fan header 2 we have your four DDR so
down<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.840> side<00:01:51.020> we<00:01:51.200> have<00:01:51.320> your<00:01:51.470> 24<00:01:52.070> pin<00:01:52.310> your

USB 3 another system fan 6 SATA and if
you<00:02:00.520> use<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.760> mSATA<00:02:02.180> which<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.570> under<00:02:02.810> this

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
you use the mSATA which is under this

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.610 
you use the mSATA which is under this
cover<00:02:03.370> port<00:02:04.370> 6<00:02:04.700> will<00:02:04.940> be<00:02:05.090> disabled<00:02:05.690> ok<00:02:06.530> so

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
cover port 6 will be disabled ok so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.950 
cover port 6 will be disabled ok so
along<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.070> bottom<00:02:07.220> we<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.640> front<00:02:08.630> panel

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
along the bottom we have front panel

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.950 
printer because people have those still
I<00:02:16.670> guess<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.410> your<00:02:19.010> front<00:02:19.220> panel<00:02:19.340> audio<00:02:19.960> and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
I guess and your front panel audio and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.680 
I guess and your front panel audio and
of<00:02:21.170> course<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.530> has<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> audio<00:02:22.220> boost<00:02:22.700> so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
of course this has the audio boost so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.150 
of course this has the audio boost so
for<00:02:24.230> your<00:02:24.320> back<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.620> hope<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:25.220> have<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:26.060> combo<00:02:27.160> ps2

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
