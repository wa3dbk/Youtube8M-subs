00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.060
 I promised you I would make a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.069
 new de corato 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 then here we have the mold we take 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.940
 the dried fruit and we are going to lay it on 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 bottom of one of the two mid summer 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.560
 noticing I put it all on one 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 single surface on one floor only 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.300
 I have to do a whole surface to one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 only layer of fruit also the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.519
 soft dried fruit like apricots 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.920
 kiwi and hazelnut the important thing 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 I repeat is that everything is done only on one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 surface you prepare it before 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 temper the chocolate and mold it like this 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 is ready for use we bring the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
 our chocolate melted at 45 degrees because 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.950
 we are talking about milk chocolate 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.579
 at this point I take a part of the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.710
 chocolate and I'm going to pour it on a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.420
 marble top towards the chocolate on the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.090
 marble top the spatula on the left 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.340
 scraper on the right and we do 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.760
 this movement, that is to say, we enlarge upon 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.049
 surface of the marble floor and when 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.049
 we have expanded over the entire surface 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:19.049
 if you want a scraper on the spatula 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:22.369
 we report in the center and at this point it is 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.369
 The time has come to collect it 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.479
 in a bowl and I go with this 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.479
 movement to pick it up 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.560
 the famous grade we have to pick up 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.360
 we do it by adding chocolate 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.910
 what we kept warm in 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.620
 bowl aside and mix to this 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.140
 point we always keep our bowl 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.750
 raised from the hand plane to prevent it 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.810
 keep cool and take it 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.930
 new our press we come a sac a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.100
 few and pour the sac Ã  poche on 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.500
 melted chocolate 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.970
 now it is at this point we do the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.440
 stitch all around the edge of the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 fruit staff so the evening seam 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:18.070
 so to attach the fruit the mold is 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.560
 then so now so the mold we go to 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.690
 put in the fridge to make 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.160
 crystallize a second the chocolate 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.260
 what do you see I have spoken just one 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.090
 moment with you and the chocolate I would say that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.850
 is already ready at this point I go to 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 strain the chocolate as you were 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.500
 new normal ie I don't care anymore 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.420
 of decoration but I'm going to strain the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 chocolate as if it were a new smooth 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:50.470
 rotary movement we turn upside down 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:56.290
 we are ready to take a spatula e 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.519
 we beat ok 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.709
 we take our pan as we have 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.140
 done before and let's crystallize 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.720
 in reverse 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.430
 in this way chocolate 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.310
 obviously I've already said the other one 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.250
 first it must be recovered immediately in order to be able to 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.110
 use for other things is we go again 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.110
 store it in the refrigerator 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.439
 here we have another mold that I am 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.599
 of the bases this is the basis of the 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.189
 tape our support and with the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.439
 We also do a tempered chocolate 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.260
 base the same to make the basis of the 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.790
 place like that and let's go to reese turn it 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.560
 this time directly into the mold that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.989
 we can 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.419
 and this is our base let's see how 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:47.689
 we are put with the first step yes 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.769
 perfect as it was in the refrigerator 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:56.750
 been a minute with minutes was already 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:00.250
 enough to make the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.719
 chocolate and let's go to scrape the tails 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.719
 and let's do the second courage 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:23.850
 we rotate we flip we see 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.590
 the fruit also through the mold that 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.100
 all stuck there that doesn't move 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.020
 we practically made it withheld 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.900
 through this crystallized chocolate 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.900
 and not to put it back in the refrigerator 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.020
 now I had left a 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.090
 crystallize in the fridge once is 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.590
 crystallized we cleaned the latter 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.449
 things like we did the first step 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.210
 and we find ourselves here we have the two 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.860
 half the first and the second with fruit 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.430
 dry and more we have a round base 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.620
 take the pan around 50 degrees 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.740
 let's do this job before we attack 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.990
 the two halves then one and two 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.940
 if we do not notice it does not heat up 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.220
 so ari it happens that maybe later 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.830
 remains more laundry in one place and there 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.319
 let the base dry I go to 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.749
 flatten as well as chocolate 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.349
 struggling to stick chocolate on 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.079
 chocolate 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:29.779
 let's go back to the stripes to do more 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:32.329
 friction then line here at this point 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:34.849
 I take chocolate and go and put one 

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:36.739
 beautiful chocolate chips so I take 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.669
 also the egg and I'm going to flatten also 

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:39.669
 the egg like that 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.759
 where you throw it over mine 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.800
 by lightly pressing him he is firm 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:54.990
 at this point we make two mice for 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.419
 make it nice with marzipan ok 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.330
 and then the tiny little balls that 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:05.280
 makes the nose we attach a little mouse in the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:10.860
 high part here is a little mouse we put it 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.930
 in the lower part if we wish we can also 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.759
 complete with some other fruit ie 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.919
 attack some fruit that this is 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.580
 just an example of how to make a 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.580
 new de corato
