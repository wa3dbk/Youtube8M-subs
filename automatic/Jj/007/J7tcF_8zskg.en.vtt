please remember to wash the filter with
plenty<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.410> water<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.640> all<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
down into the receiving flask when you

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.310 
down into the receiving flask when you
are<00:01:27.280> done<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:28.210> filter<00:01:28.660> should<00:01:28.690> be<00:01:28.960> white

SMB the SMB is first dissolved in water

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.290 
SMB the SMB is first dissolved in water
and<00:01:47.020> then<00:01:47.740> added<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.430> stirred<00:01:48.850> gold

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
and then added to a stirred gold

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.680 
and then added to a stirred gold
solution<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.619> SMB<00:01:51.250> will<00:01:51.729> react<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:52.509> the

solution the SMB will react with the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.230 
solution the SMB will react with the
gold<00:01:52.930> ions<00:01:53.290> in<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.619> solution<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:54.310> reduce<00:01:55.060> it

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
gold ions in the solution and reduce it

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.620 
gold ions in the solution and reduce it
to<00:01:55.270> metallic<00:01:55.869> gold<00:01:56.200> powder<00:01:56.530> as<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.399> result<00:01:57.910> some

to metallic gold powder as a result some

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.350 
to metallic gold powder as a result some
sulfur<00:01:59.110> dioxide<00:01:59.740> gas<00:01:59.979> will<00:02:00.280> release<00:02:00.640> it's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
sulfur dioxide gas will release it's

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.690 
sulfur dioxide gas will release it's
pretty<00:02:01.600> toxic<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> reaction<00:02:02.890> must<00:02:03.460> be

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
pretty toxic so the reaction must be

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.810 
pretty toxic so the reaction must be
done<00:02:03.940> under<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.360> fume<00:02:04.780> hood<00:02:04.920> by<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:05.979> way<00:02:06.220> you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
done under a fume hood by the way you

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.430 
done under a fume hood by the way you
don't<00:02:07.060> really<00:02:07.180> have<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.570> use<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.750> magnetic

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
don't really have to use a magnetic

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.949 
don't really have to use a magnetic

process<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.900> repeated<00:03:35.080> until<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:36.070> acid<00:03:36.520> wash

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
process is repeated until the acid wash

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.230 
process is repeated until the acid wash
doesn't<00:03:37.570> gain<00:03:37.780> any<00:03:37.810> color<00:03:38.350> anymore

it usually takes 3 to 5 washes in
between<00:03:43.990> each<00:03:44.200> acid<00:03:44.740> wash<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.700> would<00:03:45.850> be<00:03:45.940> a

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
between each acid wash it would be a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.630 
between each acid wash it would be a
good<00:03:46.270> idea<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.870> do<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.020> quick<00:03:47.290> water<00:03:47.680> wash<00:03:47.980> so

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
good idea to do a quick water wash so

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520 
good idea to do a quick water wash so
that<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> better<00:03:49.210> indication<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.990> color<00:03:50.200> change

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that a better indication of color change

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.970 
that a better indication of color change
can<00:03:51.100> be<00:03:51.220> seen<00:03:51.490> on<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> next<00:03:52.060> wash<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.860> like<00:03:53.860> to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
can be seen on the next wash I like to

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.560 
can be seen on the next wash I like to
keep<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.280> acid<00:03:54.610> washes<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.180> separate

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
keep the acid washes in a separate

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.600 
keep the acid washes in a separate
container<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.140> use<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.830> later<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.130> dissolve

container and use it later to dissolve

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:14.940 
container and use it later to dissolve
more<00:03:57.850> dirty<00:03:58.180> gold

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.699 

take<00:04:15.819> a<00:04:15.849> close<00:04:16.269> look<00:04:16.419> at<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.840> powder<00:04:17.049> after

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
take a close look at the powder after

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.430 
take a close look at the powder after
the<00:04:17.829> acid<00:04:18.220> washes<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:19.450> color<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:20.019> clearly

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
the acid washes the color is clearly

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.040 
the acid washes the color is clearly
lighter<00:04:20.799> which<00:04:21.579> is<00:04:21.760> another<00:04:22.090> good<00:04:22.360> indication

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
lighter which is another good indication

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.010 
lighter which is another good indication
for<00:04:23.290> purity<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.760> powder<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.330> later<00:04:25.690> washed

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
for purity the powder is later washed

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.710 
for purity the powder is later washed
several<00:04:26.560> times<00:04:26.919> with<00:04:27.550> distilled<00:04:28.180> water<00:04:28.300> and
