00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hello everyone, I am matteo and this is the 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.910
 focus on the contu precise on 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.009
 as already explained other times the focuses 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.990
 sleep are nothing but one 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.820
 collection of small exercises for 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.510
 immediately become familiar with this 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.760
 30 this movement in particular 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 needs two or three precautions first 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 of everything to learn immediately from where 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 detached so understand where to start 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.080
 to jump before the obstacle to do 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.870
 dive and make contact with 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.120
 the obstacle and then there is to learn and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.699
 become familiar with the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.010
 positivity of the hands of the arms of the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 basin and then understand how 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.909
 push and change position in the air 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.369
 to land 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.960
 then this time I'm on the given tube 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.860
 that I had been asked several times about 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.780
 explain the 5th or the mountain 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.240
 a team right now I've decided 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 put me on the turbo simply for 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.280
 since we went ahead with the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.040
 movements now we're doing more things 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 advanced intermediate 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 is that we are facing the movements 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 hybrids is very important to you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.680
 learn to apply it on 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 always different surfaces and in this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.550
 case I am under the bomber give you a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 notion more but we pass immediately 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.970
 action 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.930
 the first obstacle you will find is to understand 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.150
 how to get their hands on many think of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 grab behind or from below but 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.080
 grabbing from above you will have another one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.660
 spirit 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.790
 another important thing is the thumb does it 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.460
 put under the turbo and if it won't block 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 part of your momentum but they are too many 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.170
 and keeping the hand of successful in the way 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.170
 explained and you will get an optimal 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.800
 another thing to train is to understand the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.989
 right distance from which to disconnect for 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.750
 just start your distance 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.820
 extended leg from which to start the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.420
 plunge into the obstacle and hold on 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.920
 of it from above as already explained 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.630
 throw too close by diving vi 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.420
 against the obstacle nailing to the ground 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.790
 are two common mistakes 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.510
 train a lot and learn measures and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.510
 correct postures 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 so remember to keep some 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:55.579
 distance from the mold to then perform 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:57.650
 the plunge and take hold of them a 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.780
 another exercise I recommend is 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.549
 that of the stick in the absence of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.349
 this you can use a piece one leaf 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.840
 of paper a pebble any other 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.709
 what to use then on the ground like 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.239
 reference point to start 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.260
 put the reference point on 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.389
 four steps from the obstacle each time 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.510
 you give it a try 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.340
 land near the reference point 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.170
 move it a little more so as to 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.560
 increase the distance from each time 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.560
 having to reach 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.060
 last thing to exercise and momentum 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.470
 of the obstacle that I call the pied 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.360
 it is a momentum that takes 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.200
 strength from the legs is a process that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.120
 separated 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.620
 thanks to the help of the arms it allows 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.360
 the taste of leaning forward 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.209
 taking the momentum from the bottom up 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.400
 up to 45 degrees as if climbing one 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.470
 ramp this way you will have more 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.480
 relationships you will have extra space for 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.830
 legs and thus reaching greater 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.830
 distance behind the obstacle 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:53.719
 then for today it's all and I hope to 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.409
 having been useful again with 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:59.900
 as mentioned this type of video serves 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.389
 to give you exercises to understand 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.150
 better how to deal with this movement 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.669
 or less afraid with fewer mental blocks or 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.740
 physical then the stick exercise 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.210
 for example it is very practical to play 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.759
 alone or with your companions 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.830
 training for those who push more and 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.920
 he clarified further than automatically 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.020
 becomes a game to improve 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.850
 any kind of friendly competition between 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.640
 of you that can be very useful to 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.040
 learning purposes then remember 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.840
 that everything needs time needs 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.180
 to be assimilated by the body and 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.520
 mind to get muscle memory 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.800
 so don't rush and give del 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.170
 time to everything and it will be much more 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.240
 practical to understand where to remove how 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.330
 get your hands on how to stream theater and 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.430
 getting distance report ready 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.220
 then 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.310
 as I always say, give time to time and 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.310
 you are born this thing and you have asked me 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.590
 many of them make the crew of this 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.450
 movement but since it is a column that 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.210
 has arrived a little late here I say 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.340
 first face more than all 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.380
 others and tutorials that I have already addressed 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.720
 for now I only did the first one 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.150
 this is the focus of the fourteenth 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.880
 tutorial so I still have to do more or 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.970
 less another 12 improve before dedicating 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.650
 time again to the precise account in the 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.280
 meanwhile as already explained on mine 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.260
 facebook page I will dedicate the next 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.600
 you mainly go out on the technique 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.680
 because this is how you prepare yourself for the summer 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.860
 a fantastic season for 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.830
 the workout and you will surely have all 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.960
 something to do and for the rest time 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.289
 less than a month start my own 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.409
 workshop that soon 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.990
 bring out a video in which I give details 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.479
 of the stages the dates to contact for 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.589
 join the various stages around 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.909
 Italy 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:53.339
 I will start on June 6th, and the 8th is over 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.990
 August there will be more or less five six 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.749
 stages that I have already advertised on 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.520
 facebook page and also on my website www 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:02.490
 there is on stage com 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.050
 for the rest, good training for all of us 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.050
 let's see in the next video tutorial
