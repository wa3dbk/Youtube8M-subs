covering the m27 versus the scar-h as
you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> stats<00:00:31.259> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.470> screen

you can see from the stats on the screen

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
you can see from the stats on the screen
the<00:00:32.519> scar-h<00:00:32.850> first<00:00:33.420> off<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.960> high<00:00:34.199> damage

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the scar-h first off is a high damage

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.369 
the scar-h first off is a high damage
high<00:00:35.010> range<00:00:35.339> weapon<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.510> fire<00:00:36.900> rate<00:00:37.199> is<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
high range weapon the fire rate is a

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.250 
high range weapon the fire rate is a
little<00:00:37.500> less<00:00:37.980> than<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.400> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> m27<00:00:39.660> but

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
little less than that of the m27 but

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
little less than that of the m27 but
overall<00:00:40.589> it's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.949> fairly<00:00:41.250> strong<00:00:41.579> weapon<00:00:41.909> as

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
overall it's a fairly strong weapon as

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600 
overall it's a fairly strong weapon as
you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.900> see<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> m27<00:00:44.100> has<00:00:44.370> decent

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you can see here the m27 has decent

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.360 
you can see here the m27 has decent
accuracy<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> short<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> medium<00:00:46.800> range<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
accuracy at a short to medium range and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.439 
accuracy at a short to medium range and
the<00:00:47.430> thing<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.090> this

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
the thing I really like about this

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.810 
the thing I really like about this
weapon<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.320> has<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> quick<00:00:49.860> reload<00:00:50.309> compared

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
weapon is it has a quick reload compared

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.330 
weapon is it has a quick reload compared
to<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> scar-h<00:00:52.010> now<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> iron

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to that of the scar-h now the iron

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
to that of the scar-h now the iron
sights<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.760> weapon<00:00:53.940> aren't<00:00:54.359> affordable

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
sights on this weapon aren't affordable

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
sights on this weapon aren't affordable
but<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:55.890> i'm<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.399> medium-range

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but when i'm going for medium-range

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.759 
but when i'm going for medium-range
kills<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.359> do<00:00:57.420> prefer<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> reflex

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
kills i do prefer to use the reflex

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.319 
kills i do prefer to use the reflex
sight<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.519> because<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> gives<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.239> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
sight just because it gives me in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.919 
sight just because it gives me in
greater<00:01:00.539> accuracy<00:01:00.930> over<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.620> range<00:01:02.690> now<00:01:03.690> one

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
greater accuracy over that range now one

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.270 
greater accuracy over that range now one
thing<00:01:03.960> you'll<00:01:04.259> notice<00:01:04.410> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> check<00:01:05.039> out<00:01:05.160> the

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
that the m27 does have slightly less

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
recoil than that of the scar-h but if

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
recoil than that of the scar-h but if
you<00:01:12.929> played<00:01:13.229> black<00:01:13.500> ops<00:01:13.679> 2<00:01:14.009> you<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.490> know

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
that most weapons in this game you don't

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.550 
that most weapons in this game you don't
really<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> whole<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.940> recoil<00:01:18.560> now

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
really have a whole lot of recoil now

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.540 
really have a whole lot of recoil now
i'm<00:01:19.649> not<00:01:19.800> sure<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.069> they're<00:01:20.190> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.399> any

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
i'm not sure if they're going to any

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.339 
i'm not sure if they're going to any
fixes<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.209> know<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> patch<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:21.990> anything

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.349 
fixes you know put a patch or anything

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.559 
fixes you know put a patch or anything
as<00:01:22.530> far<00:01:22.709> as<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> recoil<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.429> concerned<00:01:23.849> but<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
as far as a recoil is concerned but one

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.419 
as far as a recoil is concerned but one
thing<00:01:24.720> i<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.349> about<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
thing i really do like about this is it

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:27.800 
thing i really do like about this is it
makes<00:01:26.640> most<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> weapons<00:01:27.300> in<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> game

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
makes most of the weapons in the game

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.620 
makes most of the weapons in the game
usable<00:01:31.340> moving<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:32.459> the<00:01:32.580> scar-h<00:01:32.940> what<00:01:33.599> I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
usable moving on to the scar-h what I

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570 
usable moving on to the scar-h what I
really<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.410> high<00:01:34.739> damage<00:01:35.099> in<00:01:35.369> high

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
really like is the high damage in high

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.699 
really like is the high damage in high
range<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.239> weapon<00:01:36.599> has<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.530> makes

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
range that this weapon has and it makes

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.290 
range that this weapon has and it makes
it<00:01:37.830> really<00:01:38.099> capable<00:01:38.429> of<00:01:38.729> putting<00:01:38.910> people<00:01:39.270> down

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
it really capable of putting people down

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.800 
it really capable of putting people down
no<00:01:40.110> matter<00:01:40.289> what<00:01:40.649> range<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.429> now<00:01:41.810> when

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
no matter what range they're at now when

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
no matter what range they're at now when
running<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.319> scar-h<00:01:43.709> like<00:01:44.220> most<00:01:44.459> of<00:01:44.580> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
running with the scar-h like most of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
running with the scar-h like most of the
assault<00:01:44.940> rifles<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.599> do<00:01:45.869> prefer<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.709> use<00:01:46.830> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
assault rifles I do prefer to use the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
assault rifles I do prefer to use the
reflex<00:01:47.459> sight<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.940> it's<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> there's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
reflex sight and it's not that there's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
reflex sight and it's not that there's
an<00:01:48.720> issue<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.440> iron<00:01:49.649> sights<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
an issue with the iron sights in this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.309 
an issue with the iron sights in this
one<00:01:50.399> either<00:01:50.429> it's<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.660> that<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.200> when

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
one either it's just that you know when

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.660 
one either it's just that you know when
you're<00:01:52.410> doing<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.739> those<00:01:52.860> medium<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.520> long

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you're doing in those medium to long

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
you're doing in those medium to long
range<00:01:53.700> mills<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:55.080> want<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.319> extra

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
range mills you really want the extra

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
accuracy that that provides now I really

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.550

recommend this for any class setup is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.649 
recommend this for any class setup is
using<00:02:34.099> hard<00:02:34.400> line<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.000> reason<00:02:35.360> for<00:02:35.569> this

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
using hard line and the reason for this

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.899 
using hard line and the reason for this
is<00:02:35.720> if<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.620> ask<00:02:36.799> anybody<00:02:37.099> who's<00:02:37.400> played<00:02:37.670> black

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
is if you ask anybody who's played black

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.550 
is if you ask anybody who's played black
ops<00:02:38.090> 2<00:02:38.420> they'll<00:02:38.959> tell<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
ops 2 they'll tell you that the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.319 
ops 2 they'll tell you that the
killstreaks<00:02:40.159> are<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> lot<00:02:40.609> harder<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:41.090> come<00:02:41.299> by

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
killstreaks are a lot harder to come by

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.720 
killstreaks are a lot harder to come by
so<00:02:42.170> by<00:02:42.470> using<00:02:42.530> hardline<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.519> beat<00:02:43.640> your

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
so by using hardline you beat your

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.059 
so by using hardline you beat your
killstreaks<00:02:44.299> more<00:02:44.510> often<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.049> at<00:02:45.680> least<00:02:45.859> as

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
killstreaks more often and at least as

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.770 
killstreaks more often and at least as
far<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.400> I'm<00:02:46.519> concerned<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.450> makes<00:02:47.629> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
far as I'm concerned this just makes the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.129 
far as I'm concerned this just makes the
game<00:02:47.930> overall<00:02:48.349> more<00:02:48.769> enjoyable<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.930> we've
