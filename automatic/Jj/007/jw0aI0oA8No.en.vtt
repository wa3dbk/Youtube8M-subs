one<00:00:00.390> of<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.539> really<00:00:00.810> nice<00:00:00.900> features<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.319> this

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
one of the really nice features of this

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.470 
one of the really nice features of this
workbench<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.100> that<00:00:02.280> large<00:00:02.490> contrasting<00:00:03.270> end

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
workbench is that large contrasting end

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.079 
workbench is that large contrasting end
cap<00:00:03.720> with<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.049> dovetail<00:00:04.529> now<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.850> bench

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
cap with the dovetail now on this bench

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.059 
cap with the dovetail now on this bench
the<00:00:06.480> end<00:00:06.779> cap<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.140> more<00:00:07.350> than<00:00:07.470> just<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the end cap is more than just a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.290 
the end cap is more than just a
good-looking<00:00:08.280> bit<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.730> wood<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.059> also

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
good-looking bit of wood it's also

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240 
good-looking bit of wood it's also
houses<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> tail<00:00:10.230> vise<00:00:10.469> which<00:00:10.769> means<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> has

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
houses the tail vise which means it has

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.640 
houses the tail vise which means it has
to<00:00:11.400> be<00:00:11.429> strong<00:00:11.849> now<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.780> order<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> gain

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
to be strong now in order for it to gain

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.289 
to be strong now in order for it to gain
that<00:00:13.860> strength<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.370> need<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.549> really<00:00:14.849> large

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
that strength we need a really large

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.380 
that strength we need a really large
tenon<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> end<00:00:16.680> cap<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.010> sit<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:18.180> in

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
tenon for the end cap to sit on now in

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630 
tenon for the end cap to sit on now in
my<00:00:18.539> plans<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.020> suggest<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.800> about<00:00:20.070> 25

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
my plans I suggest that that be about 25

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
my plans I suggest that that be about 25
millimeters<00:00:21.150> long<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.510> 1<00:00:21.750> inch<00:00:22.020> by<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.500> 50

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
millimeters long or 1 inch by about 50

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
millimeters long or 1 inch by about 50
millimeters<00:00:23.519> thick<00:00:23.789> which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.029> roughly<00:00:24.779> 2

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
millimeters thick which is roughly 2

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.960 
millimeters thick which is roughly 2
inches<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.189> always<00:00:26.430> these<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.849> just

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
inches now like always these are just

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
inches now like always these are just
guidelines<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.050> want<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> make<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
guidelines and if you want to make it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.820 
guidelines and if you want to make it
bigger<00:00:28.949> or<00:00:29.070> smaller<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.619> but<00:00:31.619> just

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
bigger or smaller you can do so but just

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410 
bigger or smaller you can do so but just
keep<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> mind<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.149> fairly

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
keep in mind you do want it to be fairly

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
keep in mind you do want it to be fairly
substantial<00:00:34.110> because<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.590> amount<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
substantial because the amount of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
substantial because the amount of
pressure<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.820> comes<00:00:36.120> from<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.450> trail<00:00:36.630> vise

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
pressure that comes from a trail vise

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.639 
pressure that comes from a trail vise
can<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.879> quite<00:00:39.180> high<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> way<00:00:40.530> I'm

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
can really be quite high now the way I'm

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.020 
can really be quite high now the way I'm
going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.860> cutting<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.280> tenon<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.760> using

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
going to be cutting this tenon is using

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
going to be cutting this tenon is using
my<00:00:42.120> plunge<00:00:42.390> base<00:00:42.600> router<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.680> same<00:00:43.890> jig

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
my plunge base router and the same jig

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.889 
my plunge base router and the same jig
that<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.399> use<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.760> our<00:00:44.879> circular<00:00:45.390> saw<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.780> our

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that we use with our circular saw so our

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.049 
that we use with our circular saw so our
double-sided<00:00:46.260> fence<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.520> first<00:00:47.789> line<00:00:48.000> here

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
double-sided fence this first line here

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.970 
double-sided fence this first line here
just<00:00:48.660> shows<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> depth<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> tenon<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just shows the depth of the tenon so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.260 
just shows the depth of the tenon so
that's<00:00:50.160> where<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.489> want<00:00:50.579> our<00:00:50.700> router<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that's where we want our router bit to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420 
that's where we want our router bit to
be<00:00:51.480> cutting<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> second<00:00:53.010> line<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
be cutting to now the second line is the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
be cutting to now the second line is the
offset<00:00:54.000> between<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> edge<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.050> router<00:00:55.410> bit

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
offset between the edge of my router bit

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.420 
offset between the edge of my router bit
and<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.640> base<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.210> router<00:00:57.500> now<00:00:58.500> I've<00:00:58.739> used

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and the base of my router now I've used

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
and the base of my router now I've used
my<00:00:59.609> big<00:00:59.820> square<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.960> draw<00:01:01.379> both<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.800> those

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
my big square here to draw both of those

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
my big square here to draw both of those
lines<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> align

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
lines and now I'm just going to align

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.370 
lines and now I'm just going to align
this<00:01:04.170> double<00:01:04.890> sided<00:01:05.070> prints<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> line

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.960 

now<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.530> fairly<00:01:13.799> unlikely<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.729> slab

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
now it's fairly unlikely that your slab

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
now it's fairly unlikely that your slab
is<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> full<00:01:15.900> 90<00:01:16.500> millimeter

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
is going to be a full 90 millimeter

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
is going to be a full 90 millimeter
stick<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.759> plans<00:01:18.030> measurements<00:01:18.689> are

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
stick so the plans measurements are

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
stick so the plans measurements are
definitely<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.530> guideline<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
definitely just a guideline here now we

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.320 
definitely just a guideline here now we
want<00:01:21.570> our<00:01:21.689> tenon<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.229> 50<00:01:22.560> millimeter<00:01:22.920> step

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
want our tenon to be 50 millimeter step

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.410 
want our tenon to be 50 millimeter step
so<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.689> find<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> center<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.470> our<00:01:25.710> slab

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so we just find the center of our slab

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
so we just find the center of our slab
which<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.630> mark<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.220> then<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> center

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
which we mark and then from the center

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.149 
which we mark and then from the center
mark<00:01:30.329> line<00:01:30.600> which<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.960> marked<00:01:31.229> 25<00:01:31.680> millimeters

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
mark line which is marked 25 millimeters

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.510 
mark line which is marked 25 millimeters
up<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.420> line<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.799> where<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.280> set

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
up now this line here is where we set

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:49.760 
up now this line here is where we set
our<00:01:38.670> router<00:01:38.970> bits<00:01:39.270> depth

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.899 

okay<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:50.830> I've<00:01:50.979> cut<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.280> first<00:01:51.520> side<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.760> the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
okay so I've cut the first side of the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.000 
okay so I've cut the first side of the
tenon<00:01:52.210> here<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.630> that's<00:01:53.020> come<00:01:53.290> out<00:01:53.440> really

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
tenon here and that's come out really

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.130 
tenon here and that's come out really
nice<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.580> I've<00:01:55.180> just<00:01:55.360> slipped<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.900> bench

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
nice and I've just slipped the bench

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.270 
nice and I've just slipped the bench
over<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.310> now<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.580> bottom<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.750> facing<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.350> now

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
over so now the bottom is facing up now

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.040 
over so now the bottom is facing up now
with<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.210> jig<00:02:01.509> here<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:01.900> these<00:02:01.990> two

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
with this jig here with these two

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.620 
with this jig here with these two
parallel<00:02:02.590> well<00:02:03.220> fences<00:02:03.790> we<00:02:04.299> don't<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.540> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
parallel well fences we don't have to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.060 
parallel well fences we don't have to
worry<00:02:04.780> about<00:02:04.900> doing<00:02:05.200> any<00:02:05.380> more<00:02:05.590> alignment

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
worry about doing any more alignment

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.279 
worry about doing any more alignment
because<00:02:06.280> well<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.479> already<00:02:07.780> set<00:02:08.020> from<00:02:08.170> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
because well it's already set from the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:30.589 
because well it's already set from the
previous<00:02:08.709> hub

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.149 

okay<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:31.659> our<00:02:31.989> tenon<00:02:32.349> is<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.859> correct

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
okay so our tenon is the correct

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.949 
okay so our tenon is the correct
thickness<00:02:33.310> now<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:33.969> dead-on<00:02:34.209> 50<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
thickness now so it's dead-on 50 so I

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.440 
thickness now so it's dead-on 50 so I
got<00:02:35.140> lucky<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.590> first<00:02:35.620> time<00:02:35.890> around<00:02:36.219> and<00:02:36.489> it's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
got lucky the first time around and it's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.059 
got lucky the first time around and it's
almost<00:02:37.599> finished<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.469> do<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.859> cut

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
almost finished all we have to do is cut

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.520 
almost finished all we have to do is cut
the<00:02:39.219> the<00:02:39.760> short<00:02:40.090> shoulder<00:02:40.750> here<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.349> when<00:02:41.500> we

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the the short shoulder here so when we

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.099 
the the short shoulder here so when we
put<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.069> end<00:02:42.280> cap<00:02:42.519> on<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.420> tenant<00:02:43.810> isn't

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
put the end cap on the tenant isn't

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.899 
put the end cap on the tenant isn't
exposed<00:02:44.530> because<00:02:44.890> we<00:02:45.129> want<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.609> be<00:02:45.640> nice

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
exposed because we want that to be nice

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.199 
exposed because we want that to be nice
and<00:02:46.120> hidden<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.840> all<00:02:46.959> we<00:02:47.079> have<00:02:47.109> to<00:02:47.290> do<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:48.209> from

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
and hidden but all we have to do is from

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.910 
and hidden but all we have to do is from
this<00:02:49.359> shoulder<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.140> shoulder<00:02:50.409> connect

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
this shoulder to this shoulder connect

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
this shoulder to this shoulder connect
the<00:02:51.069> lines<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.629> using<00:02:53.049> something<00:02:53.319> like

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
the lines and then using something like

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.039 
the lines and then using something like
a<00:02:53.829> razor<00:02:54.099> saw<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.120> handsaw<00:02:55.540> with<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> thick

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
a razor saw just a handsaw with a thick

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.490 
a razor saw just a handsaw with a thick
thin<00:02:56.379> curve<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:58.239> sort<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.659> connect<00:02:59.079> from

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
thin curve just sort of connect from

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.440 
thin curve just sort of connect from
this<00:02:59.709> shoulder<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.670> shoulder<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.299> we'll

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
this shoulder to that shoulder so we'll

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.220 
this shoulder to that shoulder so we'll
use<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.659> marking<00:03:02.109> knife<00:03:02.290> mark<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.489> line<00:03:04.230> then

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
use a marking knife mark that line then

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.349 
use a marking knife mark that line then
carefully<00:03:05.709> just<00:03:06.220> cut<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> thickness

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
carefully just cut in to the thickness

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.369 
carefully just cut in to the thickness
of<00:03:07.629> one<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.079> our<00:03:08.169> laminations

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
of one of our laminations

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.990 
of one of our laminations
so<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:11.560> start<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.950> cut<00:03:12.189> line<00:03:12.370> sort<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.819> putting

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
so to start the cut line sort of putting

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.059 
so to start the cut line sort of putting
pressure<00:03:13.329> up<00:03:13.659> against<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.290> blade<00:03:14.530> onto<00:03:14.950> this

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
pressure up against the blade onto this

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.409 
pressure up against the blade onto this
shoulder<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:20.430> at<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.549> same<00:03:21.760> time<00:03:22.090> I'm

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
shoulder and at the same time I'm

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.179 
shoulder and at the same time I'm
watching<00:03:22.629> that<00:03:22.959> line<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:23.590> scribed

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
watching that line that I just scribed

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.099 
watching that line that I just scribed
on<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.549> side<00:03:24.790> here<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.060> making<00:03:25.419> sure<00:03:25.599> that<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
on the side here so making sure that the

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.770 
on the side here so making sure that the
saw<00:03:26.379> is<00:03:26.590> tracking<00:03:27.189> down<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:27.879> line<00:03:30.720> okay<00:03:31.720> so

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
saw is tracking down that line okay so

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.649 
saw is tracking down that line okay so
I've<00:03:32.169> now<00:03:32.470> established<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.639> top<00:03:33.909> cut<00:03:34.299> all<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
I've now established the top cut all the

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.559 
I've now established the top cut all the
way<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.049> lamination<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.010> now<00:03:36.280> I'll<00:03:37.180> start

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
way to that lamination so now I'll start

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.689 
way to that lamination so now I'll start
angling<00:03:37.900> my<00:03:38.139> blade<00:03:38.409> to<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.769> more<00:03:38.949> horizontal

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
angling my blade to be more horizontal

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.219 
angling my blade to be more horizontal
and<00:03:39.909> now<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.209> only<00:03:40.510> really<00:03:40.780> have<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.019> worry

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
and now I only really have to worry

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.520 
and now I only really have to worry
about<00:03:41.349> looking<00:03:41.919> at<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.190> side<00:03:42.489> face<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:43.209> and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
about looking at this side face here and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.809 
about looking at this side face here and
checking<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.739> underside<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.489> I'm<00:03:45.609> not

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
checking the underside that I'm not

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.149 
checking the underside that I'm not
cutting<00:03:46.180> away<00:03:46.599> from<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.260> shoulder<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:54.010> with

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
cutting away from that shoulder so with

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.890 
cutting away from that shoulder so with
a<00:03:54.190> sharp<00:03:54.519> chisel<00:03:54.790> I'm<00:03:55.030> going<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.299> stick<00:03:55.659> it<00:03:55.690> in

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
a sharp chisel I'm going to stick it in

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.050 
a sharp chisel I'm going to stick it in
that<00:03:56.019> loose<00:03:56.620> blue<00:03:57.220> line<00:03:57.459> at<00:03:57.609> least<00:03:57.760> very<00:03:58.000> close

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
that loose blue line at least very close

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:08.399 
that loose blue line at least very close
to<00:03:58.629> it<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.750> then<00:04:01.959> just<00:04:02.109> split<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.620> away<00:04:07.409> okay

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
to it and then just split it away okay

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.409 
to it and then just split it away okay
so<00:04:08.620> it's<00:04:09.010> just<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.340> very<00:04:09.370> slight<00:04:09.909> Ridge<00:04:10.239> in

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
so it's just a very slight Ridge in

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.129 
so it's just a very slight Ridge in
there<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.859> holding<00:04:12.189> our<00:04:12.310> chisel<00:04:12.659> firmly<00:04:13.659> on

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
there so holding our chisel firmly on

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.050 
there so holding our chisel firmly on
the<00:04:14.169> shoulder<00:04:14.889> here<00:04:15.189> which<00:04:15.370> we<00:04:15.519> know<00:04:15.699> is<00:04:15.879> nice

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
the shoulder here which we know is nice

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.270 
the shoulder here which we know is nice
and<00:04:16.269> straight<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.300> cut<00:04:22.479> away<00:04:22.570> now<00:04:23.280> make

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
and straight we just cut away now make

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.950 
and straight we just cut away now make
sure<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.550> don't<00:04:24.639> slide<00:04:24.970> your<00:04:25.479> fingers<00:04:25.840> in

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
sure you don't slide your fingers in

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.050 
sure you don't slide your fingers in
front<00:04:25.990> there<00:04:26.560> because<00:04:26.830> if<00:04:26.979> you<00:04:27.099> slip<00:04:27.400> you'll

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
front there because if you slip you'll

video will be up within a couple of days

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.659 
video will be up within a couple of days
if<00:05:09.079> not<00:05:09.259> hours<00:05:09.469> now<00:05:10.069> that's<00:05:10.279> going<00:05:10.399> to<00:05:10.459> do<00:05:10.579> it

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
if not hours now that's going to do it

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.600 
if not hours now that's going to do it
for<00:05:10.819> this<00:05:10.909> this<00:05:11.539> video<00:05:11.809> so<00:05:12.079> in<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.189> next<00:05:13.339> video

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
for this this video so in the next video

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.549 
for this this video so in the next video
we're<00:05:13.789> actually<00:05:13.909> going<00:05:14.239> to<00:05:14.360> look<00:05:15.079> at<00:05:15.259> cutting

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:15.559 
we're actually going to look at cutting

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.699 
we're actually going to look at cutting
the<00:05:15.829> mortise<00:05:16.159> in<00:05:16.459> the<00:05:17.029> end<00:05:18.019> cap<00:05:18.259> here<00:05:18.559> and

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:18.709 
the mortise in the end cap here and

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.379 
the mortise in the end cap here and
getting<00:05:18.919> that<00:05:19.039> align<00:05:19.369> nicely<00:05:19.579> so<00:05:20.089> we'll<00:05:20.269> be

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
getting that align nicely so we'll be

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.399 
getting that align nicely so we'll be
using<00:05:20.599> just<00:05:21.079> Forstner<00:05:21.919> bits<00:05:22.129> chisels<00:05:22.969> and<00:05:23.409> if

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
using just Forstner bits chisels and if

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.019 
using just Forstner bits chisels and if
you<00:05:24.739> have<00:05:24.889> a<00:05:24.919> drill<00:05:25.219> press<00:05:25.249> a<00:05:25.699> drill<00:05:25.999> press

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.029 
you have a drill press a drill press

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.029 
you have a drill press a drill press
into<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.509> perfect<00:05:26.719> solution<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.439> if<00:05:27.619> not<00:05:27.829> you

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
into the perfect solution but if not you

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.989 
into the perfect solution but if not you
can<00:05:28.279> do<00:05:28.519> it<00:05:28.669> using<00:05:28.879> a<00:05:29.089> hand<00:05:29.329> drill<00:05:29.419> as<00:05:29.659> well<00:05:29.869> so

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
can do it using a hand drill as well so

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.329 
can do it using a hand drill as well so
so<00:05:31.999> far<00:05:32.239> I<00:05:32.509> hope<00:05:32.869> that<00:05:33.169> this<00:05:33.319> has<00:05:33.769> been<00:05:33.949> fairly

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:34.339 
so far I hope that this has been fairly

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.279 
so far I hope that this has been fairly
easy<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.819> follow<00:05:35.119> along<00:05:35.329> with<00:05:35.539> because<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.259> is

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
easy to follow along with because it is

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.439 
easy to follow along with because it is
a<00:05:36.409> simple<00:05:36.860> build<00:05:37.069> it's<00:05:37.819> just<00:05:37.999> a<00:05:38.089> bit<00:05:38.209> daunting

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
a simple build it's just a bit daunting

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.600 
a simple build it's just a bit daunting
because<00:05:38.959> of<00:05:39.079> the<00:05:39.169> size<00:05:39.439> of<00:05:39.619> it<00:05:39.769> I've<00:05:40.099> decided

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
because of the size of it I've decided

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.819 
because of the size of it I've decided
for<00:05:40.969> this<00:05:41.179> workbench<00:05:41.599> video<00:05:41.989> series<00:05:42.679> I'm

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:42.829 
for this workbench video series I'm

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:45.189 
for this workbench video series I'm
going<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.039> be<00:05:43.159> doing<00:05:43.279> through<00:05:44.029> three<00:05:44.809> videos<00:05:45.169> a

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
going to be doing through three videos a

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.350 
going to be doing through three videos a
week<00:05:45.379> which<00:05:45.769> are<00:05:45.949> a<00:05:45.979> lot<00:05:46.249> shorter<00:05:46.549> only<00:05:47.089> five

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
week which are a lot shorter only five

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.989 
week which are a lot shorter only five
to<00:05:47.719> seven<00:05:48.169> minutes<00:05:48.399> now<00:05:49.399> the<00:05:49.459> reason<00:05:49.909> I've

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
to seven minutes now the reason I've

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.239 
to seven minutes now the reason I've
chosen<00:05:50.029> to<00:05:50.449> do<00:05:50.599> that<00:05:50.629> is<00:05:51.199> because<00:05:51.589> there's<00:05:52.189> so

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249 
chosen to do that is because there's so

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.489 
chosen to do that is because there's so
much<00:05:52.579> information<00:05:52.819> being<00:05:53.659> put<00:05:54.019> out<00:05:54.050> in<00:05:54.409> these

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:54.499 
much information being put out in these

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.309 
much information being put out in these
videos<00:05:54.919> if<00:05:55.069> I<00:05:55.189> make<00:05:55.369> it<00:05:55.399> any<00:05:55.610> longer<00:05:56.319> it's

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
videos if I make it any longer it's

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.919 
videos if I make it any longer it's
going<00:05:57.499> to<00:05:57.559> be<00:05:57.679> incredibly<00:05:58.659> boring

00:05:59.919 --> 00:05:59.929 
going to be incredibly boring

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:02.609 
going to be incredibly boring
I<00:06:00.199> dare<00:06:00.439> say<00:06:00.619> and<00:06:01.159> there's<00:06:01.639> not<00:06:01.849> going<00:06:01.999> to<00:06:02.059> be<00:06:02.119> I

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:02.619 
I dare say and there's not going to be I

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.299 
I dare say and there's not going to be I
don't<00:06:03.619> think<00:06:03.769> a<00:06:03.800> lot<00:06:03.919> of<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.159> would<00:06:04.279> actually

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:04.309 
don't think a lot of you would actually

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.009 
don't think a lot of you would actually
make<00:06:04.789> it<00:06:04.969> through<00:06:05.179> to<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.329> very<00:06:05.419> end<00:06:05.659> so

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:06.019 
make it through to the very end so

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.790 
make it through to the very end so
you're<00:06:06.139> going<00:06:06.259> to<00:06:06.289> be<00:06:06.409> getting<00:06:06.619> the<00:06:06.769> same

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
you're going to be getting the same

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.339 
you're going to be getting the same
amount<00:06:07.099> of<00:06:07.369> content<00:06:07.849> just<00:06:08.239> in<00:06:08.539> two<00:06:09.199> to<00:06:09.319> three

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
amount of content just in two to three

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.909 
amount of content just in two to three
shorter<00:06:09.919> videos<00:06:10.249> every<00:06:10.639> week<00:06:11.349> that<00:06:12.349> said<00:06:12.619> some

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
shorter videos every week that said some

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.859 
shorter videos every week that said some
weeks<00:06:13.129> I<00:06:13.339> might<00:06:13.639> not<00:06:13.789> be<00:06:13.909> able<00:06:14.029> to<00:06:14.089> get<00:06:14.299> a<00:06:14.479> full

three videos out so you might only see

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.179 
three videos out so you might only see
one<00:06:17.829> but<00:06:18.829> I'm<00:06:19.009> aiming<00:06:19.639> for<00:06:19.669> three<00:06:20.089> so
