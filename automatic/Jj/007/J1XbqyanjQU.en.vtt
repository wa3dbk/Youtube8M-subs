pretty like referential to the audience

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
pretty like referential to the audience
like<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.270> test<00:01:24.570> screenings

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
like we we do a lot of test screenings

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.990 
like we we do a lot of test screenings
we<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.530> listen<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.549> laugh<00:01:26.759> at

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
we really listen to what they laugh at

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
we really listen to what they laugh at
and<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.130> there's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.220> lot<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and what they don't and there's a lot of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.249 
and what they don't and there's a lot of
jokes<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.030> personally<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:31.079> are

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
jokes that I personally think are

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.899 
jokes that I personally think are
hilarious<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:31.950> no<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> audience

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
hilarious but no one in the audience

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.080 
hilarious but no one in the audience
seems<00:01:33.740> pretty<00:01:34.740> hard<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> case<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.820> keep

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
seems pretty hard to make a case to keep

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
seems pretty hard to make a case to keep
them<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> movie<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.710> you're
