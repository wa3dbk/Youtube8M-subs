00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
was a week and a half ago tip one run

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.520 
was a week and a half ago tip one run
and<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.690> remembered<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.170> I've<00:02:26.350> actually

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
and then I remembered that I've actually

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.550 
and then I remembered that I've actually
got<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.160> tracker<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.150> my<00:02:28.420> phone<00:02:28.690> I've<00:02:29.320> got<00:02:29.350> an

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
got a tracker on my phone I've got an

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.750 
got a tracker on my phone I've got an
HTC<00:02:30.190> Android<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:33.100> tracking<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.580> pretty

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
HTC Android and the tracking is pretty

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.310 
HTC Android and the tracking is pretty
cool<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.750> really<00:02:34.780> quite<00:02:35.110> good

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
cool in it so it's really quite good

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.250 
cool in it so it's really quite good
just<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:36.150> keep<00:02:37.150> track<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.660> practice<00:02:38.050> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
just to keep track if you practice of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.680 
just to keep track if you practice of
course<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.790> can<00:02:39.940> see<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.540> know<00:02:40.660> how

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
course and so you can see you know how

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.180 
course and so you can see you know how
far<00:02:41.350> you've<00:02:41.470> actually<00:02:41.590> running<00:02:41.890> I've<00:02:41.980> never

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.680 
done that before and it was quite
surprising<00:02:44.800> if<00:02:45.790> any<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.480> followed
