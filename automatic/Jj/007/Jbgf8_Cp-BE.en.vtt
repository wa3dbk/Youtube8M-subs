later<00:02:03.580> right<00:02:04.090> looking<00:02:04.570> forward<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:04.990> as<00:02:05.140> I

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.690 
later right looking forward to that as I
say<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.560> actual<00:02:05.830> frame<00:02:06.160> raised<00:02:06.400> on<00:02:06.580> this

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
say the actual frame raised on this

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.010 
say the actual frame raised on this
might<00:02:06.940> be<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.150> little<00:02:07.240> bit<00:02:07.420> slow<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.840> very

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
might be a little bit slow it is very

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.660 
might be a little bit slow it is very
much<00:02:08.080> an<00:02:08.260> experiment<00:02:08.770> for<00:02:08.920> us<00:02:09.250> for<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.459> first

so<00:04:06.319> it's<00:04:06.500> quite<00:04:06.680> quick<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.099> easy<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.430> use<00:04:07.690> well

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
so it's quite quick and easy to use well

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.930 
so it's quite quick and easy to use well
as<00:04:08.900> even<00:04:09.500> though<00:04:09.650> I've<00:04:09.890> never<00:04:09.920> flown<00:04:10.459> one

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
as even though I've never flown one

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.280 
as even though I've never flown one
before<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.239> think<00:04:11.569> we<00:04:11.750> should<00:04:11.780> have<00:04:12.049> a<00:04:12.079> go<00:04:12.260> at

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
before I think we should have a go at

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.259 
before I think we should have a go at
landing<00:04:12.829> how<00:04:13.370> many<00:04:13.549> miles<00:04:13.700> out<00:04:13.940> are<00:04:14.030> we<00:04:14.060> at<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
landing how many miles out are we at the

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.880 
landing how many miles out are we at the
moment<00:04:14.540> we're<00:04:14.840> currently<00:04:15.079> on<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.349> DMS<00:04:15.739> is

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
moment we're currently on the DMS is

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.949 
moment we're currently on the DMS is
three<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.250> half<00:04:16.280> nautical<00:04:16.850> miles<00:04:17.030> nautical

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
three and a half nautical miles nautical

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.300 
three and a half nautical miles nautical
mile<00:04:18.079> slightly<00:04:18.500> bigger<00:04:18.650> than<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.859> statute

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
mile slightly bigger than the statute

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.240 
mile slightly bigger than the statute
mile<00:04:19.780> it's<00:04:20.780> gonna<00:04:20.900> take<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.169> step<00:04:21.410> out<00:04:21.590> minute

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
mile it's gonna take a step out minute

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.950 
mile it's gonna take a step out minute
in<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.370> bit<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.669> get<00:04:22.789> down<00:04:23.000> from<00:04:23.210> here<00:04:23.300> well

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
in a bit to get down from here well

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.020 
in a bit to get down from here well
let's<00:04:24.500> get<00:04:24.680> going<00:04:24.740> man<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.400> what<00:04:25.580> do<00:04:25.699> I<00:04:25.729> need<00:04:25.850> to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
let's get going man so what do I need to

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.029 
let's get going man so what do I need to
do<00:04:26.270> left<00:04:26.840> hand<00:04:27.080> side<00:04:27.289> of<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.470> runway<00:04:27.620> there

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
do left hand side of the runway there

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.800 
do left hand side of the runway there
are<00:04:28.190> four<00:04:28.430> lights<00:04:28.639> to<00:04:29.000> white<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.570> read

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
are four lights to white and to read

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.050 
are four lights to white and to read
that<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.950> means<00:04:31.100> you're<00:04:31.220> perfectly<00:04:31.760> on<00:04:31.910> the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
that it means you're perfectly on the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.750 
that it means you're perfectly on the
glide<00:04:32.240> slope<00:04:32.270> if<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.710> get<00:04:33.950> too<00:04:34.220> many<00:04:34.520> white

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
glide slope if you get too many white

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.430 
glide slope if you get too many white
lights<00:04:35.030> for<00:04:35.539> white<00:04:35.720> lights<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:36.110> example

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
lights for white lights for example

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.170 
lights for white lights for example
you're<00:04:36.560> too<00:04:36.680> high<00:04:36.889> if<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.490> get<00:04:37.669> too<00:04:37.850> many<00:04:38.000> red

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
you're too high if you get too many red

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.640 
you're too high if you get too many red
lights<00:04:38.240> you're<00:04:38.630> too<00:04:38.780> low<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.229> want<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.470> try

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
lights you're too low so you want to try

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.250 
lights you're too low so you want to try
and<00:04:39.860> keep<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.310> as<00:04:40.669> to-read<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.330> two<00:04:41.479> white<00:04:41.690> you

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
and keep it as to-read and two white you

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.810 
and keep it as to-read and two white you
control<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.740> arrow<00:04:42.889> crown<00:04:43.160> by<00:04:43.340> moving<00:04:43.610> the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
control the arrow crown by moving the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.100 
control the arrow crown by moving the
stick<00:04:44.030> backwards<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.510> forwards<00:04:44.810> this<00:04:44.930> goes

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
stick backwards and forwards this goes

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.260 
stick backwards and forwards this goes
that<00:04:45.289> you<00:04:45.380> go<00:04:45.500> up<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.800> down<00:04:46.010> left<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.150> right

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
that you go up and down left and right

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.320 
that you go up and down left and right
is<00:04:47.780> just<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.200> car<00:04:48.470> there<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:50.000> need<00:04:50.210> to

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
is just like a car there and you need to

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.940 
is just like a car there and you need to
try<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.720> coordinate<00:04:51.169> your<00:04:51.320> turns<00:04:51.590> but<00:04:51.800> we

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
try and coordinate your turns but we

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.409 
try and coordinate your turns but we
won't<00:04:52.160> worry<00:04:52.340> about<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.729> at<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.970> moment<00:04:53.330> where

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
won't worry about this at a moment where

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.120 
won't worry about this at a moment where
we're<00:04:53.599> just<00:04:53.630> see<00:04:54.169> if<00:04:54.229> we<00:04:54.349> can<00:04:54.470> find<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.800> runway

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
we're just see if we can find a runway

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.129 
we're just see if we can find a runway
first<00:04:55.370> show<00:04:55.550> okay<00:04:55.970> let's<00:04:56.270> go<00:04:56.450> for<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.750> then<00:04:56.960> I

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
first show okay let's go for it then I

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.350 
first show okay let's go for it then I
am<00:04:57.410> ready<00:04:57.710> I'm<00:04:58.039> going<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.280> d<00:04:58.490> freeze<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.940> takes

am ready I'm going to d freeze it takes
about<00:04:59.690> three<00:04:59.990> seconds<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.590> sort<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:00.919> live<00:05:01.099> in

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
about three seconds to sort of live in

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.560 
about three seconds to sort of live in
yourself<00:05:01.520> up<00:05:01.669> again<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:03.470> let's<00:05:03.830> hope<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:04.430> don't

can you do on this sort stimulator well
you<00:05:12.110> can<00:05:12.260> do<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.380> complete<00:05:12.770> gambit<00:05:13.370> I'll<00:05:13.700> say<00:05:13.820> a

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
you can do a complete gambit I'll say a

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.060 
you can do a complete gambit I'll say a
whole<00:05:14.090> 40<00:05:14.570> hours<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:14.960> training<00:05:15.139> on<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.830> from
