 the source of the problem lies in the defense 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.239
 but all these forms of artistic manifestation 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.879
 desperate 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.139
 the Chinese initiative

 with more time 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.859
 everybody seems to believe 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.069
 to the municipality 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.310
 using animals for visitation

 - the computer 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.560
 We were at university several years ago. 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.670
 in another condor practical classes with animals per day animations dengue in the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.530
 one, for example, but this has never been the case in all and in all cases. 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.150
 it is possible for teachers to use these animals strictly necessary 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.769
 stop practice classroom demonstrations to show students 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110
 how it works 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.129
 some vital aspects my essence 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.440
 what we are dealing with here in our biological biomedical area 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 veterinary medical genetics 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 are aspects in life 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.439
 this year did not get an injunction in federal court 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.460
 to not attend classes of two disciplines if using kobayashi with 

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.090
 practical activities

 oab wants to guarantee via judicial the right to graduate in a day in the day 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.009
 if you sell animals including the physiological 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.939
 because they like animals on Sunday prison officers have classes with 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 animals killing animals I am very happy with this action has no owner 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.620
 just sets the right announces your law classes

 but had animal rights also eng defending the environment

 he claims that the use of animals is unnecessary computer program 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.390
 who may have alternative methods of learning in both disciplines 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.530
 judicially challenged 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.780
 in animal physiology spirits are used the whole 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.850
 in biochemistry 2 pieces of brain liver that the muscle of brasilia a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.200
 people can not do a year suffered to be manipulated 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 to happen any new purpose 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.199
 if it is not necessary 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:16.009
 this year the two thousand and eleven we have told him with these techniques to 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.299
 be used on the legs 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.749
 the university ensures that it is offering options for teaching and 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:22.679
 evaluation 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.809
 but will appeal the decision of the court at the time that they maintain that they are 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:28.969
 public a part for much love 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.129
 Can generate 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.649
 the jumps to the public university 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:37.649
 importance of the use of animals in both disciplines 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.799
 the teacher warns that some personal computer programs 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.199
 restrictions on use 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.249
 are animations 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:50.529
 not lose all the richness of biological variability we have 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.169
 cartoon 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.639
 they are very good 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.759
 however many of them have a very superficial level only levels like this 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.869
 said Gundogan al 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:06.069
 the second major problem is the slightly better relationship as a rule in 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.609
 foreign language as a rule in English 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.979
 What makes difficult 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:14.369
 in a certain sense, it is a problem that is also didactic-pedagogical 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:18.309
 we are wanting to make the student understand English as is 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.209
 the obvious electronic media the first degree judge granted the injunction 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.999
 recognizing an objection to conscientious objection is a right 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.009
 that guarantees the student to remain faithful to his or her beliefs and 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.329
 convictions 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.849
 this means 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.579
 this for your useful academic life 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.879
 decision is based 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.569
 first in Article 5 of the constitution that ensures such freedom of creation 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.749
 in freedom of belief and is also based on the article dealing with teaching 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.129
 superiority that determines here higher education must seek after it already 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.260
 the university can not be required for the professional to graduate with only one 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.160
 single profile can not be required 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
 world in the future biologist just a way to see the world 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.890
 the album has a way of seeing a specialist is specific you seek 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.660
 preserve the life coast stands for life and feels 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.880
 embarrassed feels bad the highlight is what kind of animal 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:18.349
 the court did not agree with this thesis according to the statute 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.959
 was an interim decision 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.990
 trf has taken the view that different treatment can not be 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.680
 student 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.770
 under penalty of making the educational institution 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.009
 the selective process 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.009
 and the merit will still be judged by the environmental rod 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.979
 next semester roberto will have to attend classes that use guinea pigs he 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.210
 had permission from the university to bring home four radios wanted 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.099
 prepared to make an experience in the university respecting the 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:56.110
 natural dislikes the garbage tite has an apartment by many cards this 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.090
 illustrates why the attitude of the 20-year-old student to the family 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.929
 believes that love of animals must motivate scientific knowledge 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.550
 traders who should 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.080
 it was criticized that after that said bashir decreed the entrepreneur and grandchildren 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.759
 the sheik 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.979
 should be used 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.170
 we education today do not have for the animals that were 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.020
 one of the many people who use the most 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.089
 needs 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.059
 but also by all those other students feel coerced that they 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.020
 politicize more but do not have the courage to 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.000
 ever promising within the university and I do not want to 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.230
 to participate
