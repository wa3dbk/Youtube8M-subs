00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.790 
see them better now you have all of
these<00:00:47.730> buttons<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.360> basically<00:00:49.110> allow

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
these buttons here that basically allow

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
these buttons here that basically allow
you<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.070> test<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> different

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you to test all of the different

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
you to test all of the different
functions<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.840> phone<00:00:51.989> real<00:00:52.320> quickly<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
functions of your phone real quickly you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
functions of your phone real quickly you
know<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> being<00:00:54.510> used

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
know I can kind of see this being used

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
know I can kind of see this being used
like<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.079> instance<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> were<00:00:55.860> maybe

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
like for instance if you were maybe

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.689 
like for instance if you were maybe
gonna<00:00:56.670> buy<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.239> used<00:00:57.570> phone<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:59.070> there

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
gonna buy like a used phone or if there

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.069 
gonna buy like a used phone or if there
was<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.850> some<00:01:00.149> part<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.690> phone<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
was just some part of your phone that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.569 
was just some part of your phone that
you<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.469> wanted<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> was

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you really wanted to know if it was

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
you really wanted to know if it was
actually<00:01:02.910> working<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.629> let's<00:01:04.470> say<00:01:04.619> for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually working well so let's say for

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually working well so let's say for
instance<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> sensor<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:07.110> sensor

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
instance with the sensor the sensor

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.160 
instance with the sensor the sensor
gives<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> whole<00:01:09.020> litany<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
gives you kind of a whole litany of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
gives you kind of a whole litany of
tests<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.799> they're<00:01:11.100> running<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.640> have

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
tests that they're running so you have

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.320 
tests that they're running so you have
an<00:01:12.000> accelerometer<00:01:12.420> proximity<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:15.000> know

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
an accelerometer proximity you know

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940 
an accelerometer proximity you know
light<00:01:15.600> sensors<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.290> everything<00:01:16.350> else<00:01:16.710> like

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
light sensors and everything else like

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
light sensors and everything else like
that<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.229> run<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:19.470> hand

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that so like like if I run my hand

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
that so like like if I run my hand
across<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.280> literally<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.390> vibrates<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
across it literally how it vibrates and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.390 
across it literally how it vibrates and
it<00:01:22.290> changes<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.799> everything<00:01:22.920> else<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
it changes and everything else like that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
it changes and everything else like that
I<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.570> graphs<00:01:24.900> sensors<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> pressure

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I can do graphs sensors can to pressure

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
I can do graphs sensors can to pressure
image<00:01:26.970> test<00:01:27.320> noise<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.590> power<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
image test noise and power and all that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.609 
image test noise and power and all that
kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.549> good<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.380> kind

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
kind of good stuff so it is kind of kind

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.740 
kind of good stuff so it is kind of kind
of<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> neat<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.460> hard<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
of a neat thing not hard to get to you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.179 
of a neat thing not hard to get to you
can<00:01:33.869> check<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.140> front<00:01:34.409> camera<00:01:34.799> your<00:01:34.829> back
