00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.410 
not allow them to get to this serve and
to<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> find<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.680> very<00:02:01.950> useful

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
to me I find that to be a very useful

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.800 
to me I find that to be a very useful
way<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
way to

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.569 
way to
chances<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.079> winning<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.500> point<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:06.159> the

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
chances of winning the point on the

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.600 
chances of winning the point on the
search<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:08.020> will<00:02:08.229> take<00:02:08.619> some<00:02:08.860> practice<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.429> get

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
search so will take some practice to get

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.339 
search so will take some practice to get
this<00:02:09.789> serve<00:02:10.030> down<00:02:10.330> because<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:11.050> difficult

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
this serve down because it's difficult

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.510 
this serve down because it's difficult
to<00:02:11.709> keep<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.040> search<00:02:12.280> low<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.680> fast<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.459> you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
to keep the search low and fast so you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.059 
to keep the search low and fast so you
do<00:02:15.819> need<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.090> practice<00:02:16.300> at<00:02:16.920> contact<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
do need to practice at contact in the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.710 
do need to practice at contact in the
ball<00:02:18.220> at<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> right<00:02:18.400> time<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.540> would

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
ball at the right time what I would

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.309 
ball at the right time what I would
suggest<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.970> try<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.209> contact<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.720> ball<00:02:22.959> as

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
suggest is try and contact the ball as

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.420 
suggest is try and contact the ball as
low<00:02:24.069> as<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.030> contact<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.569> too<00:02:25.690> high

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
low as you can and contact it too high

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.680 
low as you can and contact it too high
the<00:02:27.430> ball<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.670> always<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> jump<00:02:28.420> up<00:02:28.540> too

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the ball is always going to jump up too

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.180 
the ball is always going to jump up too
high<00:02:28.870> off<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.319> survey<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.739> don't<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.099> that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
high off the survey you don't want that

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.530 
high off the survey you don't want that
so<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.400> want<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.670> try<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.940> contact<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.330> ball

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so you want to try and contact the ball

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.160 
so you want to try and contact the ball
really<00:02:31.750> as<00:02:32.560> low<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:34.030> you're<00:02:34.480> comfortable<00:02:34.989> with

and just play around with that until you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.750 
and just play around with that until you
