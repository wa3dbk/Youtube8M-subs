mind very quickly and very often in this
chapter<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:58.039> guess<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:58.579> i<00:01:58.610> guess<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.060> works

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
chapter I guess so i guess it works

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.999 
chapter I guess so i guess it works
fucking<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.229> wasn't<00:02:00.619> done<00:02:00.799> in<00:02:00.920> the

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
fucking but it wasn't done in the

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.279 
fucking but it wasn't done in the
comedic<00:02:01.340> way<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.670> at<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.270> same<00:02:02.570> point<00:02:02.899> of

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
comedic way so at that same point of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.109 
comedic way so at that same point of
time<00:02:03.469> i'm<00:02:03.799> kind<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.369> thinking<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.090> a

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
time i'm kind of thinking that this is a

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.960 
time i'm kind of thinking that this is a
very<00:02:05.329> serious<00:02:05.689> note<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.590> why<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.700> order

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
very serious note so why just order

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.820 
very serious note so why just order
something<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.509> hey<00:02:08.630> here's<00:02:08.899> his<00:02:09.019> name<00:02:09.229> it's

something just hey here's his name it's
whatever<00:02:10.130> right<00:02:10.519> it's<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.390> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
whatever right it's just you know a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.000 
whatever right it's just you know a
small<00:02:11.870> tiny<00:02:12.080> grandpa<00:02:12.500> half<00:02:12.650> with<00:02:12.860> this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
small tiny grandpa half with this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.770

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.270 
chapter it's really nothing big at all
and<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.110> not<00:02:15.260> gonna<00:02:15.470> really<00:02:15.709> affect<00:02:16.069> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and it's not gonna really affect the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.330 
and it's not gonna really affect the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
guy was going through that's why I'm

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.729

like guess what's going through my mind

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.349 
like guess what's going through my mind
right<00:04:20.070> now<00:04:20.220> that's<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.910> first<00:04:21.180> thing<00:04:21.239> that

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
right now that's the first thing that

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.700 
right now that's the first thing that
hit<00:04:21.570> me<00:04:21.600> Dragonforce<00:04:22.290> because<00:04:22.500> when<00:04:22.620> they

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
hit me Dragonforce because when they

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.310 
hit me Dragonforce because when they
enter<00:04:23.010> Dragonforce<00:04:23.670> they<00:04:24.450> become<00:04:25.080> more

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
enter Dragonforce they become more

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.840 
enter Dragonforce they become more
dragon<00:04:25.770> like<00:04:25.890> they're<00:04:26.100> getting<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.460> scales

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
dragon like they're getting the scales

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.510 
dragon like they're getting the scales
and<00:04:27.270> they<00:04:27.660> become<00:04:27.960> more<00:04:28.140> powerful<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.980> things

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
and they become more powerful and things

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.100 
and they become more powerful and things
of<00:04:29.640> that<00:04:29.670> nature<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.480> I'm<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:30.840> maybe

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
of that nature so I'm like maybe

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.430 
of that nature so I'm like maybe
dragonforce<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.400> what<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.690> guy<00:04:33.990> went

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
dragonforce is what this guy went

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.409 
dragonforce is what this guy went
through<00:04:34.530> maybe<00:04:35.220> his<00:04:35.520> dragonforce<00:04:36.180> through

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
through maybe his dragonforce through

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.330 
through maybe his dragonforce through
the<00:04:36.780> fact<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.110> he<00:04:37.260> kept<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:37.710> slang<00:04:38.130> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the fact that he kept on slang and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.040 
the fact that he kept on slang and
slaying<00:04:38.520> more<00:04:38.790> dragon<00:04:39.240> he<00:04:39.330> kept<00:04:39.600> on<00:04:39.750> becoming

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
slaying more dragon he kept on becoming

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.050 
slaying more dragon he kept on becoming
more<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.530> more<00:04:40.680> powerful<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.640> I'm<00:04:41.970> thinking

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
more and more powerful so I'm thinking

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.940 
more and more powerful so I'm thinking
that's<00:04:42.390> probably<00:04:42.840> what<00:04:43.050> happened<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
that's probably what happened and the

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.220 
that's probably what happened and the
more<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.340> more<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.669> use<00:04:45.020> Dragon<00:04:46.020> Slayer

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
more and more you use Dragon Slayer

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.780 
more and more you use Dragon Slayer
magic<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:46.980> more<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.250> more<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.430> become<00:04:47.610> a

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
magic and the more and more you become a

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.550 
magic and the more and more you become a
depth<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.510> more<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.840> more<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.080> master

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
depth of in the more and more you master

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.840 
depth of in the more and more you master
it<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:50.010> course<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.370> more<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.669> more<00:04:50.730> you

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
it and of course the more and more you

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.610 
it and of course the more and more you
master<00:04:51.360> Dragonforce<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.140> more<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.440> more<00:04:52.530> you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
master Dragonforce the more and more you

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.220 
master Dragonforce the more and more you
become<00:04:52.860> like<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.669> man<00:04:54.030> i<00:04:54.060> canna<00:04:54.450> logia<00:04:54.870> so
