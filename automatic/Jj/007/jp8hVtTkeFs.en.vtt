if you know if we can do same thing with
anything<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.630> started<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.110> bloom

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
anything when we started out with bloom

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.869 
anything when we started out with bloom
under<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.980> wouldn't<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.280> us<00:00:38.399> playing<00:00:38.610> live

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
under they wouldn't have us playing live

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.220 
under they wouldn't have us playing live
because<00:00:39.090> bloom<00:00:39.420> only<00:00:39.540> wasn't<00:00:39.840> hiding<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
because bloom only wasn't hiding up in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.869 
because bloom only wasn't hiding up in
the<00:00:40.290> charts<00:00:40.710> when<00:00:41.219> he<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.430> hung<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the charts when he got hung up in the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.049 
the charts when he got hung up in the
charts<00:00:42.530> when<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.620> said<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> liked<00:00:44.430> Latin<00:00:44.789> flavor
