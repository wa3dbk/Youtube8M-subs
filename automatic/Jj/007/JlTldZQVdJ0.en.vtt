over to your press on the film up key so
this<00:03:52.800> other<00:03:52.950> thing<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.490> test<00:03:53.760> such<00:03:54.180> as

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
this other thing you can test such as

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.670 
this other thing you can test such as
infrared<00:03:54.690> left<00:03:55.310> block<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.730> LED<00:03:57.500> backup<00:03:58.500> and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
infrared left block the LED backup and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.640 
infrared left block the LED backup and
blood<00:03:58.890> test<00:03:59.270> so<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.360> can<00:04:00.510> test<00:04:00.690> quad<00:04:01.350> for

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
blood test so you can test quad for

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.190 
blood test so you can test quad for
quite<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.950> number<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.220> things<00:04:02.430> there<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.050> go

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
quite a number of things there so we go

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.760 
quite a number of things there so we go
back<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.690> can<00:04:06.870> also<00:04:07.050> do<00:04:07.440> some<00:04:07.650> other

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
back here you can also do some other

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.280 
back here you can also do some other
tests<00:04:08.130> such<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.370> self-service<00:04:09.270> mode<00:04:09.510> so

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
tests such as self-service mode so

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:18.289 
tests such as self-service mode so
asterisks<00:04:10.970> hash<00:04:12.410> 0<00:04:13.410> 0<00:04:13.800> 1<00:04:14.100> 1<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.650> then<00:04:16.650> hash<00:04:17.299> and

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
asterisks hash 0 0 1 1 and then hash and

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.990 
asterisks hash 0 0 1 1 and then hash and
this<00:04:18.810> will<00:04:19.049> put<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.130> service<00:04:20.640> mode

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
