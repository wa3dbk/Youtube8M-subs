00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.670
 This is nokia x inexpensive smartphone for 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.260
 android application externally with a smartphone 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.120
 all right he's cute and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.250
 memorable and most importantly when you take in 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 hands understand what an inexpensive thing too 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.449
 maybe a quality case is felt 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 solid and monolithic although he understands 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.050
 body material polycarbonate is very 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.700
 pleasant to the touch does not bend 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.110
 and the glass does not crackle even the display is not 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.240
 bend volume key 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.830
 locks are not considered and sit tight 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.390
 in their places too happy even 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.550
 flagship smartphones often cannot 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 boast such a body as nokia x 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.300
 price range in which is 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 nokia x hard to find smartphones &amp; p with 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.020
 4 inch display with 480 resolution 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.759
 800 points 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.160
 I can not say that the screen is excellent but 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.080
 good for sure even viewing angles are big and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.430
 no color inversion when deflected under 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.530
 display only one touch keys 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 clamping back which takes you back 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.250
 home on the back of the camera for 3 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.170
 megapixels without autofocus and without flash 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.759
 in daylight, pictures are obtained 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.530
 quite good light reduction 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.960
 quality drops videos are written in 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.210
 maximum resolution while 480pi 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.890
 the number of available h8 permissions and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.600
 among all these spells I personally 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.729
 I understand only vga headphone jack 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.470
 top to connect micro-usb cable 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.119
 bottom under the cover which is removed 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.520
 the battery is pretty tight 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.289
 1,500 milliampere hours two slots 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.060
 for sim cards and one for memory card 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.500
 the presence of the latter can be very happy 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.490
 put there photos of music and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.289
 other content 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.759
 By the way, the sound of the headphones is very good 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.650
 Especially if you tweak the equalizer 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.810
 player poweramp for themselves and their headphones 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.810
 smartphones work dual-core 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.910
 qualcomm snapdragon 200 m s m 80 225 s 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.459
 clock frequency of 1 hertz and accelerator 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.500
 adreno 203 couple, they even pull many 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.480
 good toys for example asphalt 8 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.310
 RAM 512 megabytes 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.420
 custom 4 gigabyte version 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 operating system 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.410
 here everything is cool as if there is android 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 how could it be no matter what night i 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.950
 I tried to cut as much as possible all that 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.050
 can remind about google google 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.640
 account in settings cannot be added 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.080
 nonetheless contacts and calendar and 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.420
 android users can bring 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.130
 manually through Yandex migration or through 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.660
 official app is available and in 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.250
 store the word in windows phone 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.900
 google smartphones account added 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.060
 no problem and everything is synchronized 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.099
 understandably there is no google play store 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.840
 instead nokia store and index top 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.520
 the latter can be set from 1 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.260
 the application is basically enough in them 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.300
 but they are not always current versions 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.030
 but the output is another market bath ball 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.380
 market in not 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.870
 software is much more and pretty 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.760
 there is even a fresh flappy bird 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.150
 your market is no longer there 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.770
 can 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.569
 official gmail is like google play 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.550
 You can install by downloading about eco but their 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.200
 launch blocked by the system pleases that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.640
 any application can be installed directly 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 with memory card standard interface 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.510
 very much like windows 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.280
 phone 8 it has tiles their size 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.230
 can be changed can be placed widgets and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.940
 create folders true it will all be on 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.680
 one long screen that's not exactly 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.390
 convenient if you like me 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.430
 like you can replace it with another to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 example new standard lunch league 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.269
 the interface has only two windows working 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.350
 table and corporate fast lane both have 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.150
 vertical scrolling 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.830
 with table and everything is clear in the post captivity 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.660
 all recent actions from 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.310
 smartphone in the settings this interface 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.720
 you can customize select application 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.700
 notifications from which will be 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.080
 displayed on the screen and the other in general 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.390
 smartphone hardwar for such a cost 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.069
 very good body so cool 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.660
 just don't want to let go 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.280
 but you have to understand that you are not buying 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.450
 smartphone on android and smartphone on 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.400
 operating system which 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.590
 supports installing applications for 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.000
 android nokia x came out quite good 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.750
 device and sales are only 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.760
 confirm 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.140
 but to those who are already familiar and used to 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.030
 google system will be great 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.320
 play around to install all the juice and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.320
 follow his update
