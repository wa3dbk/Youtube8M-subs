00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
weaknesses and I think the base thing

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.340 
weaknesses and I think the base thing
was<00:00:19.699> was<00:00:20.000> focusing<00:00:20.510> on<00:00:20.630> on<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:20.960> weaknesses

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
and that was being smarter with the ball

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.200 
and that was being smarter with the ball
and<00:00:24.530> getting<00:00:24.560> stronger<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.550> playing<00:00:26.030> more

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210

communicating well and defending as a
you<00:01:10.130> know<00:01:10.219> the<00:01:10.369> unit<00:01:10.639> instead<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:11.259> trying<00:01:12.259> to

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
you know the unit instead of trying to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.800 
you know the unit instead of trying to
do<00:01:12.409> everything<00:01:12.530> individually<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.810> doing

do everything individually and doing

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.289 
do everything individually and doing
things<00:01:14.959> that<00:01:15.280> are<00:01:16.280> harder<00:01:16.700> than<00:01:16.729> they<00:01:17.270> should

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
things that are harder than they should

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.149 
things that are harder than they should
be<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.159> communication<00:01:19.159> has<00:01:19.249> been<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.429> big<00:01:19.609> fee

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
be so communication has been a big fee

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.389 
be so communication has been a big fee
the<00:01:22.119> base<00:01:22.299> thing<00:01:22.539> that<00:01:22.689> they've<00:01:22.840> taught<00:01:23.049> me<00:01:23.079> is

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
the base thing that they've taught me is

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.819 
the base thing that they've taught me is
winning<00:01:24.399> and<00:01:24.520> fighting<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.679> you<00:01:26.679> know

mentality you know you can kind of go

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.929 
mentality you know you can kind of go
out<00:01:32.619> there<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.039> say<00:01:33.399> you're<00:01:33.520> going<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.670> do<00:01:33.819> it

out there and say you're going to do it

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.880 
out there and say you're going to do it
but<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.600> don't<00:01:34.780> really<00:01:34.899> think<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.380> can<00:01:35.560> do<00:01:35.770> it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
but you don't really think you can do it

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.709 
but you don't really think you can do it
or<00:01:36.069> you<00:01:36.280> think<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.579> want<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:36.850> do<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:37.090> it

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
or you think you want to do it it

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.719 
or you think you want to do it it
doesn't<00:01:38.020> mean<00:01:38.109> anything<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.649> just<00:01:38.859> being<00:01:39.609> in<00:01:39.700> a

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
doesn't mean anything so just being in a

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.510 
doesn't mean anything so just being in a
dogfight<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.509> what<00:01:41.140> they've<00:01:41.319> you<00:01:42.159> know<00:01:42.189> taught

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
heart and started to implement that yeah

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.020 
heart and started to implement that yeah
I<00:01:53.109> mean<00:01:53.140> with<00:01:53.379> the<00:01:53.560> six<00:01:54.159> caps<00:01:54.369> obviously<00:01:54.909> you
