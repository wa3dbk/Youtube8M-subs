between a supercross track and a
Nationals<00:00:39.809> track<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.770> cool<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
Nationals track which is pretty cool and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
be a sand track and then he made the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.720 
be a sand track and then he made the
Nationals<00:00:46.050> section<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.739> bit<00:00:46.860> wider<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
Nationals section a little bit wider to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
Nationals section a little bit wider to
help<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.090> passing<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:49.050> necessarily

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
help with passing I don't necessarily

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.569 
help with passing I don't necessarily
think<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.739> needs<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.129> wide<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
think it needs to be as wide as it is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
think it needs to be as wide as it is
but<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:51.960> issue<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.260> all

they go inside yeah that's probably the

they go inside yeah that's probably the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
way to go if you just slow down and hit

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.990

it<00:03:05.930> correctly<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.220> hit<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.490> inside

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
it correctly and you can hit this inside

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.370 
it correctly and you can hit this inside
