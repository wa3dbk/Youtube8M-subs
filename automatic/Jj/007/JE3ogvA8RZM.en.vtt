park I'm going to show you how to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.700 
park I'm going to show you how to
measure<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.589> install<00:00:08.130> insulation<00:00:09.710> typically

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.120 
measure and install insulation typically
there's<00:00:11.400> two<00:00:11.880> widths<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.230> work<00:00:14.099> with

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
there's two widths that we work with

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.430 
there's two widths that we work with
when<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.610> work<00:00:14.759> with<00:00:14.940> insulation<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:16.230> work

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
when we work with insulation we work

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220 
when we work with insulation we work
with<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> 16<00:00:17.190> inch<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.609> center<00:00:17.640> joist<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> 24

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
want to show you the 16 inch on center

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
want to show you the 16 inch on center
floor<00:01:09.869> joists<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.590> standing<00:01:10.890> in

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
floor joists that I'm standing in

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
floor joists that I'm standing in
between<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> floor<00:01:16.259> joist<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
between so this is a floor joist or a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.870 
between so this is a floor joist or a
stud<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.439> if<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.650> put<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:19.920> tape<00:01:20.250> center<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
stud and if I put my tape center of the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
stud and if I put my tape center of the
stud<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.770> measure<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> other<00:01:23.490> side

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
stud and measure over to the other side

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
stud and measure over to the other side
of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> Sun<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.590> says<00:01:25.590> 16<00:01:26.130> inches<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
of the Sun it says 16 inches and so that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.109 
of the Sun it says 16 inches and so that
means<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:32.119> 14-inch

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
means that i actually have a 14-inch

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.380 
means that i actually have a 14-inch
stud<00:01:33.509> Bay<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:35.189> beauty<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.820> ultra<00:01:36.210> touch

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
stud Bay the beauty of this ultra touch

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
stud Bay the beauty of this ultra touch
insulation<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.590> actually<00:01:37.829> 16<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
insulation is that it's actually 16 and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
insulation is that it's actually 16 and
a<00:01:38.820> quarter<00:01:39.000> inches<00:01:39.150> wide<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.560> we'll<00:01:40.829> work<00:01:41.100> on

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
a quarter inches wide so we'll work on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
a quarter inches wide so we'll work on
friction<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.090> unlike<00:01:43.049> other<00:01:43.259> installations

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
friction that unlike other installations

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
friction that unlike other installations
where<00:01:44.610> they're<00:01:45.030> exactly<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> same<00:01:45.720> width<00:01:46.140> as

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
where they're exactly the same width as

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.340 
where they're exactly the same width as
the<00:01:46.320> bay<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.780> I'll<00:01:48.899> mean<00:01:49.140> what

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the bay and this is what I'll mean what

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.580 
the bay and this is what I'll mean what
i<00:01:49.380> mean<00:01:49.649> by<00:01:49.799> friction<00:01:50.250> fit<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:52.140> piece<00:01:52.409> here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
i mean by friction fit this piece here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.080 
i mean by friction fit this piece here
that<00:01:52.680> i<00:01:52.890> already<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.399> installed<00:01:53.579> i

it<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.040> piece

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it is is just a piece

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.710 
it is is just a piece
insulation<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.880> wire<00:02:02.880> in

insulation that you can see is wire in

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.500 
insulation that you can see is wire in
the<00:02:04.440> joists<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.100> they're<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.880> pushed<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.390> up
