00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.050
 the mustachioed plumber arrived 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 to another 3ds title but this time in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.329
 a different version with dozens of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.550
 little marius toads and others 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.660
 toy characters in March in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.660
 donkey kong jungle 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.829
 This is the fifth game in the Mario series. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.530
 verses of the king kong that had its beginning 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 of game boy advance and the first to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.199
 abandon the 2d gameplay to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.539
 to present things in a 3d perspective 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 the main mode your goal is to guide the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 mini mÃ¡rio through a board 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.899
 full of traps and holes 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 using a series of parts that are 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.060
 given randomly and while the screen 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.760
 3ds main shows a 3d version 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 from the board the bottom screen gives you a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 view from above so you do not have 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 It is very difficult when 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.890
 parts 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.930
 however you should think fast since 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.830
 each book has the time limit for 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.350
 be solved 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.590
 in addition the pieces are given 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 automatically 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
 and you can only keep five of them in your 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 inventory at a time 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.800
 if you have a maximum of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.850
 parties and I get teacher is game over in 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.830
 hour 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 this makes the puzzles come 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.979
 challenging 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.680
 since you should be careful with the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.780
 time managing their parts and still 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 take care that the mini Mario does not fall into 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.260
 no trap 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.960
 which can generate some moments of 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.820
 frustration but nothing that prevents you from 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.940
 advance on the ground after some 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940
 attempts 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.649
 besides the main module called miles 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.830
 members there are several others 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.479
 modalities based on the same mechanics 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.060
 but they add more characters 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.950
 wandering the scenario that dare you to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 carry minis across trays 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.840
 much larger 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 all these modes rely on coins that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.590
 can be collected to release 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.170
 extra mini-games that give more 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.600
 varieties a game like daycare club 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.700
 where the goal is to use styling and 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.010
 take a variety of yen against a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.769
 cube to try to break it faster 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.299
 possible 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.019
 despite the change of perspective in the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.540
 camera 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.390
 the 3d effect does not make much difference in 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.970
 gameplay and is only really noticed the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.190
 play the day care club since the notion of 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.400
 depth of 3d helps you to turn 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.400
 best 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.659
 after exhausting all existing modes 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.549
 that should take a long time is still 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.650
 you can use the phase editor to 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.790
 create and share your own 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.769
 puzzle 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 besides being able to lower new challenges 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.829
 created by other players there and not 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.930
 has condos on the move is 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.359
 available exclusively through the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.170
 nintendo shopping for nine dollars and 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.170
