00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
wielded and the vector and all the other
colleges<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> amazing<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.289> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
colleges have it amazing but in this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.799

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a single gun and in my opinion I think

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
a single gun and in my opinion I think
it's<00:01:23.760> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> best<00:01:24.630> SMG<00:01:25.140> s

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it's going to be one of the best SMG s

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.630 
it's going to be one of the best SMG s
in<00:01:25.560> advanced<00:01:25.860> warfare<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:26.370> we're<00:01:26.490> not

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
in advanced warfare now we're not

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.090 
in advanced warfare now we're not
exactly<00:01:27.000> sure<00:01:27.450> yet<00:01:27.480> how<00:01:28.440> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.800> gonna<00:01:28.920> be

implemented into the game you know is it

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.960 
implemented into the game you know is it
gonna<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:30.960> m1<00:01:31.290> Irons<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.850> it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.200 
from the weapon if you don't have it so
I<00:01:46.440> don't<00:01:46.650> really<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:47.010> we<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.760> really<00:01:47.880> know

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
I don't really know we don't really know

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660 
I don't really know we don't really know
it's<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.660> kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> air<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:50.430> also

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's all kind of up in the air now also

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.130 
it's all kind of up in the air now also
there's<00:01:50.970> another<00:01:51.030> thing<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.690> screenshot

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
there's another thing in the screenshot

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
there's another thing in the screenshot
they're<00:01:52.290> adding<00:01:52.650> royalty<00:01:53.280> elite<00:01:53.790> weapon

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
they're adding royalty elite weapon

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.000 
they're adding royalty elite weapon
which<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.480> pretty<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.140> elite<00:01:55.560> weapons

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
which is pretty much like elite weapons

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.580 
which is pretty much like elite weapons
but<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.330> third<00:01:57.660> variant<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.440> it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
but you know like a third variant of it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
but you know like a third variant of it
so<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:58.950> adding<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.370> third<00:01:59.580> elite<00:01:59.910> weapon

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
so it's like adding a third elite weapon

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.540 
so it's like adding a third elite weapon
to<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.450> game<00:02:00.660> or<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.930> new<00:02:01.650> tier<00:02:02.010> of<00:02:02.250> elite

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
to the game or a new tier of elite

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.220 
to the game or a new tier of elite
weapons<00:02:02.910> so<00:02:03.060> even<00:02:03.330> better<00:02:03.570> than<00:02:03.810> elites<00:02:04.080> it's

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
weapons so even better than elites it's

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.470 
weapons so even better than elites it's
gonna<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.440> awesome<00:02:04.620> I'm<00:02:05.190> pumped<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.060> but

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
gonna be awesome I'm pumped for it but

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.270

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
there are also some things we don't know

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.820 
there are also some things we don't know
about<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.789> also<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.599> some<00:02:10.229> people<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.619> been

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
about this also so some people have been

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.289 
about this also so some people have been
speculating<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.670> maybe<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.999> have<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.269> a

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.059 
grand master prestige to get the elite
royalties

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
royalties

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.709 
royalties
since<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.430> kind<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> like<00:02:16.969> you<00:02:17.120> know<00:02:17.239> since

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
since it is kind of like you know since

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.239 
since it is kind of like you know since
grandmaster<00:02:18.260> procedures<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.680> biggest<00:02:19.069> thing

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.249 
grandmaster procedures the biggest thing

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.550 
grandmaster procedures the biggest thing

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
get them from supply jobs like

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.860 
get them from supply jobs like
everything<00:02:37.730> else<00:02:37.849> or<00:02:38.090> what's<00:02:38.269> going<00:02:38.599> on<00:02:38.719> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870

they're<00:02:38.959> also<00:02:39.109> adding<00:02:39.409> a<00:02:39.620> bunch<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:40.040> sack

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
they're also adding a bunch of sack

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.849 
they're also adding a bunch of sack
three<00:02:40.730> single<00:02:41.209> variants<00:02:41.900> into<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> game

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
three single variants into the game

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.830

though<00:02:43.069> single<00:02:43.579> headed<00:02:43.730> one<00:02:44.060> like<00:02:44.359> vector

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
though single headed one like vector

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.239 
though single headed one like vector
versions<00:02:45.230> again<00:02:45.409> they're<00:02:45.530> adding<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.769> bunch<00:02:46.010> of

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:46.249 
versions again they're adding a bunch of

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.250 
versions again they're adding a bunch of
those<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.269> it's<00:02:47.419> pretty<00:02:47.540> much<00:02:47.689> gonna<00:02:47.959> be<00:02:48.019> like

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
those so it's pretty much gonna be like

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
adding the vector to call you the

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.309 
adding the vector to call you the
advance<00:02:53.120> work<00:02:53.329> which<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.689> awesome<00:02:54.230> because

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
advance work which is awesome because

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.470 
advance work which is awesome because
the<00:02:54.530> vector<00:02:54.680> was<00:02:54.949> great<00:02:55.250> love<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:56.030> gun<00:02:56.209> adapt

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
the vector was great love that gun adapt

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.300 
the vector was great love that gun adapt
ten<00:02:56.719> out<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.870> ten<00:02:57.049> with<00:02:57.230> Bing<00:02:57.469> and<00:02:58.159> they're
