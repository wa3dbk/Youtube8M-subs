00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.290
 but this we can get at the very 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.150
 ordinary smartphone that install 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.950
 special applications 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.849
 world about the price of gas with the leading edge of g 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.759
 skype weaver application 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.029
 Nothing except the Rada 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.869
 there is also a t d 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.859
 opinion see 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.739
 plain completely standard 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.390
 provisions is a little Boyle 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 several channels are so disappointing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580
 revenues in the country ie program 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 transfer available 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.439
 just not 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.149
 can open 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.000
 look at a few days 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.210
 instead of three times higher class than 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.040
 faster your channel the faster it and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.330
 happens 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
 how much is included is not always happening 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.250
 because when 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.000
 you can keep reminding yourself 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 in this way 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 what was 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 but the second is returning 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.329
 instead we can release the channel on 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.960
 viewing 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.290
 so west 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.520
 before the match 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.620
 interfax 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.530
 yes there are a few points to draw yet 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 shock 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.290
 however, no one expected that with 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.870
 station 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.560
 now the boy is really lower 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.760
 the shoulders 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.250
 this is a return 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.230
 channel failure collapse 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.970
 them a little bit here she is picture in picture 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 actually 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.369
 we want to switch 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.130
 we select the necessary channel click on 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 Majorca products including products 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.620
 come together and apparently too 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.410
 Nalchik if we want 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.020
 6 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.430
 economists low quality 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 20th of June finish is good that speed 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.719
 but only because these are our questions 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.250
 guys are all concierge service 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 I would not say that this complex program 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.830
 in order to master it she came out 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.279
 friend status 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.039
 high speed memory train 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.879
 In principle, nothing complicated this 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.819
 big three mobile operators in three 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.179
 human
