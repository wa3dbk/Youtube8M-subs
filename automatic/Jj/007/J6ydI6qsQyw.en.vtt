i'll<00:00:21.840> make<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.109> spin<00:00:22.380> around<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.980> I'll<00:00:23.100> make<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
i'll make it spin around or I'll make it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.880 
i'll make it spin around or I'll make it
zoom<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.150> I'll<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.140> plainly<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:25.740> it

zoom in or I'll just plainly make it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
zoom in or I'll just plainly make it
move<00:00:26.039> around<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
move around the way I do this is with a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.640 
move around the way I do this is with a
combination<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:29.189> keyframes<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.650> special

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
combination of keyframes and special

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
combination of keyframes and special
built-in<00:00:32.040> effects<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> could<00:00:32.790> find<00:00:32.969> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
built-in effects that you could find in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
built-in effects that you could find in
the<00:00:33.480> inspector<00:00:34.260> tab<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.250> over

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the inspector tab which is right over

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.470 
the inspector tab which is right over
here<00:00:35.610> basically<00:00:35.820> when<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.120> select<00:00:36.300> something

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
here basically when you select something

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.020 
here basically when you select something
you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.410> always<00:00:37.649> hit<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> inspector<00:00:38.489> which

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you can always hit the inspector which

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.670 
you can always hit the inspector which
allows<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.320> theory<00:00:41.190> change<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
allows you to in theory change what the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.029 
allows you to in theory change what the
selected<00:00:43.680> item<00:00:43.910> has<00:00:44.910> options<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.950> do

gonna<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.630> ahead<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.869> drag<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> full

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
gonna go ahead and drag it out to full

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.080 
gonna go ahead and drag it out to full
length<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.240> clip<00:01:49.640> I'm<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
length of the clip I'm also going to be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
length of the clip I'm also going to be
muting<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> clip<00:01:51.960> entirely<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.310> doesn't

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
muting the clip entirely so it doesn't

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.530 
muting the clip entirely so it doesn't
bother<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.909> guys<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> background<00:01:55.490> so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
bother you guys in the background so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.609 
bother you guys in the background so
basically<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> text

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
basically now that we have this text

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.050 
basically now that we have this text
here<00:01:58.740> I'm<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> letting<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.640> render<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
here I'm kind of letting it render in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
here I'm kind of letting it render in
Mel<00:02:00.270> how<00:02:00.719> long<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.079> take<00:02:01.219> well<00:02:02.219> when

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
Mel how long it's gonna take well when

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.920 
Mel how long it's gonna take well when
you<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.939> selected<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you have that selected you can go to the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.730 
you have that selected you can go to the
info<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.770> inspector<00:02:05.430> tab<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:07.380> course<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
info or inspector tab and of course you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
info or inspector tab and of course you
can<00:02:07.890> modify<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> text<00:02:08.700> itself<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.690> add

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
can modify the text itself we can add

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.680 
can modify the text itself we can add
this<00:02:10.410> 80s<00:02:10.950> effect<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.750> make<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> say

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
this 80s effect we can make it say

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.650 
this 80s effect we can make it say
animation<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.210> change<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
animation and we can you know change the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.920 
animation and we can you know change the
size<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.260> bit<00:02:20.180> that's<00:02:21.180> all<00:02:21.420> great<00:02:21.690> um

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
size a little bit that's all great um

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.540 
size a little bit that's all great um
we're<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.220> make<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.400> little

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
we're actually going to make this little

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.600 
we're actually going to make this little
bit<00:02:23.700> smaller<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> uh<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.800> know<00:02:25.830> we're<00:02:26.490> going

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
bit smaller but uh you know we're going

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.430 
bit smaller but uh you know we're going
to<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.790> animating<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.540> what<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.900> takes<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
to be animating and what that takes is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.680 
to be animating and what that takes is
going<00:02:28.800> into<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> video<00:02:29.190> tab<00:02:29.610> now<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> video

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
going into the video tab now the video

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
going into the video tab now the video
tab<00:02:31.080> allows<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.770> do<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.070> couple<00:02:32.430> things<00:02:32.460> not

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
tab allows you to do a couple things not

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.570 
tab allows you to do a couple things not
a<00:02:33.030> lot<00:02:33.350> mainly<00:02:34.350> transformations<00:02:35.340> now

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
a lot mainly transformations now

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.150 
a lot mainly transformations now
transformation<00:02:36.060> or<00:02:36.540> transforming<00:02:37.260> basically

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
transformation or transforming basically

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.560 
transformation or transforming basically
means<00:02:38.400> movement<00:02:39.290> rotation<00:02:40.290> scale<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.640> other

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
means movement rotation scale and other

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.890 
means movement rotation scale and other
forms<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.280> basically<00:02:44.660> transforming<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
forms of basically transforming the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.700 
forms of basically transforming the
physics<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.250> text<00:02:47.970> itself<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
physics of the text itself and not the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.110 
physics of the text itself and not the
arm<00:02:51.590> individual<00:02:52.590> letters<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.910> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
arm individual letters it's kind of a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.670 
arm individual letters it's kind of a
brief<00:02:54.930> but<00:02:55.740> poor<00:02:56.120> explanation<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.720> now<00:02:58.440> we're

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
brief but poor explanation so now we're

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.560 
brief but poor explanation so now we're
going<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:58.920> doing<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.160> key<00:02:59.340> framing<00:02:59.610> which

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
going to be doing is key framing which

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.430 
going to be doing is key framing which
basically<00:03:00.810> means<00:03:00.990> we're<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> be

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
basically means we're going to be

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.490 
basically means we're going to be
selecting<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> text<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.520> then<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.940> course

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
selecting the text and then of course

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.170 
selecting the text and then of course
using<00:03:04.500> our<00:03:04.710> arrow<00:03:05.250> keys<00:03:05.760> which<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.090> guys

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
using our arrow keys which you guys

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.400 
using our arrow keys which you guys
can't<00:03:06.450> see<00:03:06.600> my<00:03:06.720> hands<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.260> probably<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:08.240> keyboard

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
can't see my hands I probably a keyboard

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.990 
can't see my hands I probably a keyboard
camera<00:03:10.410> that'd<00:03:10.710> be<00:03:10.830> pretty<00:03:10.980> cool<00:03:11.100> i'm<00:03:11.400> going

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
camera that'd be pretty cool i'm going

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.160 
camera that'd be pretty cool i'm going
to<00:03:12.060> consider<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> future<00:03:12.840> actually

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
to consider that in the future actually

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.390 
to consider that in the future actually
la<00:03:14.070> ah<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:14.790> use<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.120> key<00:03:15.420> frames

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
la ah so you can use your key frames

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.350 
la ah so you can use your key frames
keyframes<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.760> see<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.120> frames

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
keyframes so you can see the frames

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.930 
keyframes so you can see the frames
rather<00:03:18.690> better<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.740> we're<00:03:20.550> gonna<00:03:20.640> start<00:03:20.850> off

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
rather better and we're gonna start off

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.890 
rather better and we're gonna start off
with<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.060> beginning<00:03:21.300> here<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.690> we're<00:03:21.780> going

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
with the beginning here and we're going

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.440 
with the beginning here and we're going
to<00:03:21.930> go<00:03:22.050> ahead<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.470> click<00:03:23.100> position<00:03:23.880> keyframe

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
to go ahead and click position keyframe

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.900 
to go ahead and click position keyframe
and<00:03:24.959> we're<00:03:25.800> going<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:25.950> position<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
and we're going to position it in the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.270 
and we're going to position it in the
bottom<00:03:27.270> right<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.650> point<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.040> is

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
bottom right the point of this is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.510 
bottom right the point of this is
obviously<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> future<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.310> keep

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
obviously so in the future we can keep

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.150 
obviously so in the future we can keep
it<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.270> general<00:03:33.660> region<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.770> we<00:03:34.860> can<00:03:34.980> keep

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
it in this general region so we can keep

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.350 
it in this general region so we can keep
moving<00:03:36.060> forward<00:03:36.890> key<00:03:37.890> framing<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.520> over<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
moving forward key framing it over and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.130 
moving forward key framing it over and
over<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.320> over<00:03:41.690> it's<00:03:42.690> probably<00:03:42.780> look<00:03:43.080> really

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
over and over it's probably look really

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.170 
over and over it's probably look really
crap<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:43.800> i'm<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.190> going<00:03:44.730> frame<00:03:45.000> by

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
crap because i'm not going frame by

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.030 
crap because i'm not going frame by
frame<00:03:45.209> I've<00:03:45.750> mentioned<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.650> my<00:03:46.920> other

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
frame I've mentioned this in my other

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.550 
frame I've mentioned this in my other
motion<00:03:47.430> tracking<00:03:47.670> tutorial<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.360> should<00:03:48.560> not

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
motion tracking tutorial you should not

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.650 
motion tracking tutorial you should not
get<00:03:49.890> lazy<00:03:50.220> like<00:03:50.610> me<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:51.150> mean<00:03:51.390> I'm<00:03:51.480> obviously

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
get lazy like me I mean I'm obviously

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.050 
get lazy like me I mean I'm obviously
doing<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.200> tutorial<00:03:52.350> some<00:03:52.860> time<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
doing a tutorial some time is of the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.290 
doing a tutorial some time is of the
essence<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.680> should<00:03:55.950> really<00:03:56.640> focus<00:03:56.970> on

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
essence but you should really focus on

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.830 
essence but you should really focus on
making<00:03:57.510> sure<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:58.050> looks<00:03:58.470> perfect<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.840> fact

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
making sure this looks perfect in fact

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.840 
making sure this looks perfect in fact
this<00:04:01.110> probably<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.860> look<00:04:02.040> awful

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
this probably is going to look awful

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.250 
this probably is going to look awful
sort<00:04:03.240> of<00:04:03.300> bounced<00:04:03.510> around<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.990> little<00:04:04.080> bit

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
sort of bounced around a little bit

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.810 
sort of bounced around a little bit
which<00:04:04.770> is<00:04:04.800> cool<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.220> now<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.580> see<00:04:05.730> it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
which is cool but now you can see it

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.760 
which is cool but now you can see it
animates<00:04:06.300> around<00:04:06.660> that's<00:04:07.170> how<00:04:07.320> keyframes

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
animates around that's how keyframes

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.840 
animates around that's how keyframes
work<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:09.080> fact<00:04:10.080> we<00:04:10.260> can<00:04:10.410> keep<00:04:10.590> doing<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.580> over

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
work in fact we can keep doing that over

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.010 
work in fact we can keep doing that over
and<00:04:12.450> over<00:04:13.730> so<00:04:14.730> obviously<00:04:15.510> you're<00:04:15.780> going<00:04:15.959> to

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
and over so obviously you're going to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.510 
and over so obviously you're going to
see<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.230> wiggling<00:04:16.470> around<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:16.950> is<00:04:17.070> cool<00:04:17.280> we

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
see the wiggling around which is cool we

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.010 
see the wiggling around which is cool we
can<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.820> wiggle<00:04:18.150> all<00:04:18.299> over<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.660> place<00:04:18.870> I

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
can have it wiggle all over the place I

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.530 
can have it wiggle all over the place I
mean<00:04:19.140> we<00:04:19.290> can<00:04:19.440> have<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.669> run<00:04:21.060> up<00:04:21.180> here<00:04:21.510> a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
mean we can have it like run up here a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.770 
mean we can have it like run up here a
little<00:04:21.720> bit<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.520> can<00:04:23.640> have<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.660> know

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
little bit you can have it you know

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.030 
little bit you can have it you know
touch<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.260> Sun

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
touch the Sun

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.770 
touch the Sun
you<00:04:27.310> can<00:04:27.460> also<00:04:27.640> have<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:29.730> move<00:04:30.730> back<00:04:30.970> down<00:04:31.000> and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
you can also have it move back down and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.310 
you can also have it move back down and
then<00:04:31.840> another<00:04:32.590> thing<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.920> can<00:04:33.010> do<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:34.290> we<00:04:35.290> can

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
then another thing you can do is we can

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.400 
then another thing you can do is we can
keyframe<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.400> rotation<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.360> also<00:04:38.170> move<00:04:38.290> this

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
keyframe the rotation and also move this

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:48.300 
keyframe the rotation and also move this
down<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.840> then<00:04:41.700> have<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:43.380> rotate<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:47.310> little

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
down and then have it rotate a little

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.430 
down and then have it rotate a little
bit<00:04:48.820> I'll<00:04:49.390> start<00:04:50.110> let's<00:04:50.350> go<00:04:50.530> here<00:04:52.230> let's<00:04:53.230> go

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
bit I'll start let's go here let's go

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.330 
bit I'll start let's go here let's go
here<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:55.500> then<00:04:56.500> like<00:04:56.770> right<00:04:57.070> about<00:04:57.280> here

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
here and then like right about here

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.890 
here and then like right about here
let's<00:04:57.820> like<00:04:58.000> whip<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.420> up<00:04:58.540> and<00:05:00.540> then<00:05:01.540> bring<00:05:01.780> it

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
let's like whip it up and then bring it

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.530 
let's like whip it up and then bring it
back<00:05:02.080> down<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.680> zero<00:05:04.680> leave<00:05:05.680> yes<00:05:05.980> okay<00:05:06.730> so<00:05:07.480> now

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
back down to zero leave yes okay so now

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.820 
back down to zero leave yes okay so now
let's<00:05:07.570> see<00:05:07.780> how<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:07.960> looks<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.530> kind<00:05:08.770> of

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
let's see how this looks it kind of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.300 
let's see how this looks it kind of
Wiggles<00:05:09.220> around<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:10.690> moves<00:05:11.530> up<00:05:11.740> really<00:05:11.980> quick

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
Wiggles around it moves up really quick

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.610 
Wiggles around it moves up really quick
goes<00:05:12.700> up<00:05:12.910> there<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.420> Wiggles<00:05:13.840> around<00:05:13.960> all<00:05:14.500> this

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
goes up there it Wiggles around all this

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.800 
goes up there it Wiggles around all this
cool<00:05:14.830> stuff<00:05:15.240> basically<00:05:16.240> this<00:05:16.450> is<00:05:16.510> how<00:05:16.750> you

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
cool stuff basically this is how you

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.950 
cool stuff basically this is how you
animate<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.560> in<00:05:17.680> motion<00:05:18.430> around<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.690> can<00:05:19.840> also

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
animate it in motion around you can also

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.370 
animate it in motion around you can also
change<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.530> scale<00:05:21.720> which<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.870> didn't<00:05:23.050> show<00:05:23.230> at

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
change the scale which I didn't show at

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.350 
change the scale which I didn't show at
all<00:05:23.530> but<00:05:23.920> you<00:05:24.100> can<00:05:24.250> do<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.520> too<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:25.060> can<00:05:25.180> have

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
all but you can do that too you can have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.830 
all but you can do that too you can have
it<00:05:25.510> like<00:05:25.660> get<00:05:26.440> bigger<00:05:27.900> then<00:05:28.900> get<00:05:29.170> smaller<00:05:30.840> then

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
it like get bigger then get smaller then

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.890 
it like get bigger then get smaller then
get<00:05:32.110> bigger<00:05:32.410> again<00:05:33.330> so<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.420> can<00:05:34.510> see<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.780> kind

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
get bigger again so you can see it kind

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.420 
get bigger again so you can see it kind
of<00:05:35.020> do<00:05:35.110> that<00:05:35.290> so<00:05:35.860> if<00:05:35.920> you<00:05:35.980> ever<00:05:36.070> see<00:05:36.250> people

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
of do that so if you ever see people

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.040 
of do that so if you ever see people
have<00:05:36.700> like<00:05:36.880> text<00:05:37.240> swinging<00:05:37.600> around<00:05:37.780> it's<00:05:37.990> like

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
have like text swinging around it's like

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.500 
have like text swinging around it's like
that<00:05:38.320> like<00:05:38.560> basically<00:05:38.950> in<00:05:39.330> we<00:05:40.330> call

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
that like basically in we call

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.880 
that like basically in we call
typographies<00:05:41.230> which<00:05:41.410> I've<00:05:41.560> done<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.860> my

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
typographies which I've done in my

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.770 
typographies which I've done in my
videos<00:05:42.220> before<00:05:42.370> this<00:05:43.090> is<00:05:43.240> how<00:05:43.330> they<00:05:43.480> do<00:05:43.540> it

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
videos before this is how they do it

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.540 
videos before this is how they do it
it's<00:05:44.020> basically<00:05:44.320> key<00:05:44.530> framing<00:05:44.890> and<00:05:45.250> making<00:05:45.490> a

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
it's basically key framing and making a

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.920 
it's basically key framing and making a
move<00:05:45.700> around<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:46.000> do<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.240> ever<00:05:46.420> you<00:05:46.630> want<00:05:46.840> with

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
move around you do to ever you want with

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.390 
move around you do to ever you want with
these<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.170> cell<00:05:47.350> you<00:05:47.440> make<00:05:47.560> intro<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.100> if<00:05:48.310> you

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
these the cell you make intro so if you

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.040 
these the cell you make intro so if you
ever<00:05:48.460> seen<00:05:48.670> intros<00:05:49.090> or<00:05:49.300> text<00:05:49.630> flies<00:05:49.840> around

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
ever seen intros or text flies around

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.920 
ever seen intros or text flies around
this<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.890> how<00:05:50.980> you<00:05:51.040> do<00:05:51.160> it<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:52.060> this<00:05:52.690> can<00:05:52.870> be

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
this is how you do it and this can be

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.210

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.580 
come Center two ends which is kind of
cool<00:06:32.440> give<00:06:33.400> it<00:06:33.580> a<00:06:33.640> variance<00:06:34.180> you<00:06:35.169> change<00:06:35.470> the

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
cool give it a variance you change the

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.320 
cool give it a variance you change the
duration<00:06:35.919> make<00:06:36.340> it<00:06:36.490> quicker<00:06:36.730> let's<00:06:37.180> make<00:06:37.270> it

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
duration make it quicker let's make it

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.770 
duration make it quicker let's make it
slower<00:06:37.660> I<00:06:38.070> change<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.190> out<00:06:39.370> opacity

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
slower I change the out opacity

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.140 
slower I change the out opacity
down<00:06:41.170> a<00:06:41.200> bit<00:06:41.590> you<00:06:42.190> change<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:42.580> out<00:06:42.700> scale<00:06:43.120> a

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
down a bit you change the out scale a

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.510 
down a bit you change the out scale a
bit<00:06:43.540> change<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:44.260> out<00:06:44.380> tracking<00:06:44.680> all<00:06:45.160> these

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
bit change the out tracking all these

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.700 
bit change the out tracking all these
things<00:06:45.760> are<00:06:45.880> easy<00:06:46.450> to<00:06:46.630> play<00:06:46.810> around<00:06:47.020> with<00:06:47.290> the

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
things are easy to play around with the

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.750 
things are easy to play around with the
reason<00:06:47.920> why<00:06:47.980> I'm<00:06:48.100> just<00:06:48.250> kind<00:06:48.400> of<00:06:48.430> clicking

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
reason why I'm just kind of clicking

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.480 
reason why I'm just kind of clicking
these<00:06:48.880> randomly<00:06:49.360> so<00:06:50.110> you<00:06:50.200> can<00:06:50.320> see<00:06:50.470> a<00:06:50.500> variety

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
these randomly so you can see a variety

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.879 
these randomly so you can see a variety
of<00:06:51.520> things<00:06:51.850> as<00:06:52.210> you<00:06:53.110> can<00:06:53.200> see<00:06:53.320> this<00:06:53.440> thing<00:06:53.650> here

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
of things as you can see this thing here

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.320 
of things as you can see this thing here
which<00:06:54.070> kind<00:06:54.340> of<00:06:54.400> zooms<00:06:54.669> it<00:06:54.820> in<00:06:54.940> let's<00:06:55.180> actually

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
which kind of zooms it in let's actually

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.060 
which kind of zooms it in let's actually
turn<00:06:55.630> it<00:06:55.780> up<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.080> scale<00:06:56.380> a<00:06:56.410> bit<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:56.919> you<00:06:56.980> guys

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
turn it up the scale a bit so you guys

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.850 
turn it up the scale a bit so you guys
can<00:06:57.190> see<00:06:57.250> better<00:06:58.320> so<00:06:59.320> you<00:06:59.410> can<00:06:59.500> kind<00:06:59.650> of<00:06:59.680> see

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
can see better so you can kind of see

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.400 
can see better so you can kind of see
kind<00:07:00.070> of<00:07:00.130> like<00:07:00.280> zooms<00:07:00.730> in<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.060> turns<00:07:01.960> a<00:07:02.230> bit

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
kind of like zooms in and turns a bit

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.129 
kind of like zooms in and turns a bit
and<00:07:02.650> the<00:07:03.280> out<00:07:03.430> is<00:07:03.730> a<00:07:03.760> bit<00:07:04.000> random<00:07:04.210> to<00:07:04.630> kind<00:07:05.080> of

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
and the out is a bit random to kind of

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.320 
and the out is a bit random to kind of
does<00:07:05.260> that<00:07:05.290> which<00:07:05.770> is<00:07:05.800> kind<00:07:06.010> of<00:07:06.040> weird<00:07:06.190> and<00:07:07.060> you

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
does that which is kind of weird and you

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.550 
does that which is kind of weird and you
can<00:07:07.450> play<00:07:07.630> around<00:07:07.750> with<00:07:08.020> these<00:07:08.110> things<00:07:08.410> and

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
can play around with these things and

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.170 
can play around with these things and
animated<00:07:09.070> through<00:07:09.220> here<00:07:09.460> I'm<00:07:09.790> not<00:07:09.970> going<00:07:10.120> to

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
animated through here I'm not going to

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.520 
animated through here I'm not going to
show<00:07:10.300> you<00:07:10.360> like<00:07:10.540> anything<00:07:10.750> specific<00:07:11.410> because

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
show you like anything specific because

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.830 
show you like anything specific because
this<00:07:11.680> is<00:07:11.860> very<00:07:11.919> much<00:07:12.430> artistic<00:07:12.910> it's<00:07:13.300> just<00:07:13.660> do

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
this is very much artistic it's just do

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.270 
this is very much artistic it's just do
your<00:07:14.050> own<00:07:14.110> thing<00:07:14.230> figure<00:07:14.830> out<00:07:14.919> what<00:07:15.040> you<00:07:15.130> want

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
your own thing figure out what you want

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.100 
your own thing figure out what you want
to<00:07:15.340> do<00:07:15.460> and<00:07:15.730> it<00:07:16.419> all<00:07:16.570> works<00:07:16.780> you<00:07:16.900> can<00:07:16.990> also

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
to do and it all works you can also

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.710 
to do and it all works you can also
change<00:07:17.320> the<00:07:17.440> scale<00:07:17.830> I<00:07:18.450> don't<00:07:19.450> know<00:07:19.510> if<00:07:19.600> that's

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 
change the scale I don't know if that's

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.420 
change the scale I don't know if that's
going<00:07:19.840> to<00:07:19.900> work<00:07:19.960> I<00:07:20.350> think<00:07:20.680> I<00:07:20.710> just<00:07:20.740> broke<00:07:20.980> it<00:07:21.250> I

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
going to work I think I just broke it I

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.540 
going to work I think I just broke it I
don't<00:07:22.300> even<00:07:22.390> know<00:07:22.570> anyway<00:07:23.380> so<00:07:23.650> yeah<00:07:23.890> that<00:07:24.430> is

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
don't even know anyway so yeah that is

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.440 
don't even know anyway so yeah that is
how<00:07:24.730> you<00:07:24.760> go<00:07:25.330> ahead<00:07:25.630> and<00:07:26.140> do<00:07:27.040> text<00:07:27.970> animation

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
how you go ahead and do text animation

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.350 
how you go ahead and do text animation
for<00:07:28.630> in<00:07:28.900> and<00:07:29.050> out<00:07:29.169> transitions<00:07:29.950> and<00:07:30.310> you<00:07:31.240> can

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
for in and out transitions and you can

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.790 
for in and out transitions and you can
go<00:07:31.480> ahead<00:07:31.570> and<00:07:31.690> mess<00:07:31.870> around<00:07:31.900> with<00:07:32.229> that<00:07:32.380> and

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
go ahead and mess around with that and

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.800 
go ahead and mess around with that and
that's<00:07:33.550> pretty<00:07:33.669> much<00:07:33.760> it<00:07:33.850> for<00:07:33.970> text<00:07:34.360> animation

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810 
that's pretty much it for text animation

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.290 
that's pretty much it for text animation
is<00:07:34.960> moving<00:07:35.440> around<00:07:35.710> having<00:07:36.430> it<00:07:36.520> you<00:07:36.850> know<00:07:36.970> kind

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
is moving around having it you know kind

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.050 
is moving around having it you know kind
of<00:07:37.390> animate<00:07:37.840> in<00:07:37.990> and<00:07:38.260> out<00:07:38.520> and<00:07:39.520> it's<00:07:39.790> really

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.060 
of animate in and out and it's really
