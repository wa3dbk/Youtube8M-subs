00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Nicolas Cret
and I’m in charge of road cycle development at Michelin.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today, we are visiting Michelin’s Ladoux Research and Technology Center.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Behind me, you can see the Silico track

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
where puncture resistance is tested.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I’m sure you’ve all had a flat tire at some time or other.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You may have noticed that tires tend to puncture in two places.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
One is the center of the tread 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the other the sidewall. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The center of the tread is puncture prone because it bears the brunt of the ride

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and is where small stones get trapped and make holes.
The sidewall is susceptible to puncturing when

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The sidewall is susceptible to puncturing when stones get trapped

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
between the tread and the sidewall,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
tearing the casing when they are expelled.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
At Michelin, we work on two factors to reduce the puncture risk.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The first is the material used to reinforce the tire,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
either nylon or aramid fibers,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the second is the tire’s architecture.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
As I was saying earlier on, it is the tread which bears the brunt,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so we systematically apply a protective layer of plies under the tread.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When extra puncture resistance is required,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you can use tires which are reinforced over their full length. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
To validate the techniques we have designed to ensure puncture resistance,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we carry out two types of test to simulate the various impacts.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We pierce the crown of the tire

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
with a variety of different sized punches

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to represent both the small debris

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
you are likely to hit and bigger objects and shards of glass. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In order to be as close as possible
to real-life conditions encountered on the road,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we have a track test using a bike.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We cover the track with lots of small flints then spray it with water.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The reason it is sprayed with water is because

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
water acts as a lubricant and makes it easier for stones to penetrate the tire.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
when you are cycling and it start to rain.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The objects found on the road
are more likely to cause a puncture. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We follow a very precise, well-defined test protocol:

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we first use a reference tire before the start of each test

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to check that the track has not changed since the previous sessions. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
After the test, we have the tires examined in a laboratory,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in order to discover the angle of the cut, its depth 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and find out which combination of materials

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which combination of materials offers the greatest puncture resistance.
