this is a by text tree that was planted
this<00:00:02.580> spring<00:00:02.760> they<00:00:03.330> sprout<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.929> grow<00:00:03.990> like

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
we're going to make it rather into a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.860 
we're going to make it rather into a
bush<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> make<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.120> into<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> tree

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
bush we're going to make it into a tree

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.220 
bush we're going to make it into a tree
form<00:00:10.400> if<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.759> wanted<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> make<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.570> into<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.900> bush

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
form if we wanted to make it into a bush

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.080 
form if we wanted to make it into a bush
we<00:00:13.799> would<00:00:14.040> shear<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.910> top<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:16.220> and<00:00:17.220> leave

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
we would shear the top and and leave

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.359 
we would shear the top and and leave
this<00:00:18.300> lower<00:00:18.600> part<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.170> fill<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
this lower part to fill in so that it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.060 
this lower part to fill in so that it
looks<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.789> bush<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.650> tree

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
looks like a bush but it's really a tree

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
looks like a bush but it's really a tree
so<00:00:23.699> we're<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.060> pick<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> point<00:00:24.720> somewhere

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so we're going to pick a point somewhere

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.120 
I'm going to take this off over here and
that<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:04.500> balance<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.189> better<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:07.130> here

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

thing<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.140> shaped<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.430> looks

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
thing really shaped up so now it looks

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
thing really shaped up so now it looks
like<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.270> lopsided<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.320> way<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860

so I'm going to go over here and take a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.390 
so I'm going to go over here and take a
branch<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.479> point<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.220> got

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
branch and at some point you got you got

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
branch and at some point you got you got
a<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:27.000> pigeon<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.619> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
so what you do is you go through and you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.949 
so what you do is you go through and you
top<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.410> thing<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:15.790> actually<00:02:16.450> popping

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
top this thing not actually popping

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.150 
top this thing not actually popping
that's<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.160> no-no<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.209> I'm<00:02:19.510> doing<00:02:19.540> is

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that's a no-no but all I'm doing is

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.229 
that's a no-no but all I'm doing is
deadheading<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:23.400> when<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.489> do<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.700> it's

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
deadheading it and when you do that it's

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.680 
deadheading it and when you do that it's
going<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.450> send<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.840> signal<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.440> produce<00:02:27.690> once

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
going to send a signal to produce once

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.820 
going to send a signal to produce once
again<00:02:29.550> more<00:02:30.550> flowers<00:02:31.060> now<00:02:32.050> we're<00:02:32.260> doing<00:02:32.470> this

again more flowers now we're doing this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.180 
again more flowers now we're doing this
in<00:02:33.040> early<00:02:33.430> fall<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.230> whether<00:02:35.230> or<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.920> this

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
in early fall and whether or not this

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.960 
in early fall and whether or not this
thing<00:02:36.250> will<00:02:36.780> flower<00:02:37.780> again<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.640> year

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
thing will flower again this year

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.210 
thing will flower again this year
remains<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.140> be<00:02:41.170> seen<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.950> summer

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.949 
remains to be seen it's a summer
blooming<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.330> guessing<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.930> probably

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
blooming so I'm guessing it probably

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.039 
blooming so I'm guessing it probably
won't<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.700> cleans<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.180> up<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:46.569> next<00:02:46.720> year

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
won't but it cleans it up for next year

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.170 
won't but it cleans it up for next year
you<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:48.519> pretty<00:02:49.299> easily<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:52.000> you're

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
you can pretty easily see what you're

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
you can pretty easily see what you're
going<00:02:52.450> after<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:53.230> that's<00:02:53.410> what<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.799> started
