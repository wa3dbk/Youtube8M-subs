then<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> order<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.080> battle<00:02:16.410> cards

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
then we have the order of battle cards

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.510 
then we have the order of battle cards
for<00:02:17.310> every<00:02:17.700> army<00:02:18.140> which<00:02:21.050> also<00:02:22.050> include<00:02:22.920> the

for every army which also include the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.280 
for every army which also include the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
support tables that you're going to be

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.110 
support tables that you're going to be
rolling<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.740> if<00:02:25.950> you're<00:02:26.160> getting<00:02:26.670> support

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
rolling on if you're getting support

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720 
rolling on if you're getting support
troops<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.900> also<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.560> she<00:02:28.800> cheats<00:02:29.220> but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
troops they also have to she cheats but

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.420 
troops they also have to she cheats but

which<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:19.920> put<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> separate<00:03:20.610> bags<00:03:20.850> like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
which I put in the separate bags like

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.050 
which I put in the separate bags like
fire<00:03:21.780> breaking<00:03:22.170> out<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.830> smoke<00:03:23.640> grenades

fire breaking out and smoke grenades

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.720 
fire breaking out and smoke grenades
being<00:03:24.420> drone<00:03:26.420> art<00:03:27.420> why<00:03:27.750> your<00:03:27.960> stuff<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.410> that

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
being drone art why your stuff like that

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.510 
being drone art why your stuff like that
so<00:03:29.990> I'm<00:03:30.990> going<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.350> doing<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.710> very<00:03:32.040> basic

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
so I'm going to be doing a very basic

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.650 
so I'm going to be doing a very basic
region<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.570> i'm<00:03:33.630> going<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.840> go<00:03:33.990> over<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.470> equate

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
region so i'm going to go over to equate

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.490 
region so i'm going to go over to equate
so<00:03:36.660> i'm<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.320> gonna<00:03:37.620> take<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.810> chit<00:03:39.810> hot<00:03:39.990> out<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
so i'm just gonna take a chit hot out of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.840 
so i'm just gonna take a chit hot out of
here<00:03:40.700> which<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.450> think<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.990> took

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
here which one that I think I took

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.120 
here which one that I think I took
lieutenant<00:03:45.290> hunting<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.440> now<00:03:47.630> journal<00:03:48.630> leader

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
lieutenant hunting up now journal leader

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.300 
lieutenant hunting up now journal leader
so<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:51.090> will<00:03:51.240> probably<00:03:51.540> not<00:03:52.170> be<00:03:52.470> able<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.100> see

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so you will probably not be able to see

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.210 
so you will probably not be able to see
this<00:03:53.430> quite<00:03:53.700> well<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:55.130> I'm<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.490> going<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.700> be

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
this quite well so I'm just going to be

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.130 
this quite well so I'm just going to be
explaining<00:03:59.220> what's<00:03:59.580> on<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> chip<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
explaining what's on the chip in the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.820 
explaining what's on the chip in the
bottom<00:04:01.650> left<00:04:02.340> corner<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.450> chip<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.590> get

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
bottom left corner of the chip you get

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.810 
bottom left corner of the chip you get
your<00:04:05.330> firepower<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.190> case<00:04:08.400> he<00:04:08.670> has<00:04:08.790> a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
your firepower so in this case he has a

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.350 
your firepower so in this case he has a
fire<00:04:09.090> power<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.540> one<00:04:10.160> which<00:04:11.160> is<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:12.180> number

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
fire power of one which is the number

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.730 
fire power of one which is the number
that<00:04:12.720> you're<00:04:12.900> going<00:04:13.020> to<00:04:13.080> be<00:04:13.200> adding<00:04:13.380> when

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
that you're going to be adding when

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.680 
that you're going to be adding when
you're<00:04:13.920> taking<00:04:14.220> fire<00:04:14.460> rules<00:04:14.730> against<00:04:15.090> enemies

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
you're taking fire rules against enemies

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.510 
you're taking fire rules against enemies
the<00:04:16.620> second<00:04:17.040> member<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.780> your<00:04:18.780> fire<00:04:19.560> range<00:04:19.950> so

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
the second member is your fire range so

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.260 
the second member is your fire range so
how<00:04:20.760> many<00:04:20.820> squares<00:04:21.540> are<00:04:21.710> exes<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:23.040> can<00:04:23.250> shoot

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
how many squares are exes you can shoot

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.600 
how many squares are exes you can shoot
the<00:04:24.660> third<00:04:24.870> one<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.229> your<00:04:25.410> movement<00:04:25.949> points<00:04:26.160> so

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the third one is your movement points so

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.610 
the third one is your movement points so
he<00:04:26.970> has<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.120> moving<00:04:27.479> point<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.930> six<00:04:28.199> so<00:04:28.349> we<00:04:28.470> could

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
he has a moving point of six so we could

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.680 
he has a moving point of six so we could
move<00:04:28.770> six<00:04:29.490> playing<00:04:29.789> spaces<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.419> if<00:04:30.569> you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
move six playing spaces so if you

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.869 
move six playing spaces so if you
explain<00:04:31.080> plane<00:04:31.620> train<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.430> move<00:04:32.580> 6

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
explain plane train you can move 6

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.390 
explain plane train you can move 6
spaces<00:04:32.909> if<00:04:33.509> you're<00:04:34.020> crossing<00:04:34.590> words<00:04:34.860> or<00:04:35.220> word

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
spaces if you're crossing words or word

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.990 
spaces if you're crossing words or word
costs<00:04:35.970> two<00:04:36.800> fences<00:04:37.800> costs<00:04:38.280> an<00:04:38.430> extra<00:04:38.520> one

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
costs two fences costs an extra one

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
defender most of them are going to be

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.850 
defender most of them are going to be
actions<00:06:51.360> but<00:06:52.170> it<00:06:52.650> will<00:06:52.800> say<00:06:52.980> on<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.220> car<00:06:53.430> so

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
actions but it will say on the car so

actions but it will say on the car so
let's<00:06:55.860> take<00:06:56.040> this<00:06:56.220> for<00:06:56.430> example<00:06:56.460> I<00:06:56.970> don't<00:06:57.180> know

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
let's take this for example I don't know

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.970 
let's take this for example I don't know
if<00:06:57.360> you're<00:06:57.510> going<00:06:57.630> to<00:06:57.690> be<00:06:57.810> able<00:06:57.840> to<00:06:58.140> see<00:06:58.410> it<00:06:58.560> on

if you're going to be able to see it on
the<00:06:59.760> top<00:07:00.240> of<00:07:00.510> the<00:07:00.630> card<00:07:00.900> it's<00:07:01.140> the<00:07:01.620> order<00:07:02.130> you

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
the top of the card it's the order you

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.360 
the top of the card it's the order you
can<00:07:02.580> play<00:07:02.790> in<00:07:03.110> the<00:07:04.110> middle<00:07:04.410> is<00:07:04.590> the<00:07:04.650> actions

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
can play in the middle is the actions

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.920 
can play in the middle is the actions
and<00:07:05.550> the<00:07:05.850> bottom<00:07:06.240> we're<00:07:06.570> going<00:07:06.720> to<00:07:06.780> cover

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
and the bottom we're going to cover

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.120 
and the bottom we're going to cover
later<00:07:07.200> on<00:07:07.530> so<00:07:08.690> if<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:09.870> will<00:07:10.050> play<00:07:10.230> a<00:07:10.260> move<00:07:10.710> order

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
later on so if I will play a move order

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.790 
later on so if I will play a move order
I<00:07:11.370> would<00:07:12.180> play<00:07:12.419> this<00:07:12.870> card<00:07:13.110> in<00:07:13.260> my<00:07:13.350> discard

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
tune and in the same head hex ism you

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.320 
tune and in the same head hex ism you
can<00:07:25.350> ever<00:07:25.500> have<00:07:25.590> more<00:07:26.130> than<00:07:26.310> seven<00:07:26.790> people<00:07:27.150> in

X so if there's a squat and they there's

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.190 
X so if there's a squat and they there's
four<00:07:30.780> people<00:07:31.140> on<00:07:31.320> on<00:07:31.560> the<00:07:32.100> counter<00:07:33.050> you<00:07:34.050> get

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
four people on on the counter you get

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.860 
four people on on the counter you get
the<00:07:34.260> point<00:07:35.000> so<00:07:36.000> we<00:07:36.120> could<00:07:36.300> make<00:07:36.419> more<00:07:36.660> move

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870 
the point so we could make more move

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.710 
the point so we could make more move
this<00:07:37.050> at<00:07:37.350> the<00:07:37.560> same<00:07:37.800> time<00:07:38.100> now<00:07:38.700> I<00:07:39.060> could<00:07:39.480> play

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 
this at the same time now I could play

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.730 
this at the same time now I could play
like<00:07:40.140> here<00:07:40.680> is<00:07:40.890> an<00:07:41.280> action<00:07:41.700> assault<00:07:42.510> fire<00:07:42.810> if<00:07:43.050> i

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
like here is an action assault fire if i

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.159 
like here is an action assault fire if i
move<00:07:44.160> my<00:07:44.220> troops<00:07:44.790> all<00:07:45.000> of<00:07:45.270> my<00:07:45.419> troops<00:07:45.750> if<00:07:45.990> they

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169 
move my troops all of my troops if they

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:50.630 
move my troops all of my troops if they
have<00:07:46.440> a<00:07:46.680> bust<00:07:47.100> I<00:07:47.760> guess<00:07:48.419> 500<00:07:49.050> bucks<00:07:49.979> firepower

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:50.640 
have a bust I guess 500 bucks firepower

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.960 
have a bust I guess 500 bucks firepower
they<00:07:51.330> get<00:07:51.540> to<00:07:51.660> shoot<00:07:51.930> like<00:07:52.200> an<00:07:52.470> assault<00:07:52.830> but

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:55.970 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.490 

this<00:07:56.970> doesn't<00:07:57.450> count<00:07:57.600> as<00:07:57.780> the<00:07:57.900> order<00:07:58.229> because

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 
this doesn't count as the order because

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.610 
this doesn't count as the order because
it's<00:07:58.650> action<00:07:59.130> you<00:07:59.280> have<00:07:59.400> to
