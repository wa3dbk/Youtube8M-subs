00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 so I hope everyone is super 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.339
 ok let's go they can give an account I have the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.350
 hair a little bit lighter and so I 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.389
 changed all flights is not wheat 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.769
 with the idea as yale or as I wanted 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.330
 a little more volume in the hair 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.400
 and also that they gave a little more 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 lit more clearly in things brought me down 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.190
 a little bit the tone and I threw myself 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 The truth is that I really liked it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 less like and not open changing the whole 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.439
 the year and I do not know that I've never liked 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 but in the dark but good I hope that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.720
 I like and taking advantage of this change of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.279
 hair 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 Today I bring you the hair continues 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.949
 that is going to tell you more or less what is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.330
 what I do to take care of him here 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.529
 also the products that I like that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.329
 they are products that I already like 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.620
 enough time and I can already 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.210
 recommend because many of a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 strong experience I'll start with 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.600
 a lot of conditioner that is they have not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.489
 changed has been the same for 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 years and what happens is that he tried other 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.059
 they are fuster they do not convince me as they do 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.680
 these although I want to try some of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.570
 a higher range is talking about their 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.520
 of the ideal of the pique what happens is that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.860
 I like I have such hair titled pro 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.600
 cross repair shampoos this one is going 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 super good because it is not that I repair 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 totally hair but if it leaves me 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.149
 soft it's like I like the smell and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 I like how you clean it and I am you 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.539
 does it think that if you do not buy the same 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 line like that works better then 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.240
 you base conditioner that is of the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.740
 same line though 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.750
 and I do not use it because he used 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.490
 treatments that we can already 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.869
 approving different treatments I do not 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 like to use it every day 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 because I feel that if one marries a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 just treatment like that hair already 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.039
 does not respond the same is to say that there is no 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.899
 just as soft then I try to 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.250
 change it if I have here three or 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.140
 four masks take away I'm going to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 show the first is to establish before the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 compression line and it is a cream 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 white is very simple, look, it's already 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.729
 ending that I like the treatments 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.320
 because they are much thicker and I feel 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.909
 that actually lasts two ends of the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.009
 hair at this time of treatment what 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.390
 I always use after shampoo me what 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.130
 have known as in your while 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.289
 I fall in love and all this and at the end of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 day this is another treatment that 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.860
 love this chocolate they are called 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.479
 chocolate expression this buy it san 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.890
 André San Andrés is an island that there is 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.450
 here in colombia that will not buy 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.490
 too many things because everything is very 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.229
 cheap but see this is a cream that's 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.299
 chocolate and also hydrates all 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.429
 points also played the trouble post 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.509
 so I love to apply it and I have 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.490
 heard that chocolate has 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.840
 smoothing properties then also 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.939
 I love when you want to have hair 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 like super super low bajoncito and if 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.479
 This is not the same every day 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.220
 that alternates it with 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.620
 I really bought it in my last past 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.390
 Usa is the natural macadamia 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.069
 today is a preparation mask 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.780
 intense many people recommend this 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.760
 macadamia line actually in a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.650
 target pardons although I have a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.120
 little expensive for what works 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.099
 obviously if you have super hair 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.410
 soft but of products that make it 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.690
 the same as me successfully is a creampie 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.610
 just like the others like that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.830
 white super special to me it smells 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.840
 like that gel called choline mucus 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.489
 which is like a fruity smell I like 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.750
 quite when I have just painted the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.819
 hair because the hair is enough 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.650
 sensitive I think it's hydrating 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.150
 the tips I know we are changing 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.500
 It is very important but it 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.540
 want to show this mask me the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.920
 He gave it himself and it's keratin and I like it 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.750
 quite because everything has to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.640
 retire as you relax on your horse 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.410
 when you queens same 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.120
 feeling like the brush is sliding 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.590
 floor and only one envelope but I use very 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.060
 little bit and how I do not wash my hair 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.799
 every day I'm going to tell you that 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.540
 then I still have left and I got it 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.920
 use good after washing me the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.750
 hair many times I have very 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.609
 entangled then I also bought this 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.560
 styling cream of the same brand 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.629
 macramé that is called no chango that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.160
 you want 10 knots and it's just like 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.170
 the same formula that moisturizes 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.150
 very many that from macadamia oil 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.890
 and you apply it to you by expressing 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.750
 all the hair you leave a moment 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.000
 as to be absorbed and then you 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.920
 combs and that does serve wonderfully 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.780
 actually that makes my 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 hairstyle because my hair is very thin 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 and there are usually many ways this 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.510
 thing if I recommend it totally because 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.280
 I bought all this in 2006, in case you're 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.320
 interested to break hair 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.790
 lately used this thing that is 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.650
 a vial that he gave me in the rubber 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.960
 de felipe is the cure on this product 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.060
 It's called Jon Illusion and it's a restorer 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.830
 capillary a revitalized speed 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.540
 what that is like a little water that you 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.520
 you apply after getting out of damaging 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.110
 the tips and completely seals your 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.090
 teeth as the hair feels like a 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.650
 Thicker not really know where the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.570
 buy but I thought it was a 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.040
 very very good product and then when 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.630
 we 're going to take out the project you can do 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.610
 the blower and you can see how the tips 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.840
 which are extremely bright here 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.340
 I'm going to leave a closer image 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.260
 because you know where you can 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.730
 buy , I recommend it a lot and 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.040
 for the ends of the hair and I continue 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.540
 hydrating hydrating then use of 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.430
 these two oils on this first day 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.769
 using the many many years obviously in 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.359
 the same jar these organics and is the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.400
 tree or me or flower 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.680
 it is an argan oil this oil is 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.969
 beautiful is perfect for hair that 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.770
 Many people recommend them 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.930
 geographic right after taking me out the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.639
 hair like a droplet between the hands 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.110
 as soon as to warm it up and that 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.120
 but absorb it much better 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.219
 this I explain from means to ends in the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.870
 super bright hair soft and also 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.490
 they smell thirds and I also have to 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.169
 recommend this oil that is much 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.550
 more accessible to people because what 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.699
 can buy in any supermarket 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.229
 and that l'oréal the vile extraordinary oil 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.849
 of this product had a giant boom 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.080
 when it came out because before they did not know 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.879
 oils for hair in 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.620
 supermarkets but now it is equal a 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.150
 oil that brings shine and nutrition 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.099
 to your hair after washing it with 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.509
 stop calling super favorite and also that 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.310
 they also smell super rich if you're in 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.960
 the hair oils are the super 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.400
 I recommend in my morning routine 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.960
 Many of you asked me but 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.759
 as you do not wash your hair all 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.870
 days and every day they go to the gym what 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.520
 what happens is that if we do not talk about 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.729
 Everyday hair gets even more 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.469
 pahud or a lot of frizz is retained the 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.819
 hideous hair gets you on 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.860
 talk every day because it does not stop 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.479
 as natural oils hydrate 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.849
 the hair then obviously in a 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.159
 All messy hair doctor stuck 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.080
 but he used this product which is a 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.729
 shampoo this this dry shampoo it 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.399
 I showed at stake a long time ago what 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.899
 I bought in irene a lime aroma that is 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:32.729
 very cool is simply like a 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.379
 talcum that I applied to the root of my 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.209
 hair when it is dirty I leave it in 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.189
 practical and then the most foreign like that 

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:39.959
 this talc absorbs all the fat that 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.969
 may be in my hair and this is melo 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.889
 combed very well to disappear that 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.779
 touch white and I already have hair is like 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.339
 clean then this super product 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.749
 good when we get up late and not 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.459
 we have time now to wash the 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.020
 hair or for the days that you do not touch them 

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.490
 we wash the hair is also super 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.139
 since good as well as I do myself 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.610
 so many things with heat and then 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.110
 we also have to protect our 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.849
 heat hair so that it does not take us out 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.259
 so fast hairpin so that we do not get 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.699
 break the hair so they do not make us 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.619
 prison in the product that I have for 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.050
 here just recently and is l'Oréal 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.639
 flame blood fly with drive for new 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.379
 projects and there mind is like a first 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.569
 It goes hair before you go to 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.979
 loutre the hair you want to fall with air 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.289
 this product says that it reduces the time 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.659
 of hair drying to protect 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.979
 those of cúper because it smells surprised us 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.809
 very much when I was not going to apply 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.189
 because it 's like an oil then like 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.409
 that you want to apply the means to tips 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.449
 it is an oil landmarks of hair combs 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.949
 this happens to dry the hair and if it reduces 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.929
 the drying time and also how is a 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.399
 oil leaves you bright at night has 

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:34.019
 I do not feel like it intends the 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:35.550
 hair the heat but if it reduces the 

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.289
 drying time then I think it 's a 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.909
 useful product for all those who have 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.860
 a lot of time and they are always there as 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.089
 half an hour that the prisoner hurts them 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.679
 I recommend that you freeze this and 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:45.809
 finally this product that takes away 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:47.309
 many are very familiar then 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:49.289
 as the best heat protector there is 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:51.179
 in the market they are called 13 media markt 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:53.879
 racing and it's a protector that says that 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:55.439
 cares up to 450 fahrenheit the heat of 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.969
 your hair this is a spray that you 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.829
 you apply like 10 centimeters of your 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.389
 comb hair to spread it 

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:02.159
 very well teeth like there is a 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.569
 capita above and your hair is 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.889
 protecting when you pass the 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.509
 instrument of heat and that at the beginning 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.459
 I got scared because it came out a little 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.499
 smoke but worry because it 's like the 

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:12.179
 product burning instead of your hair 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.619
 The only sad thing is that this product does not 

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:14.999
 bring him back to Colombia or 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:17.879
