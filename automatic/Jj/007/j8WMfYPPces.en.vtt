00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
know I was real focused when I was kind

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.450 
know I was real focused when I was kind
of<00:04:27.900> short<00:04:28.080> field<00:04:28.380> made<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.590> funny<00:04:28.860> comment<00:04:29.160> when

and<00:04:34.170> eating<00:04:34.380> bugs<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:34.890> that<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.220> got<00:04:35.370> your

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and eating bugs now that you got your

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.150 
and eating bugs now that you got your
chips<00:04:35.790> up<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.120> know<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:37.260> sometimes<00:04:37.860> it's

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
chips up you know but sometimes it's

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.470 
chips up you know but sometimes it's
almost<00:04:38.370> easier<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.790> play<00:04:38.970> your<00:04:39.090> best<00:04:39.240> when

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
almost easier to play your best when

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.550 
almost easier to play your best when
you're<00:04:39.600> on<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.810> short<00:04:39.990> side<00:04:40.230> because<00:04:40.440> you

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
you're on the short side because you

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.980 
you're on the short side because you
know<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.800> really<00:04:41.190> have<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.300> do<00:04:42.450> something<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
know you really have to do something you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.780 
know you really have to do something you
know<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.380> all<00:04:43.590> or<00:04:43.740> nothing<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> next<00:04:44.460> hands

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
know it's all or nothing the next hands

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.570 
know it's all or nothing the next hands
when<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.120> really<00:04:45.450> need<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.630> focus<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:46.550> what<00:04:47.550> is

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
when you really need to focus on what is

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.060 
when you really need to focus on what is
the<00:04:47.820> key<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.030> short<00:04:48.450> stack<00:04:48.750> play<00:04:49.550> well<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:52.070> lot

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
the key to short stack play well a lot

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.160 
the key to short stack play well a lot
of<00:04:53.100> sorts<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.640> play<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.180> math<00:04:54.420> of<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
of sorts that play is the math of the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.370 
of sorts that play is the math of the
game<00:04:55.410> because<00:04:56.600> just<00:04:57.600> putting<00:04:57.930> someone<00:04:58.140> on<00:04:58.260> a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
game because just putting someone on a

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.580 
game because just putting someone on a
range<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.100> you<00:04:59.190> know<00:04:59.870> knowing<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.050> math<00:05:01.260> of

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
range and you know knowing the math of

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.840 
range and you know knowing the math of
the<00:05:01.710> situation<00:05:02.310> but<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:04.400> think<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.730> know

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
the situation but I think that you know

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.150 
the situation but I think that you know
when<00:05:06.150> you're<00:05:06.300> playing<00:05:06.510> alive<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.230> live

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
when you're playing alive a live

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.010 
when you're playing alive a live

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.990 
tournament in your shorts tag there's a
lot<00:05:10.200> more<00:05:10.230> to<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:10.710> than<00:05:10.830> that<00:05:10.890> really<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.700> just

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
lot more to it than that really so just

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.440 
lot more to it than that really so just
have<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.270> having<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:13.350> read<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.860> know<00:05:14.010> is<00:05:14.520> big
