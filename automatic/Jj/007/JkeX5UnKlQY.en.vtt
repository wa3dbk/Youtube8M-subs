00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.529
 but then nothing more with eating a 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.029

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.489

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.269
 new these fields 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.790
 bad wave is more to be cloudy 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.399
 well finally let's do this sevilla 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.260
 with small is very easy to do 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.300
 They need a little lemon juice 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.220
 we are also going to put a raw fish 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.170
 if you prefer it to be white or 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.369
 It can be blue too if you want salt and 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.640
 pepper and cilantro parsley chile 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:05.810
 serrano picadito chiquito a bit of 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.350
 olive oil juice seasoning oregano 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.960
 the juice of the chilli in vinegar sauce 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:19.240

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.909
 a little cubed tomato a little 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.620
 pickled chilies in cubes 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:32.730
 onion and some two legs and good this 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.300
 It's very cheap to do but because they are 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.640
 nice traditional ingredients and yes 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.790
 they grab a good fish in season 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.940
 it's better because then you buy a fish 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.200
 very good and very fluid and you get more 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.050
 art do not do it good what we're going to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.440
 to do is that we are going to put the fish 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.910
 fresh from the coast 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.160
 I have to find another place 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.300
 for the fish it's a villa at last 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.500
 this fish we are going to put a little bit of 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.500
 salt and pepper 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.860
 and lemon 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.200
 this we are going to let him marinate in the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.959
 refrigerator until it sews with the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.720
 same lemon juice is me here I already have 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.670
 one suffers 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.110
 and I guessed right now I used the eyes 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.790
 Even if you do not have appointments 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.880
 uy was not like that with the pure juice no 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.840
 well as well as well that's how you have to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.840
 stay your little fish 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.830
 already marinated is already cooked 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.599
 cooked is already very good and this is what 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.920
 that we are going to use now we are going to recover 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.099
 this same juice and we are going to 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.530
 take a bowl a little bigger this 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.690
 it's good 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.990
 Y 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.900
 let's put the ceviche here 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.690
 already marinated in a larger bowl 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.320
 remember that fish is a source 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.220
 very good protein are also 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.270
 cholesterol deposits because it is a 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.920
 animal but they are not lean proteins 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.280
 then it 's good we're going to put you in 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.940
 the brown sauce 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.650
 and right now my grandpa would tell me you can not 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:31.680
 and my grandpa elota not if he did not like 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.680
 so it's good but not what we 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 grandchild 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:47.140
 nietita forgive the lady with the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:50.440
 rich truly have understood already I understood 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.110
 let's throw the juice of the chiles 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.510
 in caritas vinegar and we'll catch you 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.310
 my love 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.180
 we are going to put the seasoning juice 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.040
 as well 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.510
 a little bit of raw olive oil 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.490
 can be this extra virgin of 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.670
 preference 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.350
 the herbs we're going to throw the cilantro 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.520
 and the parsley 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.109
 this is the coriander now the parsley 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.780
 let's mix 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.879
 already the finas were brought very finely 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.599
 chopped that I recommend you what 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:29.469
 peal your herbs do not do not grab the 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:31.539
 knife and crush it because that is 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:34.960
 Sometimes in a house we have this bad 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.090
 mania that we grab the pebbles and 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.090
 we put with the knife do the 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.689
 foundations or we'll grab this 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.449
 need not and we grab our 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.250
 these and we started to apply everything like this 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.620
 so the herbs are burned then nothing 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.080
 more try to make it a single 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.689
 filleted although it is a cut already because 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.199
 if they do not burn and that taste that we want 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.449
 that give off the food will die if it is 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.550
 a cut a cut as small as 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.110
 can have patience but not me 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.330
 help 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.120
 and now yes oregano 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.710
 let's put a little chilito 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:22.940
 serrano or habanero 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:28.250
 let's add olives today today today 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.250
 tomatillo that is already chopped into cubes 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.320
 There is more cabin 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.350
 of that for you to eat 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.030
 there is no need 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.030
 Now I'm chicharrón 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:50.240
 condition is rich because it does not have a 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.070
 touch yes with pork rind if the food is 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.240
 Well, we are not going to put chilitos 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:59.060
 vinegar this lg pica pica because they are already 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.670
 several chilitos that we throw and over 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.400
 If you want to put the picking then 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.460
 We put the picking if it is a public scholarship 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.040
 that action is targeted public and 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.550
 the onion that can not be missing in a 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.550
 cebichito 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.260
 and now if you already have already got 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:24.810
 pork rinds already have their toast 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:27.990
 they already have their beer they already have their 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.650
