we all right ah I wore this we've done

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430 
we all right ah I wore this we've done
three<00:00:15.000> videos<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> span<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> 10<00:00:16.170> minutes

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
three videos in the span of 10 minutes

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
three videos in the span of 10 minutes
mm-hmm<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.550> changed<00:00:17.789> shirts<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.449> left

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
mm-hmm have you changed shirts and left

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
mm-hmm have you changed shirts and left
I<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:19.920> my<00:00:20.070> other<00:00:20.189> video<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:20.730> that's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
I just like my other video but that's

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
I just like my other video but that's
the<00:00:21.150> reason<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> because<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the reason is because we have to do a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
the reason is because we have to do a
lot<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.710> videos<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.189> Sunday<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.269> have

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
lot of videos on Sunday so that we have

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.939 
lot of videos on Sunday so that we have
enough<00:00:24.480> backup<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> rest<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> week

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
enough backup for the rest of the week

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
enough backup for the rest of the week
so<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.279> kind<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:26.939> online<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.449> span

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so we kind of do it all online one span

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
so we kind of do it all online one span
so<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.140> wear<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> same<00:00:28.439> shirts<00:00:28.800> don't

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so if we wear the same shirts don't

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.980 
so if we wear the same shirts don't
think<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.789> don't<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> wardrobe<00:00:30.480> no<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
extreme Concordat the problem is we

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.030 
extreme Concordat the problem is we
bought<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.200> gone<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.560> real<00:01:46.740> knows<00:01:46.890> what

bought this out gone out real knows what
I<00:01:47.070> look<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.430> move<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:48.240> bought<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.600> el

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I look like a move we bought this el

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.639 
I look like a move we bought this el
gato<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> USB<00:01:51.140> capture<00:01:52.140> card<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
gato and it is a USB capture card and so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
gato and it is a USB capture card and so
there's<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.009> bit<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.220> lag<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> we

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
there's a little bit of lag on it we

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.899 
there's a little bit of lag on it we
originally<00:01:54.600> intended<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> use<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
originally intended to use this so that

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
originally intended to use this so that
you<00:01:57.090> guys<00:01:57.540> could<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:57.990> dad's<00:01:58.320> perspective<00:01:58.740> but

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you guys could see dad's perspective but

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.020 
you guys could see dad's perspective but
the<00:01:59.579> thing<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> works<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.909> because

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the thing is the way it works is because

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
the thing is the way it works is because
if<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> capture<00:02:03.960> cards<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.680> has

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
if you have to capture cards if one has

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370 
if you have to capture cards if one has
a<00:02:04.920> delay<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.790> other<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.149> doesn't<00:02:06.509> you're

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
a delay and the other one doesn't you're

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.570 
a delay and the other one doesn't you're
never<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> able<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.340> them<00:02:08.459> in

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
never going to be able to get them in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.040 
never going to be able to get them in
sync<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:08.970> each<00:02:09.030> other<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.509> thought<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.899> just

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sync with each other I thought it just

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.999 
sync with each other I thought it just
makes<00:02:10.259> sense

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
makes sense

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
makes sense
it<00:02:11.189> just<00:02:11.370> practical<00:02:11.760> gonna<00:02:11.939> happen<00:02:12.269> something

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it just practical gonna happen something

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.140 
it just practical gonna happen something
we<00:02:13.319> are<00:02:13.530> unable<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.950> use<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:14.909> we're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
we are unable to use this and so we're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.490 
we are unable to use this and so we're
like<00:02:15.269> well<00:02:15.480> what<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.689> heck<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.019> your<00:02:16.200> skin

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
like well what the heck is it your skin

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.649 
like well what the heck is it your skin
is<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.459> basically<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.239> we're<00:02:18.360> doing<00:02:18.390> is

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
