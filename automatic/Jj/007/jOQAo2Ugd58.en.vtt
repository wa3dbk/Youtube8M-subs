hi this is Eric Crawford I've had a lot

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.530 
hi this is Eric Crawford I've had a lot
of<00:00:01.979> people<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.399> Louisville<00:00:02.700> ask<00:00:02.970> me<00:00:03.210> if<00:00:03.419> I

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
of people in Louisville ask me if I

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.210 
of people in Louisville ask me if I
could<00:00:03.600> make<00:00:03.780> any<00:00:04.110> sense<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.830> latest

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
could make any sense of this latest

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.010 
could make any sense of this latest
round<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.700> big<00:00:05.879> E's<00:00:06.029> conference<00:00:06.600> expansion

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
round of big E's conference expansion

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.410 
round of big E's conference expansion
and<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.710> certainly<00:00:08.309> think<00:00:08.639> when<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.179> look<00:00:09.330> at

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
and I certainly think when you look at

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.509 
and I certainly think when you look at
the<00:00:09.540> six<00:00:09.780> existing<00:00:10.349> big<00:00:10.769> E's<00:00:10.920> teams<00:00:11.280> that

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the six existing big E's teams that

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.150 
the six existing big E's teams that
remain<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.690> addition<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> Navy<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.620> Central

remain the addition of Navy and Central

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.259 
remain the addition of Navy and Central
Florida<00:00:14.490> makes<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.790> lot<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> sense

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
Florida makes a lot of sense

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.599 
Florida makes a lot of sense
geographically<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.260> can't<00:00:17.250> say<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> same

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
geographically you can't say the same

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.300 
geographically you can't say the same
thing<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> addition<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.170> Air<00:00:19.619> Force<00:00:20.039> out

SMU in Texas and even Houston stop for a
minute<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.460> take<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> look<00:00:26.970> at<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.210> map<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
minute and take a look at this map the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.019 
minute and take a look at this map the
geography<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.310> doesn't<00:00:29.580> make<00:00:29.699> sense

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
geography of it just doesn't make sense

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.269 
geography of it just doesn't make sense
you<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> consider<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.380> other<00:00:31.740> factors

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you have to consider some other factors

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.209 
you have to consider some other factors
one<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.480> factors<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> location

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
one of the big factors is the location

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
one of the big factors is the location
of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> big<00:00:35.520> 12<00:00:35.790> conference<00:00:35.930> right<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.110> in

Coast Conference wouldn't surprise me in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
Coast Conference wouldn't surprise me in
fact<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> league<00:01:26.549> didn't<00:01:26.880> decide<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> do

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
fact if the league didn't decide to do

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
fact if the league didn't decide to do
the<00:01:27.509> same<00:01:27.720> thing<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.680> Gulf<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> Mexico<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the same thing in the Gulf of Mexico to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.960 
the same thing in the Gulf of Mexico to
prevent<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> big<00:01:30.360> 12<00:01:30.659> escape<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.439> Mexico<00:01:31.970> same

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
prevent a big 12 escape to Mexico same

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
prevent a big 12 escape to Mexico same
thing<00:01:33.270> probably<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> Pacific<00:01:34.409> Southwest

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
thing probably in the Pacific Southwest

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
thing probably in the Pacific Southwest
and<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:36.090> course<00:01:36.329> adding<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> Air<00:01:36.960> Force

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and of course adding the Air Force

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.580 
and of course adding the Air Force
Academy<00:01:37.350> brings<00:01:37.979> plenty<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> air<00:01:38.640> support<00:01:39.590> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Academy brings plenty of air support so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410 
Academy brings plenty of air support so
we<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> look<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.790> picture<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> all
