honest this one is probably just the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.819 
honest this one is probably just the
same<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.810> these<00:01:30.990> two<00:01:31.229> why<00:01:31.380> would<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> waste

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
one interesting thing check this out

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.820 
one interesting thing check this out

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.300 
you would think that means this is made
in<00:03:12.390> 1989<00:03:13.019> cuz<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.500> think<00:03:13.709> that's<00:03:13.859> how<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.040> law

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
in 1989 cuz I think that's how the law

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.710 
in 1989 cuz I think that's how the law
works<00:03:14.519> but<00:03:14.940> here's<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.239> interesting<00:03:15.329> part

look<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:31.069> 1990<00:03:32.069> Konami<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.329> we

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
look at that 1990 Konami so what what we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.210 
look at that 1990 Konami so what what we
see<00:03:33.660> before<00:03:33.870> us<00:03:34.079> really<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:34.769> we're<00:03:34.920> gonna<00:03:35.010> be

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
see before us really if we're gonna be

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.759 
see before us really if we're gonna be
honest<00:03:35.519> with<00:03:35.670> ourselves<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:36.540> proof<00:03:36.989> beyond

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
honest with ourselves is proof beyond

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.280 
honest with ourselves is proof beyond
refute<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:39.120> time<00:03:39.420> travel<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.019> possible

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
refute the time travel is possible

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.680 
refute the time travel is possible
anyway<00:03:41.190> no<00:03:41.370> one<00:03:41.459> cares<00:03:41.790> about<00:03:41.940> mathematics

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
anyway no one cares about mathematics

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.420 
anyway no one cares about mathematics
what<00:03:42.840> we<00:03:42.900> care<00:03:43.109> about<00:03:43.139> is<00:03:43.470> turtle<00:03:43.799> power<00:03:43.980> yeah

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
what we care about is turtle power yeah

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.620 
what we care about is turtle power yeah
and<00:03:44.670> that's<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.910> great<00:03:44.940> thing<00:03:45.209> about<00:03:45.299> turtle

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
and that's a great thing about turtle

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.949 
and that's a great thing about turtle
power

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
power

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.870 
power
there's<00:03:46.290> no<00:03:46.410> math<00:03:46.650> involved<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.280> turtle<00:03:47.579> power

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
there's no math involved in turtle power

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
they were both just one screen that

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.450 
they were both just one screen that
didn't<00:04:32.570> really<00:04:32.810> move<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:33.530> with<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:33.770> one<00:04:34.010> we
