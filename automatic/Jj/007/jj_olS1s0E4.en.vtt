00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.519
 Hello, I am a chronic demand and today we are going 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.410
 to make some bath soaps but they come 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.689
 in the form of gel are very similar to 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.039
 they are very easy to make and 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.270
 ingredients are very easy to 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.090
 find at home the only thing 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.210
 we need is some body soap 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.980
 Liquid can be of any brand 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.190
 we are salt salt with the song for 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.350
 cook and create lectins in their 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.110
 little packages to make gelatin with 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.000
 other extra ingredients are not 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.559
 needed to do it that are ways 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.510
 of decoration we are going to use what is 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.570
 glitter and you can use any 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.219
 plastic toy plus another extra 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 What can you add? Let's do with 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.460
 an essential oil of sando this opens 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 for our mix then we're going to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.660
 start here I have my fret for 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.920
 start this with the little packets of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.440
 big tub is going to open 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.860
 you can do it only with one but with 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.860
 two gives better consistency 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 two 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.000
 are these cream have special for 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.120
 make the end of the flavors do not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 can use gelatin flavor to this 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.710
 mix let's add three quarters of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.630
 water to boiling point I just 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.630
 warm up if not going to do 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.030
 two 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 and we stir very well until we undo the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.600
 grenadine 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.770
 since the grenetine is well dissolved 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:55.369
 we are going to add half a cup of perez yo yo 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.369
 body liquid soap to this mix 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.140
 this jaguar has a little color but 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.490
 If you want, you can add a dye to 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.490
 this vegetable coloring explanation 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.220
 then you already have a little bit of cÃ³rdoba 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.819
 but if they wanted, they could add 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.920
 during metal without any tone 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.900
 also this is the step where we can 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 add a few drops of our oil 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.120
 essential this 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.050
 of the aroma that you prefer we are going to 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 give a few drops 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.780
 but 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.189
 very carefully because we have so 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.189
 the essential oils less is more 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.030
 we keep stirring 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.300
 let's add a teaspoon of salt 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.300
 Salt 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.300
 to the normal one they use to cook 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.260
 and this is the bare as the thickness to 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.260
 our japanese 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.019
 well mixed 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.390
 and now if you 're ready to empty 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.520
 our motorcycles 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.950
 is that I have a silicone mold 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.050
 to use any mobile phone you have and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.130
 especially these 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.130
 I already want 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.950
 let's empty the content 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.370
 I think he wants to make it clear today but 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.340
 at this point is where we're going to start 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.800
 the decorations can then 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.410
 add whatever you want 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.410
 Ibagaza a little bit of some brilliantine 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.629
 They can add you without some toy 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.460
 plastic or whatever they want that is also 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.530
 as a nice detail would be a good 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.110
 way to give something or if they have children 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.919
 given perfect we add it so that the 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.919
 drying time 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:56.030
 we go 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.250
 on issues 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.350
 and stoner we are going to put it to 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.790
 refrigerator and I just put this 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.860
 our molds to the retreat 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.840
 you have to wait how long it can be 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.390
 that begins to congeal as if it were a 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.560
 Normal gelatin does not wait like an average 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.070
 time to see if it is already 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.050
 and 40 return 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.570
 and wait about 20 or 30 minutes for 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.610
 Be sure I got it out of the fridge 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.000
 when it's like this, any Latina 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.000
 can touch 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.780
 completely set but it's very easy 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.780
 to get something like that 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.280
 and remains 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.129
 if you can take them all out and your gel is left 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.729
 of bathroom for body there is no excuse 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.439
 not to bathe he is super rich what 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.509
 they can use it completely like soap 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.360
 normal on your sponge can take a 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.069
 bit 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.080
 and I think it's an excellent choice of 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:01.090
 go back to our bathroom much more 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.090
 fun until then
