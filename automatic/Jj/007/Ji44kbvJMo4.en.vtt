transmitter<00:00:48.920> really<00:00:49.920> good<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.399> actually

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
transmitter really good it's actually

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
transmitter really good it's actually
six<00:00:51.449> hundred<00:00:51.780> mini<00:00:52.440> wat<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:52.980> should<00:00:53.250> get

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
six hundred mini wat so you should get

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
six hundred mini wat so you should get
really<00:00:53.850> nice<00:00:53.969> range<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:57.600> comes<00:00:57.899> with

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
really nice range on that it comes with

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.610 
really nice range on that it comes with
a<00:00:58.590> jst<00:00:59.550> connector<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> end<00:01:00.390> obviously<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a jst connector on the end obviously you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
a jst connector on the end obviously you
can<00:01:01.770> lock<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.949> off<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.609> connect<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
can lock that off you can connect it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
can lock that off you can connect it
straight<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.110> distribution<00:01:04.920> board<00:01:05.430> on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
straight into your distribution board on

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
straight into your distribution board on
your<00:01:06.060> aircraft<00:01:06.860> or<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.100> win<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
your aircraft or you can win it on a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.539 
your aircraft or you can win it on a
separate<00:01:09.030> battery<00:01:09.210> entirely<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.549> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
separate battery entirely up to you it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
separate battery entirely up to you it's
then<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> power<00:01:13.430> video<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> ground<00:01:15.090> on

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
then got the power video and ground on

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890 
then got the power video and ground on
this<00:01:16.140> connector<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.580> yeah<00:01:18.360> again<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this connector here but yeah again you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
this connector here but yeah again you
can<00:01:19.259> slice<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.680> dice<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.299> one

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
can slice and dice that and you know one

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.840 
can slice and dice that and you know one
off<00:01:21.750> whichever<00:01:22.080> color<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.460> entirely

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
off whichever color you want is entirely

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.370 
off whichever color you want is entirely
up<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.159> we've<00:01:26.310> done<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.990> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
up to you so what we've done is got this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039 
up to you so what we've done is got this
set<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.820> channel<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.869> monitor

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
set up on the right channel the monitor

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
set up on the right channel the monitor
setup<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.860> channel<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> whole

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
setup on the right channel so the whole

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
setup on the right channel so the whole
thing<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> box<00:01:33.960> will<00:01:34.740> work

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
thing out of the box will work

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
thing out of the box will work
straightaway<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.630> soon<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.930> you've

you've<00:02:05.850> got<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.149> aircraft<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you've got on your aircraft you can just

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.050 
you've got on your aircraft you can just
wore<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.320> straight<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.129> eye

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
wore it straight up to your eye

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
distribution board so that's just

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.780 
distribution board so that's just
powered<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.739> there<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.670> which

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
powered up there and you see which

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
powered up there and you see which
channel<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.209> set<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:16.489> then<00:02:17.489> got<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.810> supply

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
channel is set to I then got the supply
