00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.470 
do it's literally all you do I don't
know<00:00:48.890> it's<00:00:49.890> probably<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.309> risk<00:00:50.670> Hosting

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
know it's probably a risk Hosting

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
know it's probably a risk Hosting
something<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
something like this because a lot of you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.750 
something like this because a lot of you
probably<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.550> probably

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
probably know about it so I'm probably

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
probably know about it so I'm probably
gonna<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.270> hate<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.199> then

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
gonna get a lot of hate for it but then

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.540 
gonna get a lot of hate for it but then
again<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.770> other<00:00:55.949> people<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.219> don't

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
