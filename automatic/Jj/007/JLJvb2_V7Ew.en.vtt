00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 [Music] 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.340
 good night friends and subscribers 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.630
 from youtube today I bring you a 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.520
 tweet called up save translation east 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.910
 tweet what makes us is to be able to download 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.470
 applications within the app are 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.380
 totally free applications 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.110
 pay like that as they listen to it first 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.220
 what are we going to do is go to cydia and go 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 go get wazers and write 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.790
 up save translation as you see there what 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.950
 can find two in two challenges in 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.100
 this time that I karmele just 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.630
 newly installed 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.450
 is betty hor apple 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.390
 and also what is the instant repo 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.340
 the one that is very well known is going to be 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.660
 that is not going to install to me I get 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.150
 modify in the top right 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.560
 then it 's a little respite and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.370
 then let's go to what is adjustments 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.370
 let's find the tweet 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.640
 here it's fine let's see 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.580
 to this shape app and we're going to choose these 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.229
 two options the first option is for 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.450
 to show us the percentage of the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.490
 download and the second option is for 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.010
 when we see an application within 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.760
 the app store that is cost us out 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.440
 the notice with a small box with the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.660
 name of the tweet saying that that 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 application is cost to be able 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.310
 download it and in the applications that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.720
 are free, nothing will come out 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.650
 let out 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.120
 let's go to the teacher for example I 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.330
 here I have my list 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.980
 my wish list and what I want 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.860
 download is this application here 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.170
 how do they see a dollar 99 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.170
 and as I come here we get the notice no 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 of the shaper app 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.170
 will load 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.040
 let's wait for it to load and for example 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.840
 can be trying in each of 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.370
 these options but for example we have 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.900
 an option here as well green 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.640
 that goes out that says direct 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.239
 we will do it there to install and ready we are going to 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.819
 wait for it to download here first 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.330
 find it right from the page 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.460
 where are you downloading this application 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.160
 and then let's see how little by little 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.800
 is going to be installed 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.590
 percentage and we will be able to later use 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.569
 the application 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.569
 let's wait for it to finish loading 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.819
 that always always takes so I recommend 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.099
 Wait, do not hurry 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.639
 while it's there we can go from 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.150
 suddenly looking for another one because we do not lose 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.150
 the race 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.140
 here 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.400
 behind 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.580
 let's see another application 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.540
 for example I'm here 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.300
 to iPhone 5 let's try this here 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.620
 capsa 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.620
 let's see what does not come out 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.220
 and that's also the fact that the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.000
 direct 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 install 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.720
 and that's the way to wait for the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.239
 applications as you can see right now 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.480
 you are downloading the first application 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:53.110
 that comes down and the second one also as they see 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.110
 it is at 16 by 117 and it keeps going up 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.840
 So you see what is working 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.129
 yes they have to be patient since as 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.800
 they noticed me in the first one not 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:09.560
 I turned it slowly so 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.560
 they have to be like I tell them patients 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.040
 all right 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.259
 now we are going to tell the app store 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.450
 As you can see, I already have some 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:23.060
 installed not for example this one 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.490
 I 'm not working with what's installed 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.950
 the application and I have now 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.080
 downloading something that is giving of 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.300
 dollars with a sale right now we are 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.050
 Let's see 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.139
 let's see is I'm here 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.030
 As you will know, there was still a couple of free 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.440
 days but now it is with costs but what 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.440
 I'm downloading totally for free 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.389
 so here I leave this video and 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.730
