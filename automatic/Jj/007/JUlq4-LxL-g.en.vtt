okay<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> spark<00:00:44.520> yeah

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
okay which is a spark yeah

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.049 
okay which is a spark yeah
and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.930> crank<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> turn<00:00:47.940> it

and then you crank you have to turn it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.200 
and then you crank you have to turn it
over<00:00:48.149> crap<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:48.660> cranking<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.320> hand<00:00:49.559> okay

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210

you show us the pedals here which ones

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.979 
you show us the pedals here which ones
would<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:54.000> spark<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> adjusts

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
would this is your spark that adjusts

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:55.880 
would this is your spark that adjusts
your<00:00:55.020> timing<00:00:55.590> okay

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
your timing okay

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
your timing okay
just<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> adjust<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.510> down<00:00:57.750> once<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
just up so you adjust that down once you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.529 
just up so you adjust that down once you
got<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> started<00:00:58.940> anyhow<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.329> low

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
got it started anyhow this is a low

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.039 
got it started anyhow this is a low
pedal<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.489> reverse<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> brake

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
pedal you can reverse this the brake

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.920 
pedal you can reverse this the brake
your<00:01:04.860> throttle<00:01:05.400> okay<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.119> old<00:01:06.240> throttle<00:01:06.780> was

here but we've installed those no no
okay<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.400> high

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.390 

which<00:01:14.659> when<00:01:15.320> you're<00:01:15.470> engaged<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.100> low<00:01:16.340> you

which when you're engaged in low you

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.780 
which when you're engaged in low you
push<00:01:16.850> your<00:01:16.970> high<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:21.100> as<00:01:22.100> soon<00:01:22.310> as<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.610> release

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
push your high in as soon as you release

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.660 
push your high in as soon as you release
low<00:01:23.360> then<00:01:24.050> it's<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.380> high<00:01:24.560> high<00:01:24.950> gear<00:01:25.310> just<00:01:25.550> to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
low then it's in high high gear just to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.670 
low then it's in high high gear just to
speeds<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:26.750> what<00:01:27.140> sort<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.350> tips<00:01:27.560> do<00:01:27.650> you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
speeds what what sort of tips do you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.219 
speeds what what sort of tips do you
have<00:01:27.740> for<00:01:27.830> someone<00:01:28.100> who's<00:01:28.540> not<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.080> familiar
