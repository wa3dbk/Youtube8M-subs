two<00:00:53.350> big<00:00:53.589> tips<00:00:53.859> here<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.399> first<00:00:54.699> one<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.410> make

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
two big tips here the first one is make

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.160 
two big tips here the first one is make
sure<00:00:56.440> that<00:00:56.829> your<00:00:57.010> backer<00:00:57.250> rod<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:58.030> beneath<00:00:58.809> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
sure that your backer rod is beneath the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.919 
sure that your backer rod is beneath the
surface<00:00:59.379> of<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.579> concrete<00:01:00.940> pads<00:01:01.300> otherwise

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
surface of the concrete pads otherwise

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.299 
surface of the concrete pads otherwise
you're<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.379> have<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.499> hump<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:02.829> forms

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
you're going to have a hump that forms

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.130 
you're going to have a hump that forms
between<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.820> backer<00:01:04.180> rod<00:01:04.480> and<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.869> self

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
between the backer rod and the self

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.679 
between the backer rod and the self
leveling<00:01:05.530> sealant<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.189> that's<00:01:06.670> bad<00:01:07.000> news<00:01:07.360> if

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
leveling sealant and that's bad news if

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.960 
leveling sealant and that's bad news if
you<00:01:07.840> use<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.619> snow<00:01:09.130> blower<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.729> winter

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
you use a snow blower in the winter

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.580 
you use a snow blower in the winter
because<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.390> snow<00:01:10.600> bladder<00:01:10.869> will<00:01:11.079> catch<00:01:11.350> on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
because the snow bladder will catch on

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.859 
because the snow bladder will catch on
the<00:01:11.710> sealant<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.280> tear<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.060> out<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
the sealant and tear it out of the

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.080 
the sealant and tear it out of the

use<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.350> backer<00:01:17.710> rod<00:01:18.009> that's<00:01:18.310> one<00:01:18.610> eighth<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:19.180> an

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
use a backer rod that's one eighth of an

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.319 
use a backer rod that's one eighth of an
inch<00:01:19.479> wider<00:01:20.409> in<00:01:20.740> diameter<00:01:21.130> than<00:01:21.670> your<00:01:21.909> joint

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
inch wider in diameter than your joint

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.600 
inch wider in diameter than your joint
