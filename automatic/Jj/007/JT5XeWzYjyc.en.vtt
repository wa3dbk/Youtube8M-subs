00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.539
 I hold a big one from the real ones 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.250

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.949

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.030
 smaller youtuber and it is just 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.649
 just like the real ones were and that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.239
 I also want to be with the future 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.059

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.159

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:54.889
 mines and I would definitely 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.960
 happy if participants sign up here 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.639
 I would write the tsv in the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.399
 description if they do them only 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.370
 then when would it start 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.990
 announce in the next video info 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.390
 and I would be happy if 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.240
 now a big youtuber from fencing 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.620
 was here now the video point I will 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020
 I definitely look forward to it when you get up 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.750
 make your feedback would be fine 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.120
 is that we stop now the smaller ones 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.580
 Now open the project of yours 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.630
 or bad is that we stole that 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.670
 have of you and prefer your own 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.650
 to invent 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.260
 Well, I think it's definitely that 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.060
 the spectator was from 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.400
 maybe even take part in it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.110
 Here's why mini project and that 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.790
 can experience for yourself 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.500
 I will be happy in any case 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.900
 if there are also participants 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 you can stick to the rules 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.940
 regularly upload and record 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.190
 the contrary, we know even from hardcore 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.380
 Project I have a hardcore project 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.480
 made a few months or years ago 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.480
 Maybe, but no months, I think 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.229
 So if you are from years then yes 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.630
 main channels finally really older and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.340
 then there just have me and one 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.290
 others have uploaded the others 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.850
 I'm uploaded that's real 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.370
 been funny 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.380
 it was just so vivaro when you die 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.660
 then you have to stop but not so 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.959
 just like rapp and then he was still 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.360
 minecraft guess what version 1.6 you 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.520
 Fifth, I think that's not the point 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.280
 In any case, the participants like to be in 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.830
 they like to come in the ts and me 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.170
 hope you like my idea that too 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.630
 make and 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.630
 until the next video pure skin
