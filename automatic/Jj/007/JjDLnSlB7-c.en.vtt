00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Not 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.980
 that can be people's invention 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.980
 but the new ones have to go to a capacitive screen 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.659
 and that is why stupidly with children earlier donations usually does not come 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.810
 really far 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.720
 would not be a problem No if things did not have to enter texts and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.000
 Well, if you look at the production between and that was my mistake 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.059
 you can imagine that does not work wonderful we are already such 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.710
 Having a piece of meat is not a problem if you have too much money 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.480
 or multicultural and adapt themselves to build our ship 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.100
 save a total of fifth car 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 the first would of course be a piece of itself which is suitable for example 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.030
 Martha Coakley fine 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.360
 then you would need something of this slightly oblique look you will find 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.240
 For example, when you buy with electronic components or even to 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.290
 Example with motherboards judgment because so under it 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.890
 Â«Then some tape would need 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.840
 a little aluminum foil 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.680
 and no wire to connect that should be here if possible with that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.580
 him the high goodness lot of small plates 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 Assemble Leitha next to percent 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.110
 that has to paint the chips now 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.300
 I think that everyone who wrote on 4 already did 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.460
 the Nina Bruckner is no longer the combo 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 she may all damage already expanded if so now front piece and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 the children's piece 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.710
 then we also need some of these here a little strip I've got you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.670
 cut off for a-tec and a bit 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.080
 twirled together 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.250
 he comes in here in front 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.840
 and he is learning with Janina, for example 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350
 make your back 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.880
 the St a 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.329
 Round comes out 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.610
 Kiki wins us well 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.950
 now calls for big Eurich 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.860
 the beautiful piece traveled 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 that is the contact surface to the phone 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.990
 wonderful 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.229
 as a second goal always somehow a connection to the hand 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.339
 We send a clear message about holding on 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:16.069
 either you can see the problem that he was in Turin after that 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.419
 my world 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.609
 the contact with is one hundred percent 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.459
 ULA and at the test match where you hold him most cases 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 so try the shares here 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.399
 you need the aluminum foil for that 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:30.509
 0 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.559
 to claim that 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.599
 I've made it a little bigger here normally 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:40.729
 Should it work a bit smaller, it threatens to break away from 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.629
 usual practice 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.799
 So make the strip with some tape 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.239
 would have made more sense white local time had set penalties 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.669
 always Minden kn 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.569
 about as many from the top 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.569
 PlÃ¼ss splinters well Malich to hold more 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.529
 Pravda Metz 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.729
 and products allow such 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.729
 AP the ISU no longer have the bay 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.319
 brisk said the little bear subdivision always shakes a bit 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.449
 Camenically lost 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:28.839
 &amp; Cie 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.169
 these 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.229
 the more to say 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.719
 Breed chickens 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.719
 the always in between scart-jacks possession of the city are indeed first 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.939
 until now 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.889
 Kitsch the aluminum foil 8 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.889
 hang out 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.629
 I got stuck with tape at the end again, you could as well 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.079
 work smash-hit from the inside with double-sided tape 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.459
 then the whole is probably still 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.389
 a little better 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.799
 and this frayed one will not occur that fast, though 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.439
 now at the first endurance test 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.849
 Kauder he puts it 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.659
 the state is outside 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.039
 and we have to stand out from the degree here 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.749
 in the castle itself also the method good luck as the sticks just there 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:18.430
 prepare and make 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.870
 in the hope that somehow always gets contact 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.870
 bit fanned out Chung school's out 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.520
 and honestly 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 Spock to say so with the winner 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.710
 Therefore, the small fine roadway were allowed 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.710
 theoretically work better 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.590
 so that her team 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.309
 that they try now 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.329
 so again a quick look at ca pen I have 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.759
 and why 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.090
 the punished dumped 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.590
 that certainly can not set up 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.809
 Percent now would have to wait a bit too 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.889
 the top should get out well 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:04:59.690
 become 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.470
 which might call this day might be too much pressure for example 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.449
 that is scratched and that would of course be a bit unfavorable 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.270
 such a thing did not please 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.699
 Finances through the aluminum foil and pies make contact 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.099
 and on the phone 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.419
 are always very good signs 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.749
 under yes there below 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:23.309
 can also lead 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:25.020
 capacitive touchscreen 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.590
 and i have to try with my posting then serve on his display 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.159
 sda 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.999
