average<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.709> your<00:02:13.739> weigh-ins<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.489> that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
average of all your weigh-ins for that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.940 
average of all your weigh-ins for that
week<00:02:15.090> okay

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
week okay

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.369 
week okay
now<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.430> again<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.140> same

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
now you do this again with the same

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.850 
now you do this again with the same
calories<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.480> then<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> second<00:02:22.709> week

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
calories and then for the second week

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.000 
calories and then for the second week
you'll<00:02:23.280> again<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:24.450> an<00:02:24.629> average<00:02:24.840> weigh-in<00:02:25.470> now

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you'll again get an average weigh-in now

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.500 
you'll again get an average weigh-in now
what<00:02:26.220> you're<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.000> you're<00:02:27.480> going

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.080 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:02:27.810> compare<00:02:28.470> these<00:02:28.709> two<00:02:28.769> average<00:02:29.489> weigh-ins

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
to compare these two average weigh-ins

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.289 
to compare these two average weigh-ins
alright<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.890> new<00:02:32.099> average<00:02:32.430> weigh-in

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
alright so if the new average weigh-in

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.640 
alright so if the new average weigh-in
is<00:02:34.250> say<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.459> example<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:36.090> quarter<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.410> pound

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
is say for example a quarter of a pound

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.030 
is say for example a quarter of a pound
heavier<00:02:38.269> than<00:02:39.269> last<00:02:39.840> week's<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.890> my

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
heavier than last week's then you my

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.729 
heavier than last week's then you my
friend<00:02:41.069> are<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.940> surplus<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:42.629> you<00:02:43.530> can

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
friend are in a surplus and you can

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.970 
friend are in a surplus and you can
continue<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.310> stay<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.670> those<00:02:44.910> calories

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
continue to stay on those calories

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.160 
continue to stay on those calories
continue<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.099> weigh<00:02:47.220> yourself<00:02:47.340> every<00:02:48.000> day<00:02:48.170> get

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
continue to weigh yourself every day get

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.750 
continue to weigh yourself every day get
that<00:02:49.349> average<00:02:49.530> weigh<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.310> calculate

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
that average weigh in and calculate

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.720 
that average weigh in and calculate
again<00:02:51.269> now<00:02:51.510> for<00:02:51.569> example<00:02:52.290> let's<00:02:53.220> say<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
again now for example let's say the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.380 
again now for example let's say the
following<00:02:54.180> week<00:02:54.799> your<00:02:55.799> average<00:02:56.129> weight<00:02:56.640> does

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
following week your average weight does

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.500 
following week your average weight does
not<00:02:57.420> increase<00:02:58.109> at<00:02:58.379> all<00:02:58.879> stays<00:02:59.879> exactly<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
not increase at all stays exactly the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.069 
not increase at all stays exactly the
same

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
same

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.229 
same
then<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:02.040> would<00:03:02.220> encourage<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.879> do<00:03:03.030> is

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
then all I would encourage you to do is

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.860 
then all I would encourage you to do is
slightly<00:03:03.650> increase<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:05.489> carb<00:03:06.120> intake<00:03:06.329> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
slightly increase your carb intake and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.380 
slightly increase your carb intake and
then<00:03:07.470> run<00:03:07.980> those<00:03:08.250> new<00:03:08.489> numbers<00:03:08.849> again<00:03:09.150> for

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
then run those new numbers again for

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.580 
then run those new numbers again for
another<00:03:09.540> week<00:03:09.810> while<00:03:10.019> still<00:03:10.319> weighing

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
another week while still weighing

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.400 
another week while still weighing
yourself<00:03:11.160> every<00:03:11.459> day<00:03:11.629> get<00:03:12.629> that<00:03:12.810> average<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
yourself every day get that average and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.970 
yourself every day get that average and
you<00:03:13.530> should<00:03:13.829> again<00:03:14.549> be<00:03:14.579> in<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.209> caloric<00:03:15.510> surplus

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
you should again be in a caloric surplus

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.009 
you should again be in a caloric surplus
continue<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.099> run<00:03:17.310> those<00:03:17.519> same<00:03:17.849> numbers<00:03:18.090> until

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
continue to run those same numbers until

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.680 
continue to run those same numbers until
you<00:03:19.169> plateau<00:03:19.500> again<00:03:20.099> once<00:03:20.669> you<00:03:20.819> do<00:03:21.060> take<00:03:21.480> those

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you plateau again once you do take those

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.599 
you plateau again once you do take those
steps<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.169> increasing<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.889> carbs<00:03:23.190> slightly

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
steps of increasing the carbs slightly

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.180 
steps of increasing the carbs slightly
again<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.150> running<00:03:24.750> those<00:03:25.049> numbers<00:03:25.560> alright

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
again and running those numbers alright

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.309 
again and running those numbers alright
so<00:03:26.400> what<00:03:26.579> that's<00:03:26.700> going<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.389> again<00:03:28.139> is

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
so what that's going to do again is

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.690 
so what that's going to do again is
ensure<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.639> you<00:03:29.910> are<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.630> constant<00:03:30.989> or

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
ensure that you are in a constant or

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.520 
ensure that you are in a constant or
consistent<00:03:32.700> caloric<00:03:33.540> surplus<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.380> have

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
consistent caloric surplus you have

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.680 
consistent caloric surplus you have
enough<00:03:35.030> nutrients<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:36.180> body<00:03:36.329> to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
enough nutrients in your body to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.920 
enough nutrients in your body to
continue<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.319> put<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.739> muscle<00:03:38.519> mass<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.750> right

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
continue to put on muscle mass all right

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.680 
continue to put on muscle mass all right
so<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:41.489> problem<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.120> weighing

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
so the problem with just weighing

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.659 
so the problem with just weighing
yourself<00:03:42.900> randomly<00:03:43.769> say<00:03:43.980> for<00:03:44.190> example<00:03:44.609> I

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
yourself randomly say for example I

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.729 
yourself randomly say for example I
weigh<00:03:44.849> myself<00:03:45.060> today<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.019> weigh<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> hundred

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
weigh myself today and I weigh a hundred

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.069 
weigh myself today and I weigh a hundred
and<00:03:46.950> fifty<00:03:47.549> pounds<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:48.329> next<00:03:48.569> Monday<00:03:48.900> I

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
and fifty pounds and then next Monday I

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.220 
and fifty pounds and then next Monday I
weigh<00:03:49.470> myself<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.099> I'm<00:03:50.269> 149<00:03:51.269> pounds<00:03:51.630> I'm

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
weigh myself and I'm 149 pounds I'm

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.559 
weigh myself and I'm 149 pounds I'm
going<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.829> assume<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.489> I'm<00:03:53.910> losing<00:03:54.329> weight

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
going to assume that I'm losing weight

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.319 
going to assume that I'm losing weight
but<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.500> may<00:03:56.099> not<00:03:56.129> be<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.730> case<00:03:57.000> right

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
but that may not be the case right

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.460 
but that may not be the case right
because<00:03:57.870> there's<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.379> many<00:03:59.720> things<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.989> can

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
because there's so many things that can

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.580 
because there's so many things that can
kind<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.310> manipulate<00:04:02.629> how<00:04:03.629> much<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.260> weigh

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
kind of manipulate how much you weigh

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.640 
kind of manipulate how much you weigh
that<00:04:05.129> day<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:06.180> what<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.840> really<00:04:07.109> want<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.560> do

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
that day so what you really want to do

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.250 
that day so what you really want to do
is<00:04:07.799> focus<00:04:08.099> on<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.760> average<00:04:09.000> weigh<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.079> as

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
is focus on that average weigh in as

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.559 
is focus on that average weigh in as
long<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.949> average<00:04:11.489> weigh<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.090> going

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
long as that average weigh in is going

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.550 
long as that average weigh in is going
up<00:04:12.930> slowly<00:04:13.560> over<00:04:14.190> time<00:04:14.430> then<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.510> are<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.320> a

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
up slowly over time then you are in a

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560 
up slowly over time then you are in a
surplus<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.639> are<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.209> be<00:04:18.329> able<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
surplus and you are going to be able to
