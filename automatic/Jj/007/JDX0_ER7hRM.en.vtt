00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 And that is admirable Hansa Rostock 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.550
 continues to work in front of the team 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.500
 has objected in the past few weeks 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.780
 all the clubs played at the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.870
 Table top stand against Bielefeld 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.000
 rostock still lost to duisburg 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 there was already a draw and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 today against the stuttgart kickers has 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
 Rostock lost at home 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.710
 excuse won of course and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.750
 that underlines the home strength, too 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.760
 the team at the moment has the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.430
 including this player here too 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 owe 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.239
 Halil Safran the last four games 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.719
 had always met respect 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 procures and with the opponents 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 marcel ziemer today first on the bank 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 but such a calf injury again 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 recovered first half fast 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.710
 summarized no combination no 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.710
 wing play hardly any chances 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.070
 this is the only one on rostocker side 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.289
 Saffron and then bickel the ball 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.710
 misjudged that was it already with the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.460
 first half no highlights 10,600 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.590
 spectators see an event-less game 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.580
 in which the rostocker tip is not in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.170
 scene can be set 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 if it works playfully then yes 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.990
 maybe with a standard rupprecht 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.320
 screws up 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.630
 the king of the skies was pretty close 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.110
 turn here the first big chance in the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.780
 2 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 then comes marcel ziemer for the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.330
 hapless wake year 60 minute and now 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.740
 will it slow another game as 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.370
 player at the sideline with the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.160
 throw in saffron passes on and everything 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.040
 suddenly far left 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.600
 the captain with the 1 0 in the 61 minute 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.470
 stuttgart protests because saffron here 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.410
 came to fall 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.510
 but referee florian athletes 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.050
 continue to run beneficial and that counts 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.240
 gate 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.170
 as first for him for over half 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.610
 year 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.660
 Seven minutes later the other side 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.420
 Rostock defenders do one 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.080
 good job today, especially marco kofler 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.300
 but here 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.310
 there is simply no way to let the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.630
 stuttgarter come to the pen and 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.850
 train it on the post 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.100
 the experience of the season teaches approach 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.380
 That is why it should be done often enough 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.880
 is still a late-game goal now 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.150
 christian bickel on the left side 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 try it yourself and the most striking 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.060
 hansa player awards stuttgart throws 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.950
 now all forward also the goalkeeper 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.050
 in yellow maybe the chance now 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.270
 when it's fast bickel on 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.100
 room and with the lupfer has not 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.800
 but it should be traded 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.150
 Wins 1 0 earned with the return 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 zelaya also has a small one 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.270
 jerked by the audience and also 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.710
 in the team and you have 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.120
 seen how dangerous is in the 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.920
 Last days it was called by the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.150
 team colleagues a warm you 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.700
 now also slow down 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.260
 the sun is shining we play so well 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.260
 now only that is missing you again 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.240
 snaps the captain as a matchwinner and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.680
 Rostock rejoices with everyone 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.340
 play a little bit more out of that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.820
 fight out the dispute over the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.820
 future
