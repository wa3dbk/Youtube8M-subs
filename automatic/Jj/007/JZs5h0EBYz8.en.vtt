00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
well what that layout did and how it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.710 
well what that layout did and how it
affected<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.580> ball<00:02:17.790> cuz<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.060> already<00:02:18.540> knew

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
affected this ball cuz we already knew

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.930 
affected this ball cuz we already knew
this<00:02:19.200> ball<00:02:19.470> was<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.709> be<00:02:19.890> strong<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.670> with

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
this ball was gonna be strong and with

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.980 
this ball was gonna be strong and with
the<00:02:21.030> new<00:02:21.120> cover<00:02:21.330> stock<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.630> was<00:02:21.750> gonna<00:02:21.870> be

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the new cover stock it was gonna be

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.180 
the new cover stock it was gonna be
slightly<00:02:22.200> cleaner<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.800> front<00:02:23.010> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
slightly cleaner through the front and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.810 
slightly cleaner through the front and
stronger<00:02:23.490> down<00:02:23.610> lane<00:02:24.320> man<00:02:25.320> yeah<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.610> been<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
stronger down lane man yeah it's been a

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.699 
stronger down lane man yeah it's been a
long<00:02:26.970> time<00:02:27.150> since<00:02:27.330> I've<00:02:27.510> seen<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.780> ball<00:02:28.260> layout

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
long time since I've seen a ball layout

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.410 
long time since I've seen a ball layout
that<00:02:28.920> actually<00:02:29.370> makes<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:30.030> big<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.360> a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that actually makes this big of a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.480 
that actually makes this big of a
difference<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:31.320> ball<00:02:31.470> reaction<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.310> this

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
difference to ball reaction it's this

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.880 
difference to ball reaction it's this
crazy<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.230> see<00:02:34.350> Wayne<00:02:34.530> was<00:02:34.680> playing

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
crazy like you can see Wayne was playing

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.800 
crazy like you can see Wayne was playing
down<00:02:35.070> tight<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:36.090> he's<00:02:36.209> moved<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> little

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
down tight now he's moved in a little

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.130 
down tight now he's moved in a little
bit<00:02:37.080> that's<00:02:42.320> wrong<00:02:43.320> that's<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:44.220> dirty<00:02:44.640> yeah

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
bit that's wrong that's not dirty yeah

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.020 
bit that's wrong that's not dirty yeah
but<00:02:46.140> once<00:02:46.290> again<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.890> great<00:02:47.130> ball<00:02:47.430> reaction

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

reaction it's not jumpy no no yes
wasn't<00:04:13.260> super<00:04:13.770> hard<00:04:13.980> off<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.130> spot<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.610> just

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
wasn't super hard off the spot it's just

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.570 
wasn't super hard off the spot it's just
a<00:04:14.850> nice<00:04:15.060> subtle<00:04:15.750> move<00:04:16.140> which<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.100> love<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.520> love

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
a nice subtle move which I love I love

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.620 
a nice subtle move which I love I love
that<00:04:18.030> motion

that motion

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.050 
that motion
well<00:04:18.930> subtle<00:04:19.620> for<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.920> know<00:04:20.070> 10<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.790> 12

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
well subtle for you know 10 to 12

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.510 
well subtle for you know 10 to 12
exactly<00:04:21.900> yeah<00:04:22.110> yeah<00:04:22.380> it's<00:04:22.920> not<00:04:23.100> like<00:04:23.310> it's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
exactly yeah yeah it's not like it's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.340 
exactly yeah yeah it's not like it's
like<00:04:23.820> ripping<00:04:24.330> across<00:04:24.420> a<00:04:24.660> straight<00:04:25.200> angle

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
like ripping across a straight angle

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.800 
like ripping across a straight angle
like<00:04:25.740> yeah<00:04:26.100> not<00:04:26.280> off<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.550> spot<00:04:26.790> Here<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.120> am<00:04:27.300> and

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
like yeah not off the spot Here I am and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.500 
like yeah not off the spot Here I am and
you<00:04:28.470> can<00:04:28.620> see<00:04:28.860> how<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.700> creates<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.210> lot<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.390> a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
you can see how it creates a lot of a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.830 
you can see how it creates a lot of a
lot<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.720> energy<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.950> is<00:04:32.070> very<00:04:32.580> very<00:04:33.120> smooth<00:04:33.660> on

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
lot of energy and is very very smooth on

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.600 
lot of energy and is very very smooth on
the<00:04:33.930> backend<00:04:34.110> for<00:04:34.350> me<00:04:34.590> now<00:04:34.800> as<00:04:35.100> we<00:04:35.340> said

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the backend for me now as we said

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.990 
the backend for me now as we said
beforehand<00:04:36.800> this<00:04:37.800> was<00:04:38.190> giving<00:04:38.520> me<00:04:38.640> anywhere

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
beforehand this was giving me anywhere

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.790 
beforehand this was giving me anywhere

those of you who can do math and know

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.930 
those of you who can do math and know
the<00:04:49.650> size<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:50.010> bowling<00:04:50.160> ball<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:50.640> realize

the size of a bowling ball you realize
that<00:04:50.970> at<00:04:51.330> some<00:04:51.690> points<00:04:52.050> this<00:04:52.170> ball<00:04:52.410> was

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
that at some points this ball was

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.440 
that at some points this ball was
actually<00:04:52.890> rolling<00:04:53.130> in<00:04:53.370> backwards<00:04:53.970> for<00:04:54.300> me

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
actually rolling in backwards for me

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.280 
actually rolling in backwards for me
yeah<00:04:54.920> so<00:04:55.940> for<00:04:56.940> your<00:04:57.270> higher<00:04:57.540> revver<00:04:57.930> players

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
yeah so for your higher revver players

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.700 
yeah so for your higher revver players
it<00:04:59.010> might<00:04:59.430> not<00:04:59.700> be<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.030> best<00:05:00.210> layout<00:05:00.710> however

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
it might not be the best layout however

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.460 
it might not be the best layout however
