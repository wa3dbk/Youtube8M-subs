a lot of products which I think could be

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.130 
a lot of products which I think could be
great<00:00:32.050> for<00:00:32.410> hockey<00:00:33.250> so<00:00:33.610> here's<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.630> puck<00:00:34.840> it's

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
it looks more like a roller hockey puck

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.090 
it looks more like a roller hockey puck
or<00:00:42.700> inline<00:00:43.090> puck<00:00:43.390> then<00:00:44.110> I<00:00:44.140> ice<00:00:44.410> hockey<00:00:44.860> puck

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
or inline puck then I ice hockey puck

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.270 
or inline puck then I ice hockey puck

as you can see when I do my review and
really<00:00:51.400> like<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.730> design<00:00:51.880> comes<00:00:52.810> in<00:00:52.960> many

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140

nice and I see it as a great feedback

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.340 
nice and I see it as a great feedback
off<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.280> one-timer<00:01:51.850> model<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:53.170> really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
off the one-timer model it's really

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.950 
off the one-timer model it's really
smooth<00:01:58.710> also<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.799> can<00:01:59.830> see<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.600> same

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
smooth also you can see not the same

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:15.780 
smooth also you can see not the same
with<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.090> pop<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.380> now<00:02:14.530> let's<00:02:14.769> get<00:02:14.920> more<00:02:15.549> to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
with this pop so now let's get more to

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.290 
with this pop so now let's get more to
prepare

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.140 

I<00:02:24.380> really<00:02:25.380> talk<00:02:25.530> about<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.670> really

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
I really talk about it is it really

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:37.390 
I really talk about it is it really
sticks<00:02:27.590> well<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:31.580> practice<00:02:32.580> stick<00:02:32.910> handling

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.950 

that's<00:02:38.400> great<00:02:38.730> deal<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.150> trial<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.750> ice

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
that's great deal on trial and ice

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.780 
that's great deal on trial and ice
and<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.560> means<00:02:42.740> it's<00:02:42.980> also<00:02:43.250> good<00:02:43.670> on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and that means it's also good on

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.730 
and that means it's also good on
shooting<00:02:44.240> boards<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.780> shoot<00:02:45.050> off<00:02:45.290> them<00:02:45.530> so

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
shooting boards to shoot off them so

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.380 
shooting boards to shoot off them so
that's<00:02:45.950> great<00:02:46.280> also<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:49.190> all<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.670> same<00:02:49.970> size

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
that's great also it's all the same size

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.350 
that's great also it's all the same size
as<00:02:50.810> an<00:02:50.990> ice<00:02:51.140> hockey<00:02:51.380> puck<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.010> thickness<00:02:52.460> so

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
as an ice hockey puck the thickness so

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.230 
as an ice hockey puck the thickness so
if<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.200> want<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.560> use<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.890> skinnier<00:02:55.400> roller

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
if you want to use the skinnier roller

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.180 
if you want to use the skinnier roller
hockey<00:02:56.450> puck<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:57.050> wouldn't<00:02:57.350> be<00:02:57.440> good<00:02:57.650> because

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
hockey puck it wouldn't be good because

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:18.190 
hockey puck it wouldn't be good because
you<00:02:58.400> can't<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.880> double

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.510
