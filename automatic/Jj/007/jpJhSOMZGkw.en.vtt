00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
have to be a patch which they were

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520 
have to be a patch which they were
testing<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:36.840> days<00:00:37.020> ago<00:00:37.050> when<00:00:37.440> they

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
testing out two days ago when they

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
testing out two days ago when they
finally<00:00:37.800> obviously<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.180> completely

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
finally obviously got it completely

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
finally obviously got it completely
perfect<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.230> hope<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> fingers<00:00:41.280> crossed

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
perfect on hope and fingers crossed

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.680 
perfect on hope and fingers crossed
because<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.030> release<00:00:42.300> their<00:00:42.480> patches

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
because when they release their patches

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.240 
because when they release their patches
is<00:00:43.050> always<00:00:43.260> something<00:00:43.440> else<00:00:43.739> wrong<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.100> has

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
is always something else wrong that has

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
is always something else wrong that has
to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.430> done<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.879> another<00:00:45.120> patch<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.500> on

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to be done with another patch and so on

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.430 
to be done with another patch and so on
so<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.520> hoping<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.270> fax<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.960> fixes

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.439 
so on but I'm hoping this fax this fixes
it<00:00:49.590> tremendously<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> I've<00:00:51.120> actually

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it tremendously and I've actually

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.150 
it tremendously and I've actually
already<00:00:51.780> gone<00:00:52.079> ahead<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> done<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> update

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
already gone ahead and done the update

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.590 
already gone ahead and done the update
and<00:00:53.309> I've<00:00:53.399> gone<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:54.059> plane<00:00:54.270> everything

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and I've gone on to my plane everything

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
and I've gone on to my plane everything
you're<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> video<00:00:55.410> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you're going to see in the video this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
you're going to see in the video this
country<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.399> done<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:57.030> live<00:00:57.239> because

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
country is done not live because

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.389 
country is done not live because
obviously<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.469> does<00:00:58.710> take<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.100> while

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
obviously it does take a little while

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.709 
obviously it does take a little while
for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> patch<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.270> kick<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.600> after

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
for the patch to kind of kick in after

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
for the patch to kind of kick in after
it<00:01:01.379> installs<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:02.370> downloads<00:01:02.760> after<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it installs not downloads after it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.700 
it installs not downloads after it
installs<00:01:03.210> it'll<00:01:03.660> probably<00:01:03.809> take<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.559> about

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
installs it'll probably take right about

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
installs it'll probably take right about
two<00:01:04.979> minutes<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.610> actually<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
two minutes to actually go on to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660 
two minutes to actually go on to
multiplayer<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.409> main<00:01:07.530> menu<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
multiplayer or the main menu for you it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.500 
multiplayer or the main menu for you it
will<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.060> while<00:01:09.180> you'll<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
will take a little while you'll have a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
will take a little while you'll have a
black<00:01:09.720> screen<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.229> worry<00:01:10.380> guys<00:01:10.590> there's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
black screen don't worry guys there's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
black screen don't worry guys there's
nothing<00:01:11.189> dodgy<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> did

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
nothing dodgy going on there and did

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.850 
nothing dodgy going on there and did
exactly<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.930> same<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.200> me<00:01:13.320> obviously<00:01:13.439> Isis

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
exactly the same with me obviously Isis

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.960 
exactly the same with me obviously Isis
where<00:01:14.010> everything<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.340> kicking<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.820> going

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
where everything is kicking in and going

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.890 
where everything is kicking in and going
into<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.630> shaping<00:01:16.229> perfectly<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> yeah

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
into in shaping perfectly and yeah

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.359 
into in shaping perfectly and yeah
that's<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.830> basically<00:01:20.220> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that's about it really so basically this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.570 
that's about it really so basically this
completely<00:01:21.119> gets<00:01:21.509> rid<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> freezing<00:01:22.590> I'm

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
completely gets rid of the freezing I'm

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
completely gets rid of the freezing I'm
hoping<00:01:23.909> obviously<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:24.900> you've<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> scratch

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hoping obviously if you've got a scratch

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
hoping obviously if you've got a scratch
