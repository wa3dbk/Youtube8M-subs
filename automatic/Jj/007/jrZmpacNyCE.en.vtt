00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.740
 spider-man 3 and the spin-off depp in the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.179
 spider woman movie is a rumor a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.160
 rumor that both fans and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.320
 involved you will love to see in the great 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 screen the first to play with the idea 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 of introduced female version of the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 spiderman at the movies was marc webb 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 when he expressed interest in having 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.430
 spider woman in time sting spider-man 2 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 that in the end there was a wink number in a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 discussion between Peter and Harry the last 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640
 in joining in motion has been the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 actress doctor jÃºcar in milan during a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.910
 interview in which he has stated his 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.980
 willingness to give it life if it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.630
 offered on paper by the way also 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.059
 this crisis could be the role of Mary 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 jane since it has a lot of similarity but 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 so far it is said that now that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 it will be charlotte buckley which will interpret 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 to mary jane watson amazing spider-man 3 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 It could be the starting point for a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 room with spin-off in which sony could 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 follow a similar path to that of the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.660
 avengers or for example where are 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.820
 multiple characters and the movies that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.949
 they are released on them and if they are and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 pose will present my daughter parker of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.159
 peter as spider gif or spider-man black 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.560
 or spider-man 2099 or scarlet line 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.270
 rent rumors run from a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.460
 way that you would have and to make 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.899
 spider-man an own universe with 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 multiple characters and with the 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.890
 possibility of spin-offs a form of 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.630
 increase competition and increase 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 those revenues that are so worrying to the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 producer now let's go to what 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.149
 interesting is over spin off the event 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.099
 on screen road carried out a 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.659
 interview with emma stone about it is 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.060
 his character in spider movies 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.369
 man could come back in some way and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 she answered the following I do not know is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.020
 possible there could be something I do not know there 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.789
 a whole plot that can happen that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 can bring it back in the version 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.689
 ultimate gwen stacy was killed by the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.789
 symbiont meat if it looks like it was up 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.709
 the creature absorbed his body during 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.500
 his first meeting in editions 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.390
 later peter parker or spider-man 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.489
 surprised to see something stage and live and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 well but without memories of what happened 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.719
 before his death it became clear 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.219
 that was in fact the symbiotic itself 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.319
 ernest that has taken the form of gwen 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.269
 stacy but after this one was 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.250
 murdered they thought that now really 

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.289
 it was gwen stacy the blogger adds in addition 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.119
 who are seeing even last version 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.709
 of meat in the venom spin-off that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.060
 suggests the search for a character with 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.760
 features similar to those of 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.220
