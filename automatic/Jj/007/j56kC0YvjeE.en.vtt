partly this is really really good stuff

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.959 
partly this is really really good stuff
because<00:06:28.810> apparently<00:06:30.520> lots<00:06:31.520> of<00:06:31.610> people<00:06:31.849> are

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
because apparently lots of people are

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.339 
because apparently lots of people are
saying<00:06:32.150> that<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.509> has<00:06:32.630> come<00:06:32.840> together<00:06:33.020> really

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
saying that it has come together really

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.189

well<00:06:33.440> when<00:06:34.280> they<00:06:34.460> pee<00:06:34.669> when<00:06:35.570> they<00:06:35.690> whimper<00:06:36.080> in

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
well when they pee when they whimper in

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.570 
well when they pee when they whimper in
it<00:06:36.349> so<00:06:38.380> it'd<00:06:39.380> be<00:06:39.560> really<00:06:39.710> good<00:06:39.889> good

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
it so it'd be really good good

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.059 
it so it'd be really good good
now<00:06:40.930> if<00:06:41.930> it<00:06:42.020> does<00:06:42.139> cook<00:06:42.349> together<00:06:42.530> well<00:06:42.830> when
