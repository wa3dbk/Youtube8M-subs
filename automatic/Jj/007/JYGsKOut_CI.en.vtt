00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 You had better should know always who's Hello is a Shinsaku Uesugi It is this time beginners 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.130
 I would like to talk about bait without scalar 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:18.539
 Scalarless makeup is white end using queen and bishop 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.020
 Refers to checkmate with f 2 or 7 s chain 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.430
 So actually this is moving 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.590
 Let's scalar not a weight try to is take a look at because what kind of thing the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:36.850
 The focus of white is not orthodox to open the road of refurbish shop and green 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:38.620
 I contrast black also has a good fight dream I to Shiro This is a very affair Wisdom 5 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.010
 It is Tsu not jump key 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.210
 I started playing chess 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.239
 In those days I had a hard time to stole the g 6 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:53.300
 This is so bad I wonder why 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.739
 This lane is captured by capturing 9 silver tape files and pawns and stabbing further with g 6 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.460
 I have opened it 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.030
 So let's go after I've checked here 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.100
 Instantly reach the market 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.420
 Somehow Tara Sasodei and that is visible above the black frame such as were sisters observe this pawn 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
 Must be 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 Black is here with light c 6 future developments 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.470
 Refers to the efficiency of protecting 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 White expand the dictionary clause four here 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:27.780
 I will put pressure on the game here and if you're just starting to play chess here you will have diagonal movements and 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.530
 It's very easy to see what I am saying , unless it's here that we're going to expand f 6 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.920
 You may be tempted to attack the clean 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.960
 Look at this 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:43.490
 White is through system of the two-intake part and checkmate Surogasu colors mate 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.439
 There are ways you, but some of the deal of scalar not a mate in 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:54.289
 For example, phosphorus affair when dedicated this day shop Seafort 7 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:58.830
 Or check by keeping the 4 f 7 at the queen as a clean s norito 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:04.260
 You can prevent the maid or here with g 6 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.920
 You can also protect the Queen lane indirectly and protect the body after f 7 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.390
 This 4 ate in some of this there is no guarding Pau now 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.690
 Can not 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:20.490
 Scalar not a name and Terra hurts white players orders hack when stabbed with this g 6 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.150
 Quinn fp and let's go here and let d for now 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.490
 If it happens 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.380
 9 is not black here I will be multiplied by the intake f you and checkmate large two 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:35.110
 Expand the seeding box and further min 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.250
 Formed a human crisis and here, for example, you can sag and white stomach pain of crying usually 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.530
 If it comes 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:46.570
 Come and expand the g 7 Doubtobishop together, and then check it if you castling 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.400
 I, for example, white you do not have to worry about say mate again another here to f 7 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:54.769
 There is a strike over the pressure it clean 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:03:01.220
 b 3 and let the queen be now by supporting the bishop 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:06.709
 Say I can take and portability me Ssu gun but black and legislation in the not equal here 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:09.390
 Together Te in the resulting in a loss to you white and would here Quinn escapes established 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.050
 I would like to take f 7 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.390
 White 's of the queen after escaping with the proximal 7 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.180
 The point is that there are few places to escape Queen must support this day 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.000
 Because you must have in this lane 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.640
 It good and there is no point of Well d 5 because 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.750
 Since the x-point is covered by the light, it runs away with queen c 4, but it is black day 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:38.490
 Here's a b file when you're fine with this 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:43.440
 Sickle white queen is no longer a place to move in this lane 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.990
 I such of the so do not unless corn magma of Well c 2 9 d 3 Naa and Is the Sei' 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.160
 But 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.530
 If you take a bishop with a pin bottom 7 that there is no thing here 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.260
 It allows you to frame obtained 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:59.650
 So the above is a brief introduction to this scalar- less mate, and it was also a remedy 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.170
 Video is more in with the mate not from their nest 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.170
 Thank you for watching
