00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.900
 denise keel Holtz and hes rather somewhere in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.900
 the studio 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.680

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.030

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.260
 from daughter you have a round 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.940
 no number of things done or just 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.140
 straight to the formation studio 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.879
 be brutal sport separately 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.680
 of course also a special story 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.970
 let's start with the right sneeze 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.530
 kickboxing women than people think 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.690

 again just really nice fun 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 lady but that advantage you often come 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.280
 against people saying theirs 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.129
 kickboxers a bit weird 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.019
 yes they usually think of it as you had 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.880
 to fight as a woman and that afterwards 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.920
 also tell me as one outside the ring 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.760
 half-man download without the blow 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.580
 get it from your friend 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.840
 great song that is there too 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.850
 often said of course because that you 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.710
 expected from someone who has such a hefty and 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.270
 those who do sports quickly have a flat nose 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.520
 for example not afraid of that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.010
 and no no if you are afraid of that 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.540
 then it usually happens marijn this case 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.729
 no i am not afraid 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.799
 no you barbe afraid of the loss 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.140
 is actually the biggest fears for and 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.760
 fights at and the cia losing 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.260
 are you more or less the not really that 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.340
 you are afraid of it but you are there 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.290
 working on it 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.600
 shake every match and the mojo 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.830
 nothing new in between 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.750
 hear big 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.010
 you fought guang earlier this year 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.890
 and you were not satisfied with that 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.770
 try it from the trainer i must have 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.350
 a final result was already that is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.550
 fight off best verse in the world 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 and so basically just a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.590
 gift I had to unpack but went 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.360
 at the first t all errors 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.920
 from then on I just knew I have to 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.180
 just go change into something it was 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.160
 a difficult choice 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.440
 yeah say i mean let that i have the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.020
 show crich the heron 11 years together until 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.090
 we really have to be the best 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.950
 things just put my own head together 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.320
 in my career so was really love and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.540
 remove trunks 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.610
 in retrospect has an important and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.989
 degree good choice of glass but how 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.760
 It actually comes to you that you are too good 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.800
 nothing is a trick for you to train 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.900
 just harder the other 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.330
 I have no idea I just think anyway 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.190
 hard and well i just really have one 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.019
 right people me i have very good ones 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.630
 trainer had it at cramp 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.370
 look my had to jim in Amsterdam and well 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.230
 yes for the rest i just have in my 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.420
 family we are very important to me 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.459

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.450
 everything in me yes what is around me 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.540
 complete 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.739
 I've been undefeated for four years now 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.150
 just always runs well 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.860
 so you are a clean something 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.420
 different 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.579
 Of course you will not become a world champion 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.049
 you just grab something like that 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.269
 you started with judo 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.790

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.470

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.450

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.849
 myself green and not teaching yo either 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.290
 I still do that myself 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.930
 judo I do not 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.489
 yes you see going to america is right because 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.739
 consider what earn at the actually 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.310
 because are you going for greenhouses or are you going here now 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.480
 weather 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.069
 but just normal way just to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.019
 events become day I organized 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.030
 just get in the netherlands and and ah dude 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.319
 in a permanent for just to america 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.720
 of a question 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.549
 acclimatize afterwards then you have a party 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.030
 and you two go hunting and then you go 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.400
 back 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.049
 you are half egyptian correct and that is 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.849
 here father's side lars the windows 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.380
 what is often thought of them 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.980
 we Surinamese this is not someone like that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.500
 amplification 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.000
 yes and hard to turn his on and off 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.599
 but you also feel yes or yes 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.220
 not 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.680

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.040
 well i could feel country everything before 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.730
 that's just your pride 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.120
 just for my head to myself 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.489
 there are so many Dutch but in 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.390
 a cycle I just have something special 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.639
 and a 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.979
 there is never a woman so indian kim 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.479
 bugs are the basis of the first 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.479
 the number oil that are variety
