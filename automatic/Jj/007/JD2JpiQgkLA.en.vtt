00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
restaurant and not pay and perhaps she

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.929 
restaurant and not pay and perhaps she
was<00:01:46.479> following<00:01:46.659> him<00:01:47.049> for<00:01:47.079> payment<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:48.789> was

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
processed at this time I think he's

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.480 
processed at this time I think he's
actually<00:04:20.150> carjacking<00:04:20.930> her<00:04:21.109> so<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.709> grabbed<00:04:22.190> his

tells him to get in and I recognized at
that<00:04:34.850> moment<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.560> she's<00:04:36.560> she's<00:04:36.980> part<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.280> it

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that moment that she's she's part of it

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.690 
that moment that she's she's part of it
did<00:04:38.210> there<00:04:38.390> together<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.440> she<00:04:39.830> speeds<00:04:40.430> off

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
did there together so she speeds off

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.580 
did there together so she speeds off
have<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.240> let<00:04:41.390> go<00:04:41.419> because<00:04:41.750> she<00:04:42.020> accelerates

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
have to let go because she accelerates

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.620 
have to let go because she accelerates
to<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> vehicle<00:04:43.250> she<00:04:43.790> speeds<00:04:44.090> off<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.540> goes

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
to the vehicle she speeds off and goes

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.870 
to the vehicle she speeds off and goes
through<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.020> stop<00:04:45.590> light<00:04:45.890> intersection<00:04:46.400> it's

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
through the stop light intersection it's

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.020 
through the stop light intersection it's
actually<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.240> red<00:04:47.870> light<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.290> she<00:04:48.440> runs<00:04:48.590> and

actually a red light that she runs and

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.640 
actually a red light that she runs and
all<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.090> could<00:04:50.360> think<00:04:50.480> of<00:04:50.750> was<00:04:50.810> I've<00:04:51.350> come<00:04:51.590> this

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
all I could think of was I've come this

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.190 
all I could think of was I've come this
far<00:04:51.860> he<00:04:52.490> was<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:52.790> close<00:04:53.120> where<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.630> cops<00:04:53.810> you

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
far he was so close where the cops you

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.470 
far he was so close where the cops you
know<00:04:54.230> waiting<00:04:54.560> for<00:04:54.800> them<00:04:54.919> to<00:04:54.950> arrive<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.640> I

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
know waiting for them to arrive and I

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.420 
know waiting for them to arrive and I
knew<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.470> had<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.680> follow<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.040> vehicles

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
knew that I had to follow the vehicles

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.940 
knew that I had to follow the vehicles
so<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:58.790> ran<00:04:59.330> through<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.870> red<00:05:00.050> intersection

happened and i would like to think that

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.790 
happened and i would like to think that
i<00:05:50.740> wouldn't<00:05:51.630> because<00:05:52.630> when<00:05:53.169> i<00:05:53.199> looked<00:05:53.650> at<00:05:53.770> it

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
i wouldn't because when i looked at it

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.439 
i wouldn't because when i looked at it
in<00:05:53.979> retrospect<00:05:54.639> i<00:05:54.789> realized<00:05:55.240> what<00:05:55.419> a

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
in retrospect i realized what a

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.450 
in retrospect i realized what a
dangerous<00:05:55.810> situation<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.560> put<00:05:56.770> myself<00:05:56.889> in<00:05:57.250> I

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
dangerous situation I put myself in I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.089 
dangerous situation I put myself in I
had<00:05:58.150> no<00:05:58.330> point<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:59.020> that<00:05:59.169> moment<00:05:59.500> when<00:05:59.860> I<00:05:59.889> was

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
had no point in that moment when I was

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.700 
had no point in that moment when I was
doing<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:00.580> was<00:06:00.729> in<00:06:00.880> fear<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.270> my<00:06:01.539> life<00:06:02.110> or<00:06:02.650> my

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
doing it was in fear of my life or my

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.510 
doing it was in fear of my life or my
safety<00:06:03.250> however<00:06:04.240> I<00:06:05.199> have<00:06:05.530> two<00:06:05.949> children<00:06:06.159> and

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
safety however I have two children and

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.409 
safety however I have two children and
my<00:06:06.699> first<00:06:07.080> responsibility<00:06:08.080> is<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.650> them<00:06:09.009> and

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
my first responsibility is to them and

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.559 
my first responsibility is to them and
looking<00:06:10.419> back<00:06:10.750> on<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:11.020> I<00:06:11.440> just<00:06:11.889> think<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:12.970> I

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
looking back on it I just think that I

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.470 
looking back on it I just think that I
probably<00:06:14.440> wouldn't<00:06:15.009> have<00:06:15.039> taken<00:06:15.280> that<00:06:15.460> risk

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
probably wouldn't have taken that risk

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.500 
probably wouldn't have taken that risk
I<00:06:16.600> shouldn't<00:06:17.230> have<00:06:17.350> taken<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.740> risk<00:06:17.830> as<00:06:18.040> a<00:06:18.070> mom

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
I shouldn't have taken the risk as a mom

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.100 
I shouldn't have taken the risk as a mom
and<00:06:19.920> I<00:06:20.920> just<00:06:21.370> was<00:06:21.640> with<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.390> moment<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:22.960> know

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
and I just was with the moment you know

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.560 
and I just was with the moment you know
there<00:06:23.410> was<00:06:23.500> something<00:06:24.310> went<00:06:24.700> wrong<00:06:24.880> and<00:06:25.300> I

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
there was something went wrong and I

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.810 
there was something went wrong and I
felt<00:06:25.870> that<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.200> needed<00:06:26.230> I<00:06:26.860> needed<00:06:27.430> there

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
felt that it needed I needed there

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.570 
felt that it needed I needed there
needed<00:06:28.060> to<00:06:28.090> be<00:06:28.150> justice<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:29.340> all<00:06:30.340> I<00:06:30.400> could

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
needed to be justice and all I could

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.190 
needed to be justice and all I could
think<00:06:30.700> of<00:06:31.000> was<00:06:31.210> making<00:06:31.570> sure<00:06:31.750> that<00:06:31.930> there<00:06:32.050> was

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
think of was making sure that there was

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.680 
think of was making sure that there was
justice<00:06:32.680> the<00:06:33.550> mom<00:06:33.820> and<00:06:33.850> me<00:06:34.090> probably<00:06:34.480> should

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
justice the mom and me probably should

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:43.230 
justice the mom and me probably should
have<00:06:34.750> been<00:06:34.870> a<00:06:34.900> little<00:06:35.050> more<00:06:35.230> cautious

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.430 

you

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.500
