the original one is there's a huge
difference<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.240> makes<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> other<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.990> look

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
difference it makes the other one look

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
difference it makes the other one look
like<00:02:04.439> freaking<00:02:04.920> gray<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:08.060> yeah

it a little bit but you can still tell

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.650 
it a little bit but you can still tell

pretty dense and it does get a little
bit<00:02:37.120> clumpy<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.430> usually<00:02:40.209> clean<00:02:40.599> off<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
bit clumpy so I usually clean off the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.880 
bit clumpy so I usually clean off the
tip<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:43.170> pretty<00:02:44.170> much<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> whole<00:02:44.590> brush

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
tip and pretty much the whole brush

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.650 
tip and pretty much the whole brush
because<00:02:45.280> otherwise<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:46.030> clumps<00:02:46.329> like<00:02:46.390> crazy

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
because otherwise it clumps like crazy

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.569 
because otherwise it clumps like crazy
and<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.110> one<00:02:50.670> looks<00:02:51.670> over<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:53.799> like

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
and for this one looks over but I like

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.360 
and for this one looks over but I like
the<00:02:54.819> way<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.750> shaped<00:02:56.190> more<00:02:57.190> than

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
the way that this is shaped more than

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.190 
the way that this is shaped more than
the<00:02:57.489> other<00:02:57.670> one<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.930> kind<00:02:59.170> of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the other one just because it's kind of

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.100 
the other one just because it's kind of
like<00:02:59.260> an<00:02:59.500> hourglass<00:03:00.190> shape<00:03:00.390> it's<00:03:01.390> bigger<00:03:01.810> than

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
like an hourglass shape it's bigger than

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.930 
like an hourglass shape it's bigger than
it<00:03:02.170> gets<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.590> little<00:03:02.890> bit<00:03:03.340> thinner<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
it gets a little bit thinner in the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.800 
it gets a little bit thinner in the
center<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.599> then<00:03:04.810> bigger<00:03:05.620> again<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.810> like

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
center and then bigger again so I like

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.080 
center and then bigger again so I like
that<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.470> gives<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.519> little<00:03:09.700> bit<00:03:09.910> more

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
that it gives it a little bit more

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.589 
that it gives it a little bit more
volume

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
volume

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.460 
volume
I<00:03:10.810> think<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:12.610> helps<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.180> get<00:03:13.900> those<00:03:14.109> kind

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I think and it helps to get those kind

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.530 
I think and it helps to get those kind
of<00:03:14.530> shorter<00:03:14.920> lashes<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.639> bottom<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.359> a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
of shorter lashes on the bottom and a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.280 
of shorter lashes on the bottom and a
little<00:03:16.569> bit<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.739> top<00:03:17.980> okay<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.139> I'm<00:03:20.139> going

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
little bit on the top okay so I'm going

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.289 
little bit on the top okay so I'm going
to<00:03:20.410> zoom<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.950> on<00:03:21.069> this<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:24.310> I'm<00:03:24.609> going<00:03:24.849> to<00:03:25.030> curl

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
to zoom in on this and I'm going to curl

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.699 
to zoom in on this and I'm going to curl
up<00:03:25.569> my<00:03:25.870> lashes<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:28.239> I'm<00:03:28.540> going<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.079> start<00:03:29.500> off

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
up my lashes so I'm going to start off

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.220 
up my lashes so I'm going to start off
with<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.190> original<00:03:30.880> voluminous<00:03:31.510> carbon

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
with the original voluminous carbon

00:03:32.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
with the original voluminous carbon
black<00:03:32.440> and

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.900 

all<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.460> so<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.670> like<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.270> got<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.510> little<00:04:11.810> bit

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
all right so I like it got a little bit

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.910 
all right so I like it got a little bit
messy<00:04:13.910> but<00:04:14.890> through<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.280> okay<00:04:17.800> cuz<00:04:18.800> I

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
messy but through that is okay cuz I

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.160 
messy but through that is okay cuz I
don't<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.280> any<00:04:20.320> eyeshadow<00:04:21.320> on<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.660> I'm<00:04:23.660> not

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
don't have any eyeshadow on so I'm not

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.920 
don't have any eyeshadow on so I'm not
really<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:25.340> big<00:04:25.670> fan<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.030> how<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.480> applies<00:04:26.750> on

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
really a big fan of how it applies on

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.870 
really a big fan of how it applies on
the<00:04:27.020> bottom<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:27.620> looks<00:04:28.010> really<00:04:28.100> sloppy

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
the bottom it just looks really sloppy

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.860 
the bottom it just looks really sloppy
and<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:30.230> think<00:04:30.830> it's<00:04:31.040> because<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:32.000> brush<00:04:32.360> is

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
and I think it's because the brush is

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.730 
and I think it's because the brush is
just<00:04:32.930> kind<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.860> thick<00:04:34.340> throughout<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.780> it

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
just kind of thick throughout and it

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.910 
just kind of thick throughout and it
doesn't<00:04:37.100> apply<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.640> very<00:04:38.260> evenly<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.590> kind<00:04:39.830> of

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
doesn't apply it very evenly and kind of

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.450 
doesn't apply it very evenly and kind of
sparsely<00:04:40.520> on<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.000> bottom<00:04:41.560> so<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:43.010> tend<00:04:43.310> to

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
sparsely on the bottom so I just tend to

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.490 
sparsely on the bottom so I just tend to
use<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> smaller<00:04:44.090> brush<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.630> go<00:04:44.750> over<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.260> to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
use a smaller brush and go over it to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.450 
use a smaller brush and go over it to
just<00:04:45.800> make<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.760> little<00:04:46.910> bit<00:04:47.120> thicker<00:04:47.450> so<00:04:48.460> I'm

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
just make it a little bit thicker so I'm

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.310 
just make it a little bit thicker so I'm
going<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.630> other<00:04:50.810> eye<00:04:51.160> with<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.640> ultra

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
going to do the other eye with the ultra

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:35.680 
going to do the other eye with the ultra
volume<00:04:55.900> collagen<00:04:57.820> blackest<00:04:58.820> black

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.310 

so<00:05:36.690> there's<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.440> two<00:05:37.650> eyes<00:05:37.860> compared<00:05:39.320> the

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
so there's the two eyes compared the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.650 
so there's the two eyes compared the
only<00:05:40.650> difference<00:05:41.130> for<00:05:41.430> me<00:05:41.640> is<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.090> this<00:05:42.360> one

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
only difference for me is that this one

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.020 
only difference for me is that this one
looks<00:05:43.440> a<00:05:43.560> little<00:05:43.590> bit<00:05:43.950> more<00:05:44.130> black<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.820> this

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
looks a little bit more black and this

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.450 
looks a little bit more black and this
one<00:05:45.240> has<00:05:45.420> just<00:05:45.720> a<00:05:45.870> little<00:05:46.110> bit<00:05:46.320> more<00:05:46.590> volume<00:05:46.920> on

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
one has just a little bit more volume on

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.720 
one has just a little bit more volume on
the<00:05:47.880> outer<00:05:48.060> edge<00:05:48.680> other<00:05:49.680> than<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.280> they're

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
the outer edge other than that they're

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.480 
the outer edge other than that they're
almost<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.690> same<00:05:51.720> they<00:05:52.500> both<00:05:52.530> have<00:05:52.950> pros<00:05:53.250> and

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
almost the same they both have pros and

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.670 
almost the same they both have pros and
cons<00:05:53.700> but<00:05:54.120> I<00:05:54.150> do<00:05:54.270> have<00:05:54.540> to<00:05:54.690> mention<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:55.230> huge

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
cons but I do have to mention a huge

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.320 
cons but I do have to mention a huge
huge<00:05:56.130> comment<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.670> this<00:05:56.850> one

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.010 
your lashes so if you're really
sensitive<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.340> smells<00:06:21.120> I<00:06:21.480> wouldn't<00:06:21.750> recommend

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
sensitive to smells I wouldn't recommend

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.290 
sensitive to smells I wouldn't recommend
that<00:06:22.320> one<00:06:22.530> but<00:06:22.920> I<00:06:23.130> can<00:06:23.490> kind<00:06:23.640> of<00:06:23.760> deal<00:06:23.940> with<00:06:24.150> it

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
that one but I can kind of deal with it

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.290 
that one but I can kind of deal with it
I<00:06:24.390> just<00:06:24.620> try<00:06:25.620> not<00:06:25.650> to<00:06:26.070> breathe<00:06:26.880> out<00:06:27.060> of<00:06:27.090> my<00:06:27.210> nose

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
I just try not to breathe out of my nose

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.380 
I just try not to breathe out of my nose
I<00:06:27.690> guess<00:06:27.930> but<00:06:28.640> I'm<00:06:29.640> going<00:06:29.850> to<00:06:29.910> show<00:06:30.060> you<00:06:30.120> what

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
I guess but I'm going to show you what

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.909 
I guess but I'm going to show you what
they<00:06:30.510> look<00:06:30.690> like<00:06:30.720> when<00:06:30.990> I<00:06:31.020> mix<00:06:31.350> them<00:06:31.650> together

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
they look like when I mix them together

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:57.410 
they look like when I mix them together
so

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.720 

so<00:06:58.410> you<00:06:58.650> can<00:06:58.800> definitely<00:06:59.400> tell<00:06:59.640> the

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
so you can definitely tell the

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.320 
so you can definitely tell the
difference<00:06:59.760> now<00:07:01.460> so<00:07:02.460> I'm<00:07:02.580> going<00:07:02.850> to<00:07:03.000> quickly

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
difference now so I'm going to quickly

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:17.750 
difference now so I'm going to quickly
put<00:07:03.540> this<00:07:03.960> one<00:07:04.200> order<00:07:04.680> my<00:07:05.550> left<00:07:05.820> eye

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.630 

so<00:07:18.760> I<00:07:19.290> like<00:07:20.290> the<00:07:20.470> way<00:07:20.590> that<00:07:20.800> this<00:07:20.950> one<00:07:21.190> looks<00:07:21.430> a

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640 
so I like the way that this one looks a

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.300 
so I like the way that this one looks a
lot<00:07:21.820> more<00:07:22.060> it<00:07:22.180> just<00:07:22.240> looks<00:07:22.600> more<00:07:23.310> feathered

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
lot more it just looks more feathered

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.190 
lot more it just looks more feathered
out<00:07:24.610> on<00:07:26.400> edge<00:07:27.400> and<00:07:28.030> I<00:07:28.390> don't<00:07:28.540> know<00:07:28.720> I<00:07:28.750> just<00:07:29.050> like

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.200

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
the way it looks it makes it really

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.530 
the way it looks it makes it really
thick

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:31.540 
thick
