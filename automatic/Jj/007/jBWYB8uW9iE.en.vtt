I<00:00:00.469> put<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> beating<00:00:01.740> down<00:00:01.949> on<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.399> Miz<00:00:03.290> all

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
I put a beating down on the Miz all

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.480 
I put a beating down on the Miz all
right<00:00:04.440> so<00:00:04.529> let's<00:00:04.650> talk<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.950> little<00:00:05.040> bit<00:00:05.279> about

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
right so let's talk a little bit about

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.249 
right so let's talk a little bit about
with<00:00:05.790> our<00:00:05.940> expert<00:00:06.299> panel<00:00:06.600> here<00:00:06.720> we<00:00:06.839> got<00:00:06.960> Bret

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
with our expert panel here we got Bret

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.350 
with our expert panel here we got Bret
Hart<00:00:12.320> this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.500> not<00:00:13.740> realistic<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> not

advances<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.300> learn<00:00:19.520> somehow<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:21.210> way<00:00:21.240> he

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
advances to learn somehow some way he

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.080 
advances to learn somehow some way he
figured<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.250> make<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.460> even<00:00:24.029> more

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
figured out a way to make this even more

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.800 
figured out a way to make this even more
mile<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.760> pink<00:00:26.760> again<00:00:26.970> accommodate<00:00:27.779> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
mile now what pink again accommodate a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:38.689 
mile now what pink again accommodate a
little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> match

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.740 

hey<00:00:39.699> mrs.<00:00:40.180> I<00:00:40.449> 189<00:00:41.170> looks<00:00:41.410> like<00:00:42.510> squeeze<00:00:43.510> here

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
hey mrs. I 189 looks like squeeze here

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.270 
hey mrs. I 189 looks like squeeze here
we<00:00:43.930> go<00:00:44.190> oh<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:46.409> don't<00:00:47.409> know<00:00:47.530> if<00:00:47.649> that<00:00:47.800> I<00:00:47.980> don't<00:00:48.129> ya

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
we go oh I don't know if that I don't ya

we go oh I don't know if that I don't ya
Justin<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.089> don't<00:00:49.269> think<00:00:49.449> he's<00:00:49.600> bumped<00:00:49.930> up<00:00:50.019> to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
Justin I don't think he's bumped up to

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.439 
Justin I don't think he's bumped up to
189<00:00:50.530> that's<00:00:51.339> like<00:00:51.579> maybe<00:00:51.850> it's<00:00:52.000> just<00:00:52.089> a<00:00:52.269> 9

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
189 that's like maybe it's just a 9

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.560 
189 that's like maybe it's just a 9
maybe<00:00:53.320> you're<00:00:53.500> just<00:00:53.649> as<00:00:54.339> Bret<00:00:54.670> Hart<00:00:55.030> have<00:00:55.299> high

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
maybe you're just as Bret Hart have high

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.979 
maybe you're just as Bret Hart have high
of<00:00:55.750> 89<00:00:56.879> Brett<00:00:57.879> actually<00:00:58.210> has<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.360> 10<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.780> have<00:00:58.960> a

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
of 89 Brett actually has a 10 you have a

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:11.160 
of 89 Brett actually has a 10 you have a
9<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.070> Corey<00:01:09.340> obviously<00:01:09.789> matters<00:01:10.179> and<00:01:10.570> ladders

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
9 so Corey obviously matters and ladders

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.840 
9 so Corey obviously matters and ladders
and<00:01:11.350> tables<00:01:11.710> are<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.860> big<00:01:12.069> feature<00:01:12.310> this<00:01:12.670> year

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
and tables are a big feature this year

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.399 
and tables are a big feature this year
there's<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.179> gym<00:01:13.390> right<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:13.840> let's<00:01:14.229> talk<00:01:14.350> a

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
there's a gym right so let's talk a

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.499 
there's a gym right so let's talk a
little<00:01:14.500> bit<00:01:14.740> about<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.399> head<00:01:15.580> yeah<00:01:16.060> this<00:01:16.360> is

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
little bit about the head yeah this is

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.270 
little bit about the head yeah this is
the<00:01:16.630> angle<00:01:17.050> eyes<00:01:17.319> and<00:01:17.530> chairs<00:01:17.740> match<00:01:17.830> right

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
the angle eyes and chairs match right

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.279 
the angle eyes and chairs match right
here<00:01:18.310> like<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.179> talked<00:01:19.420> about<00:01:19.509> his<00:01:19.750> awesome<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
here like I talked about his awesome the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.109 
here like I talked about his awesome the
physics<00:01:20.649> lab<00:01:20.800> working<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.340> tables<00:01:21.700> break<00:01:21.909> in

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
physics lab working the tables break in

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.690 
physics lab working the tables break in
to<00:01:22.270> see<00:01:22.450> different<00:01:23.140> ways<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.679> missile<00:01:24.280> Tyson

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
to see different ways the missile Tyson

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.430 
to see different ways the missile Tyson
is<00:01:24.789> fizzy<00:01:25.030> Jason<00:01:25.569> should<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:25.960> create<00:01:26.259> some

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
is fizzy Jason should just create some

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.559 
is fizzy Jason should just create some
big<00:01:26.710> matches<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.610> headlock<00:01:27.970> just<00:01:28.330> like<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
big matches the headlock just like the

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.300 
big matches the headlock just like the
TLC<00:01:28.840> matches<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.590> see<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.860> know<00:01:30.009> girls

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
TLC matches that you see you know girls

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.480 
TLC matches that you see you know girls
over<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.610> programming<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.220> think<00:01:33.280> I'm

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
over the programming so I think I'm

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.609 
over the programming so I think I'm
handicapping<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.299> I'm<00:01:34.840> handicapping<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
handicapping you I'm handicapping you a

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.139 
handicapping you I'm handicapping you a
little<00:01:35.890> bit<00:01:36.009> here<00:01:36.220> because<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:36.580> got<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.970> talk

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
little bit here because you got to talk

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.369 
little bit here because you got to talk
and<00:01:37.300> play<00:01:37.450> at<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.539> same<00:01:37.629> time<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.080> Miz<00:01:38.229> is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:38.379 
and play at the same time the Miz is

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.479 
and play at the same time the Miz is
coming<00:01:38.679> back<00:01:41.099> respect<00:01:42.099> should<00:01:42.250> have<00:01:42.369> been<00:01:42.459> a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:42.489 
coming back respect should have been a

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.040 
coming back respect should have been a
double<00:01:42.819> count-out<00:01:44.580> all<00:01:45.580> right<00:01:45.879> what<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.840> night

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
double count-out all right what a night

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.930 
double count-out all right what a night
it's<00:01:47.229> been<00:01:47.319> here<00:01:47.470> at<00:01:47.739> SummerSlam<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.610> give<00:01:48.910> it

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
it's been here at SummerSlam and give it
