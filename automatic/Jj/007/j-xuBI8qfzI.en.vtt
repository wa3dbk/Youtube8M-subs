 shampoo conditioner products tonic for 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 scalp and wax for modeling 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.680
 of our hairstyles I'll start with shampoo from 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.109
 air conditioner 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.770
 I will tell you that this shampoo 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.899
 I liked the little gray jar 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 immediately from the first application of love 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.489
 first look at first use 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 I haven't had anything like you for quite a while 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 did you know it was blond and hair 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.850
 we of course were very terrible 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.190
 straw conditions 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.190
 everyone who saw me live can it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.239
 confirm literally from the first 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.300
 applying how i applied this shampoo and 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.370
 subsequently air conditioner, I realized that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 my hair is absolutely normal on 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 the length of the length that I already have 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 has grown back 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.610
 and literally to the tips my length 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 there is such a good beautiful 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 and the tips were just incredible 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 terrible amid such a good length 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.119
 I immediately ran the next day 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 literally or every other day 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.350
 hairdresser trim the tips though 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.020
 and the axes didn't want to do this I struggled 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.560
 literally for every inch of their 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.540
 hair 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.000
 that grow them now 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.640
 pretty hard but after i 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.280
 I realized that I have a length 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.060
 She and tips very stand out on 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.530
 this background 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.030
 it was necessary to bring the hair in order 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.680
 Now there are many people who 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.810
 again see me live they 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.810
 noted that my hair is finally 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.750
 acquired a human species here they are 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.880
 I push the plaintiff I absolutely no way 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.800
 I am putting in nothing so that all these 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.930
 styling products once again their not 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.020
 I use overdrying the third 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.750
 month by the way the pattern is pretty such as 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.119
 economical and air conditioning is also here by 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.410
 200 80 milliliters is not enough before 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.440
 the end of the year is exactly what I said 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.620
 right away I saw the results for me it is very 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.720
 liked it once I had a head i didn't 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.209
 I noticed what bottle I take because 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 that they are absolutely identical and random 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.820
 I took the air conditioner and washed it 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
 head exactly the air conditioning process 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.510
 washing could not understand why i have 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.850
 the shampoo suddenly stopped foaming what 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.459
 happened but everything was fine hair was 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.640
 beautiful very had such a nice view 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.070
 the only thing that I myself next 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.180
 day I wanted to wash my hair well or there 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.910
 a day later, the aggravation had to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.579
 head wash only with air conditioning or 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.340
 washed than when we use 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.560
 shampoo still with shampoo head wash 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.600
 better i recently found out what turns out to be 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.860
 salons also have such a procedure when 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.049
 you only wash my head with air conditioning 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.570
 Here is a still happens in 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.360
 This line has a scalp tonic 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.459
 what was it so interesting to me 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.799
 In my manual it says what you need 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.870
 use this tonic either 1 week 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.570
 whether twice a week now i'm 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.870
 used 1 week 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.390
 here you need to separate the hair into partings and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.660
 on the partings put it tonic and rub 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.880
 in the scalp it seems to me it's all the same 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.830
 to moisten a thin like at 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.480
 spoka fleece 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.180
 same head and to be honest he is a little bit 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.860
 has some put on the bare effect 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.120
 he does not give the amount of such a check 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.310
 radical and they are not a fan of volumes 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.710
 so basically i can't say that 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.300
 with this thing you make yourself and 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.460
 radical volume is not really 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.670
 this will not be but a little womb 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.710
 squirrels attached I already forgot what is 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.290
 teeth become and scalp 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.930
 i don't like wax at all 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.080
 to model our hairstyles like this 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.780
 looks like a jar when you open the lid 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:19.870
 we see this white 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.580
 gost as you show in general pretty 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.240
 interesting thing if you do 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.760
 some styling some curls 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.590
 some waves but I'm still short 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.530
 and hair for this reason I literally 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.070
 used it a couple of times now 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.720
 I do not have that period when I especially do 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.970
 My hairstyles because I have now 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.370
 such a haircut that just washed her hair 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.540
 combed and went and already waiting when u 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.200
 my hair will grow back 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.350
 more and I'll have fun there already 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.180
 complete program but I have a doll 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.290
 which I did hair and I'm on it 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.270
 trained in principle and that 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.640
 beautifully I did it like her 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.710
 hair so on my hair so in 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.919
 In principle, I think that on any hair 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.480
 the cart will hold well the only thing 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.610
 I would not recommend you too 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.640
 get involved in styling them means 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.890
 because they dry up our such you 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.350
 so they have a sadness 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.570
 i know i am here puppies that can't 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.850
 live and day without styling tools and 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.710
 this wax is very good on par with 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.689
 professional brands that is 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.299
 my accustomed to us 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.229
 on the shelves of professional stores 

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:31.209
 for hairdressers 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.580
 so, in principle, I can safely 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.479
 recommend I really liked 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.719
 this series 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.539
 I even regretted that I used to 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.289
 did not use anything absolutely from the brand 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.139
 m-way 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.569
 I have a huge number of friends 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.189
 enjoyed but somehow my hands 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.809
 did not reach me it seemed something very 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.059
 very expensive and somehow this is not for 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.849
 I still we grow 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:57.969
 we are changing some priorities and 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.399
 Now I think that hair is better 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:03.219
 More expensive here honestly I tried very 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:05.499
 a lot of mars to homemade which 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.749
 I have my hair in a mask 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:11.169
 mustard is very out and dried 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:13.199
 hair though i understand what i need 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.989
 put on hair roots but when i 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:20.259
 twisted it all under the bag got 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:22.449
 my length came under the mustard and when I 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.659
 bag already removed I discovered that I 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.579
 it's all dry there and here 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.679
 This series somehow restored to me 

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:31.839
 somehow led to my human species 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:36.749
 hair that hair can be killed even without 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:39.669
 painting even the seemingly so 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:41.499
 innocent quite mask well that's all 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.360
 don't even know what to add really 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:45.399
 I like these products 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.809
 great pleasure I want to learn from 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:49.089
 did you use you 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:51.339
 site no one you liked what is not 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:54.099
 that he came that no write 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:57.759
 surely in the comments I will be everything 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:01.269
 read and discuss with you if you suddenly 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:03.579
 have any questions about this topic 

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:04.599
 Well, today, see you in 

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:07.800
