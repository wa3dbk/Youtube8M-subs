00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:12.059
 It was here, people are saying, what are you talking about? 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.889
 half a pound and welcome everyone to the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.830
 my first video of missing a bus 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.520
 Tell me where I'm really playing. 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.680
 folks 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.570
 all the other games I was playing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.880
 Bringing you guys were gringos. 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.189
 were already in the game and participating in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.680
 a kind of closed beta and the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.750
 privileged big lucky that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 they managed to play this game with more than 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.200
 one month in advance and we only 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.480
 sucking on him, huh? 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 and I confess to you that I was not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.879
 very excited about the future 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 goals 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.649
 I played enough already it multiplayer mode 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.190
 I'm about eight hours from 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 gameplay tono level 19 almost take 20 already 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.590
 it takes a lot for you to level up 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.690
 well ros cadu for you to evolve 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 I think in the mean time of eight 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 I was one of the runners already 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.109
 I was there in the light 1 35 at about the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 season is much faster and if that 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 It takes much longer for the pa 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 This is cool because it caters to a 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.420
 longevity bigger but I'll talk more 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.189
 of these things in other videos 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.830
 video here to really bring you the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.150
 first 500 trick game on the channel 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 You must be wondering halfway. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.330
 But what the hell did I do? 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.000
 Well, my face, I was staying too. 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 half in doubt because when the game was played 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.729
 announced that it is strange that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 called the dinc as if it were the moab of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.250
 module was 3 only in the final version of the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.460
 game they ended up changing the name of the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 Odin strike for those who draw then 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.060
 basically when you take what is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.030
 strange that you loose and finish 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.530
 exploding killing everyone - you're the one 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.250
 Same mobi thing 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 but there's a cool thing to do in the strike 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.040
 in the safe goals has two forms the way 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.619
 hardcore to catch that where you have it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.979
 who kill 25 enemies and you can 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.560
 pick it up straight and then you'll finally call it 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.930
 Nothing, everyone, for the bitch who gave birth to him. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.450
 It takes the form of a club to catch it 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.790
 is the form of the case being repaired which 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.420
 In this game you have the suitcase and every time 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.590
 what do you pick up the suitcase 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.940
 has random objectives this objective 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.760
 random goals as you 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.750
 Are you going to do it? 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.270
 Stress is also random and between 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.600
 these random kits can come what is 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.819
 strike and then you can trigger your 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.270
 mobi is that this is the first time I 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.610
 I get it and it triggers to it I already had 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.830
 gotta get on another map too 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.019
 but the box stayed on top of the roof 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.940
 I got pissed from life I could not 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.459
 catch on and gave a rage 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.519
 damn because most maps do 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.540
 the heat and ghost only a little closed 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.090
 Something like that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.980
 Then there's a map that's fucking map that the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.620
 support still not good and you're ready 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.660
 get release that does not strike is 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.370
 very complicated since you need to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.290
 pick it up at the base of the box you 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.500
 they noticed the cache appeared when 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.150
 meet the rms goal it here appears 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 Little pink do not know if the whole 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.080
 little pink po box or is not the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.120
 rosinha right and beauty flag is 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.620
 I'll see you there, I'll lie down, I'll stay there. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.109
 very afraid because the box rolled in 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.180
 me and luckily did not kill and 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.940
 You are seeing field attack because the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.769
 It's all in Portuguese, but if you 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.019
 have played the game in english will 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.970
 appear that destroys and is very cool 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.400
 countdown begins and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.489
 basically going to blow the whole scene 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.380
 It's just a very fucking effect and the cool one that 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.239
 was playing on the street zone map and 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.970
 this is the only map of the game that when 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.829
 You call what on strike it ends. 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.510
 modifying the scenery you can see 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.030
 The whole scene is destroyed. 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.970
 with that is that mean snow 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.410
 This is a very 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.660
 cool, very different 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.640
 in other maps times does not end the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.829
 any type of deformation occurs in the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.459
 scenery but this mist means 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.290
 reddish such is and appears also then 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.150
 is the same scheme the engine was 36 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.700
 called the habit, heaven was half 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.859
 Orange and red means is that it 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.269
 also has a small modification 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.700
 I thought people hope you have 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.930
 tanned gameplay this is my first one 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.789
 It's strange that it went well. 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.300
 I quickly want to see if I can get the 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.260
 who strike hardcore player 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.640
 Then there are six for you. 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.660
 thank you very much for the 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.100
 company and we see each other 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.100
