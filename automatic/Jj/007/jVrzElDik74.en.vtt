00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the more authentic but it's more like

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
the more authentic but it's more like
what<00:00:33.899> name<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.380> choose<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.340> whether<00:00:35.640> or

only<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.129> Koreans<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.850> maybe<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.079> appeal<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
only for Koreans or maybe to appeal to

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.330

New<00:00:41.879> Yorkers<00:00:42.390> who<00:00:42.600> want<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> Korean<00:00:43.620> experience

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
New Yorkers who want a Korean experience

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.130 
New Yorkers who want a Korean experience

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it seems more like a deliberate choice

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
it seems more like a deliberate choice
and<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.309> about<00:00:47.520> survival<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.329> these

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and it's about survival because these

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
and it's about survival because these
places<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.500> probably<00:00:49.890> expensive<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.700> rent

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850

a sunday morning huh it's not that big

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.770 
a sunday morning huh it's not that big
it's<00:01:06.860> just<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:07.190> one<00:01:07.490> street<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.300> just<00:01:08.570> has<00:01:08.750> a

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
it's just this one street it just has a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.700 
it's just this one street it just has a
few<00:01:08.930> shops<00:01:10.360> pretty<00:01:11.360> much<00:01:11.570> just<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:12.020> necessities

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
few shops pretty much just a necessities

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.280 
few shops pretty much just a necessities
like<00:01:12.860> grocery<00:01:13.490> store<00:01:13.760> bookstore<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.750> don't

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
like grocery store bookstore I don't

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.750 
like grocery store bookstore I don't
even<00:01:15.350> know<00:01:15.500> if<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.770> CD<00:01:15.979> store<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.490> still<00:01:16.610> open

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
even know if the CD store is still open

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.710 
even know if the CD store is still open
but

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.500 

I<00:01:19.810> think<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.710> reason<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.100> it's<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:21.790> small<00:01:22.240> is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
I think the reason that it's so small is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.490 
I think the reason that it's so small is
that<00:01:22.780> well<00:01:23.260> two<00:01:23.530> things<00:01:23.770> one<00:01:24.400> like<00:01:24.760> if<00:01:25.500> Koreans

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
that well two things one like if Koreans

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.330 
that well two things one like if Koreans
want<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.160> place<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.430> live<00:01:27.820> that's<00:01:28.120> very<00:01:28.450> Korean

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
want a place to live that's very Korean

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.520 
want a place to live that's very Korean
there's<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.430> lot<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.730> options<00:01:31.570> outside<00:01:32.020> of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
there's a lot of options outside of

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.130 
there's a lot of options outside of
Manhattan<00:01:33.100> like<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:33.700> New<00:01:33.820> Jersey

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
Manhattan like in New Jersey

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.570 
Manhattan like in New Jersey
that<00:01:36.740> are<00:01:36.890> more<00:01:37.250> like<00:01:37.610> real<00:01:37.850> Korean<00:01:38.270> towns<00:01:38.570> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
that are more like real Korean towns and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.820 
that are more like real Korean towns and
also<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.940> think<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.750> lot<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.080> Manhattan<00:01:42.710> in

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
also I think a lot of Manhattan in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.160 
also I think a lot of Manhattan in
general<00:01:43.310> has<00:01:43.580> what<00:01:43.970> Koreans<00:01:44.390> look<00:01:44.720> for<00:01:45.020> in

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
general has what Koreans look for in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.850 
general has what Koreans look for in
terms<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.530> shopping<00:01:46.159> food<00:01:47.080> so<00:01:48.080> they<00:01:48.650> don't

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
terms of shopping food so they don't

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.560 
terms of shopping food so they don't
really<00:01:49.130> need<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.400> be<00:01:49.550> limited<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:50.300> one

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
really need to be limited to this one

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.690
