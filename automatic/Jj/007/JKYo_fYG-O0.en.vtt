about<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.399> 399<00:01:51.380> versus<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> 499

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
about is this one is 399 versus the 499

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
about is this one is 399 versus the 499
originally<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.060> last<00:01:54.240> year<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
originally for the one last year and you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.469 
originally for the one last year and you
do<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> expandable<00:01:55.860> storage<00:01:56.479> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
do get the expandable storage it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
do get the expandable storage it
displays<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> same<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.920> processor

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
displays about the same the processor

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
displays about the same the processor
you<00:01:59.850> know<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.570> course<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you know of course it's going to be a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.139 
you know of course it's going to be a
little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.560> better<00:02:01.799> cameras<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.060> bit

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
little bit better cameras a little bit

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.690 
little bit better cameras a little bit
better<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.540> outside<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.579> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
better but outside of that it's kind of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.059 
better but outside of that it's kind of
like<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.560> much<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> same

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
like you know it's pretty much the same

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.680 
like you know it's pretty much the same
thing<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.429> mean<00:02:08.670> there's<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.239> too<00:02:09.300> much

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
thing I mean there's really not too much

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.380 
thing I mean there's really not too much
different<00:02:09.959> about<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.920> course<00:02:11.849> system<00:02:12.209> has

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
different about it of course system has

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.650 
different about it of course system has
ice<00:02:12.629> cream<00:02:12.930> sandwich<00:02:13.349> on

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
ice cream sandwich on

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.240 
ice cream sandwich on
but<00:02:13.840> because<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.590> know<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.830> TouchWiz

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
but because it's you know of TouchWiz

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.860 
but because it's you know of TouchWiz
you<00:02:15.490> really<00:02:15.700> don't<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.090> can't<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.630> tell

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
you really don't you can't really tell

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
you really don't you can't really tell
it<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.620> ice<00:02:17.830> cream<00:02:18.070> sandwich<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.550> mean<00:02:18.700> there<00:02:18.820> is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
it is ice cream sandwich I mean there is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.120 
it is ice cream sandwich I mean there is
some<00:02:19.120> things<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:20.110> they've<00:02:20.290> modified<00:02:20.500> not

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
some things that they've modified not

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.760 
some things that they've modified not
and<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.490> like<00:02:21.910> sometimes<00:02:22.630> honestly<00:02:23.470> some<00:02:23.740> of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
and I do like sometimes honestly some of

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.070 
and I do like sometimes honestly some of
the<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.060> modification<00:02:25.810> some<00:02:25.990> of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the you know the modification some of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.770 
the you know the modification some of
the<00:02:26.140> manufacturers<00:02:26.770> make<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.780> Android

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the manufacturers make to Android

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600 
the manufacturers make to Android
because<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.560> makes<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.920> easier<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.310> lot

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
because I think it makes it easier a lot

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.230 
because I think it makes it easier a lot
of<00:02:30.760> times<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:32.170> know<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.470> same<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:33.070> know

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
of times but you know the same you know

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.520 
of times but you know the same you know
making<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.390> same<00:02:34.600> good<00:02:34.810> point<00:02:35.080> about<00:02:35.170> it's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
making the same good point about it's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.000 
making the same good point about it's
like<00:02:35.710> this<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.280> 399<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:38.080> can<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> galaxy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
like this is 399 you can get the galaxy

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.850 
like this is 399 you can get the galaxy
tab<00:02:39.310> 7<00:02:40.060> inch<00:02:40.270> for<00:02:41.400> 249<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:44.740> know

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
tab 7 inch for 249 that is the you know

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.350 
tab 7 inch for 249 that is the you know
that<00:02:45.010> has<00:02:45.130> ice<00:02:45.310> cream<00:02:45.610> sandwich<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.270> as

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
that has ice cream sandwich on it as

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.750 
that has ice cream sandwich on it as
well<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.320> personally<00:02:47.860> think<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.220> too<00:02:48.550> you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
well and I personally think that too you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400 
well and I personally think that too you
know<00:02:48.880> i<00:02:48.910> think<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.420> better<00:02:49.630> buy<00:02:49.930> than<00:02:50.230> this

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
know i think is a better buy than this

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.530 
know i think is a better buy than this
one<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.860> i<00:02:51.340> say<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.610> because<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:52.510> know

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
one and i say that because you know

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.880 
one and i say that because you know
another<00:02:52.870> fact<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.350> they're<00:02:53.560> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.740> come

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
another fact is they're going to come

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.990 
another fact is they're going to come
out<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.190> galaxy<00:02:54.670> note<00:02:55.740> 10.1<00:02:56.740> too<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
out with the galaxy note 10.1 too and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.240 
out with the galaxy note 10.1 too and
that's<00:02:58.900> going<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.290> coming<00:02:59.500> out<00:02:59.710> soon<00:02:59.740> it's

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
that's going to be coming out soon it's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.470 
that's going to be coming out soon it's
going<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> be<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.820> think<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.240> going<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.390> be

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
going to be I think it's going to be

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.990 
going to be I think it's going to be
called<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.780> galaxy<00:03:02.230> tab<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:03.010> think<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
called the galaxy tab I think it's the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.900 
called the galaxy tab I think it's the
galaxy<00:03:04.480> note<00:03:04.510> 2<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:04.990> believe<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> 10.1

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
galaxy note 2 I believe but it's a 10.1

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.430 
galaxy note 2 I believe but it's a 10.1
inch<00:03:07.240> slate<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.780> gonna<00:03:07.900> look<00:03:08.020> just<00:03:08.080> like

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
inch slate and it's gonna look just like

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.500 
inch slate and it's gonna look just like
this<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:08.950> i<00:03:09.640> believe<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.150> going<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.480> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
this and i believe is going to have a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.450 
this and i believe is going to have a
quad-core<00:03:10.840> chip<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.740> obvious<00:03:12.130> i'm<00:03:12.250> sure

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
quad-core chip in and obvious i'm sure

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.120 
quad-core chip in and obvious i'm sure
to<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:12.700> more<00:03:13.030> expensive<00:03:13.530> but<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.860> know

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
to be more expensive but you know

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.950 
to be more expensive but you know
getting<00:03:15.370> back<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.880> one<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.150> mean<00:03:16.390> honestly

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
getting back to this one I mean honestly

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.320 
getting back to this one I mean honestly
if<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.709> play<00:03:17.980> with<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.280> last<00:03:18.490> galaxy<00:03:18.940> tab<00:03:19.150> and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
if you play with the last galaxy tab and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.380 
if you play with the last galaxy tab and
you<00:03:19.420> like<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> great<00:03:21.760> tablet<00:03:22.030> if

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
you like it this is a great tablet if

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.600 
you like it this is a great tablet if
you<00:03:22.570> like<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.959> from<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.650> aspect<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.490> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
you like it from that aspect of it the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.310 
you like it from that aspect of it the
other<00:03:24.760> point<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.240> it<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.450> though<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:25.870> not<00:03:25.930> a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
other point of it is though it's not a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.960 
other point of it is though it's not a
lot<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.530> change<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.340> really<00:03:27.790> couldn't

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
