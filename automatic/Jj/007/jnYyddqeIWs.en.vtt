00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.830
 let's put 770 to work yes r 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 770 series from nvidia to already a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 family and the second sister and the series 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.359
 because the first 760 to 780 thousand in the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.699
 sequence is likely to occur during the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.970
 time we have already entered from 750 and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.880
 the input models but the 770 does not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 to call the input card does not give 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
 To call her a girl, she's 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.140
 really getting there on the high end 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 in it is a high end because in 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 performance what we expect from it is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.899
 something very close to gtx 680 that was 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 previous family of the series prior to 770 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.370
 most likely here at bs-4 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.730
 delivering a performance equal to or greater 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.020
 even in other games you can see 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.789
 depending on the game performance 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.449
 higher in the 60's and 70's 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.309
 let's take a look at the map then the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.299
 people are having an average of 50 frames 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.540
 per second arriving in 61 of the moments 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 What's really cool is fine. 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.650
 expressive and I think the guy does not give 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.189
 to understand that they perform similarly 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 yes to 680 as always at the end of the day I 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.320
 I'll put the flex to rotate during 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.229
 Sixty seconds, where are we going? 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 attested or to the performance of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 he will deliver the numbers with the minimum 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 medium that the board it can 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.090
 give it to us 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.140
 it's really technical specs 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.409
 to 776 in temptation very close to 770 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.500
 in 1536 when he wakes up my gift for 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.439
 1536 parallel processors nÃ© 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.740
 the clock you can reach 85 thousand 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.240
 megasex inside the gto look for the way it is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.250
 look for nvidia technology in this 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 new family break that varies the clock 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 dynamically according to the situation 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.390
 so when you're inside a game like 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.390
 now for example it rises up and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.550
 operates faster now certainly not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.040
 it is 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.600
 35 megahertz there on the plate delivering me 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.620
 this result is that you are seeing 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.210
 a taboo and interesting, very cool 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.960
 if you are thinking of buying a 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:26.030
 top plate is is the 770 is a choice and if 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.620
 you are in doubt between her and the 680 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.750
 I think the criterion to be taken into account 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.970
 most likely consideration is price 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.490
 as yet a new family might be 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.780
 accept is with a good price but 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.160
 also as it gets more 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.630
 scarce in the market is the price can rise 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.730
 market and behave manner and is 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.800
 very strange times they distributors them 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.440
 caliber this price sometimes according to 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.720
 with the volume of purchase with negotiations 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.220
 so I think the price in this case between 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.850
 the two plates can be determinant 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.940
 for you in relation to efficiency 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.240
 these things are geared to the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.580
 energy consumption, the two are very 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.030
 similar to 770 being a little bit more 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.830
 efficient but I think nothing that can 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.480
 determine your beauty choice then 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.209
 That's right it was horrible board 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.739
 remembering that soon the rocket goes 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.030
 Selling video cards too. 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.810
 so for you you're doing your 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.070
 bellocchi 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.060
 soon you will be able to buy the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:27.560
 ippon card on the route of beauty and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.780
 If you already have your machine, you 're asking. 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.000
 I can not stand a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.750
 new video and I'm there you want to buy 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.150
 a new machine force place ' is ours 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.190
 recommendation the best machines 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.440
 planet is in force and if you 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.280
 want to compare is to set up your machine 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.140
 with many 770 just go into the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 ford configurator or choose 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.030
 any machine there and change your board 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.010
 video for 770 beauty sure one 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.310
 exceptional choice for you wanting 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.770
 to roll four fines 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.480
 If you have any questions, instead of 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.620
 leave youtube comments can 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.120
 leave but not always people 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.790
 can respond 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.590
 gives a little jump in the rock forum without talking 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.710
 rockets dot com 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.140
 Go to the forum 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.790
 doubt there that it is much easier of 20 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.940
 years will be with the live that is good is 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.060
 That was our review of ours. 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.820
 overview our overview there are still 770 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.940
 I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.150
 young person in the video if you liked it 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.010
 liked also can give the dislike more 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.060
 subscribe to the channel in the next videos 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.160
 there 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.590
 I bet it will surprise you to understand. 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.070
 but rather news to present a 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.070
 Hugs, thanks for being here. 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.070
