00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
spaces and very good in our spaces and I
think<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> should<00:01:47.579> remain<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> it's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
think it should remain like that it's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.280 
think it should remain like that it's
just<00:01:48.899> easier<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:50.189> people<00:01:50.700> related<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> us
