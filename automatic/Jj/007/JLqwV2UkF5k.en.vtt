00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:04.462
Now, a comedienne here from Cologne.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:06.014
Please welcome Enissa Amani.

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:25.686
Hello.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:27.780
Thank you.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.870
Hello.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.520
Yes.  Thank you, thank you.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.583
Yes. It's a great honour, I'm delighted
to be here as a guest on TV Total again.

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:38.130
I can only say it's all going for me.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.498
Yeah, but I don't really care
if people find me funny.

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.349
The main thing is
that they like my little dress.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.325
Yes ... no ... because I never
wanted to be a comedienne.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.956
I originally studied law.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:53.533
My idea was to become a lawyer
for women's rights in Iran.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.820
The best job in the world –
you have the whole day free.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.359
The only ones who have even less to do

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.562
are those appointed to look after children
by the Catholic Church.

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.181
We laugh ...

00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:07.182
Yes ... no ... so now I'm a comedienne

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.947
and must now get used to the fact
that everyone has an opinion ...

00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:13.872
and then on Facebook they write
sometimes something like,

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:16.195
"Bah, she's totally unfunny,

00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:19.209
completely untalented,
altogether overvalued,

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.205
she only looks good."

00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:23.973
And I write below, "Bah, thank you."

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.509
Someone else writes something like,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.791
"I find her really horrid.

00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:30.446
But she's really clever
and the gags really kick home."

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:32.488
And I'm, "What?" – delete comment.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.380
Block user.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:36.864
I report them for racism.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.557
Yes ... no, but I realize
I've not been at it very long,

00:01:40.613 --> 00:01:44.363
and on Facebook and YouTube and so on,
you, you can't get it right with people.

00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:46.039
No matter what you write,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.923
someone's got a gripe whatever you do.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:50.102
I've already tested it.

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:54.159
You can write on Facebook,
"Peace for mankind".

00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:57.580
and someone writes underneath,
"And what about the animals, Enissa?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.292
What about the animals?
You've something against animals?

00:02:00.338 --> 00:02:02.563
Enissa Armani is against animals.

00:02:02.584 --> 00:02:04.874
Enissa Armani slaughters seals."

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.813
Yes, and then there's the totally crazy
who simply insult you.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.068
They've not seen you on TV
for five minutes twice

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:14.605
and they insult you, yes?

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.387
They write all the bad words,
like, "whore", "bitch", yes.

00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:20.398
What are you laughing about?

00:02:20.444 --> 00:02:24.170
And I've taken them to heart,
also those totally evil things.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.859
How can you be like it?

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.699
I went into all the whole bad things.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.330
I posted everywhere underneath,

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:32.043
"Your mother", "Your mother",
"Your mother".

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.750
Yes, really. It was quite vulgar
of these sons of bitches.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.144
Yes, I really like saying
"son of a bitch",

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.366
my favourite words,

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:53.250
but I thought I might explain it a little
for those who find it shocking.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.437
"Son of a bitch", my dears,
is not a term you should over analyse.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.209
It's just a derogatory term
my generation uses.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.323
It also has nothing
to do with the mothers,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.214
nothing at all to do with the mothers.

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:05.577
Yes, the best Mama,
the very sweetest Mama,

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.587
who's really done everything right,
put in every effort,

00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:11.401
sometimes has a son of a bitch
as a son, yes?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.642
"Son of a bitch" is just that, right?

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:15.646
And it's not just directed against people,

00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:17.791
an iPhone battery
is a son of a bitch. Yes?

00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:21.222
That is why I've simply
just always used the word.

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:23.596
Used it towards everyone
without a care.

00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:24.998
It's just a term in fashion.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.376
My generation would also
formulate laws differently. Yes?

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.981
Straight off, your constitution,
first paragraph,

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:35.379
"The honour of a son of a bitch
is inviolable."

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.623
Then I thought,

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:38.227
"No, I must get a thicker skin

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.580
and I must learn to get along
with these bad comments."

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.364
And I thought, "How might I see
to do that from rappers?"

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:47.296
Rappers are always being insulted,
and insulted in return,

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:48.796
can get along with it.

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.914
And I've heard a load of Gangster Rap.

00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:54.645
But what bothers me about them
is that they must always play the big man,

00:03:54.657 --> 00:03:57.596
always money, money, money:
"I have so much money."

00:03:57.596 --> 00:04:00.716
"I don't know what you do
with so much money."

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.217
"I fly from the living room
to the bathroom with my private jet."

00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:09.024
"Yes, always a G-Class Merc.The stars.
Purple notes, purple notes, purple notes."

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.100
Does anyone know
what a purple note is? Purple note?

00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:14.165
Yes!? You've got it going for you.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:15.455
A 500.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:19.879
500 euro note. I didn't know ... I swear
I didn't know there were 500 euro notes.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:26.014
I thought a purple note was
a chocolate wrapper like a 10 euro note.

00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:37.503
And it's nothing authentic,
totally unauthentic.

00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:39.142
It's not right earning so much.

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:40.413
The good about ...

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:43.478
There's one, excuse me,
there's one among them

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:47.298
who really earns a lot of money,
who's rightly the circus master,

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.772
so rightly, and that is Helene Fischer.

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.768
Helene Fischer, yes, there she sits –

00:04:58.384 --> 00:04:59.896
Yes, I fête her totally.

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:02.516
I don't know what's with people –
I think she's super.

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:05.736
She's really got plenty
of purple notes.

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:08.926
I mean she is simply ring mistress,
one just has to accept it.

00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:11.389
She's a picture-perfect woman, yes,

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.934
she must make music
like G-Class Mercedes, yes?

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:18.073
She must go to these rappers
and sing something like,

00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:20.553
"Bow down bitches, bow, bow down."

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:21.901
Because she's the boss.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.695
It's really going for Helene Fischer,
I fête her totally.

00:05:24.698 --> 00:05:25.940
For me, for my generation,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.309
Helene Fischer is something like
Germany's Beyonce.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.178
Yes? Yes. I think she's super.
I fête that totally.

00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:35.090
But what makes me really sad is,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.460
if Helene Fischer is Germany's Beyonce,
then Florian Silbereisen is Jay Z.

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:44.359
Really bad ... really bad ...

00:05:47.272 --> 00:05:48.272
totally bad.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.550
Yes ...

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:55.926
And I've watched the German
comedy and cabaret scene,

00:05:55.936 --> 00:05:59.242
and I've seen that it's always usual
that one sings a song. Yes?

00:05:59.253 --> 00:06:02.163
And I've seen that they always
bring a guitar and piano out.

00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:05.386
I've also prepared a song
and thought we'd sing a little together.

00:06:05.404 --> 00:06:07.173
But we must all join in, okay?

00:06:07.173 --> 00:06:08.173
So:

00:06:08.183 --> 00:06:11.725
Hitler was a son of a bitch,
doo dah, doo dah,

00:06:11.734 --> 00:06:15.422
Hitler was a son of a bitch,
doo dah, doo dah, doo

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.123
Hitler was a son of a bitch,
doo dah, doo dah,

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:21.863
Hitler was a son of a bitch ...

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:23.327
Thank you.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.908
I've also ridden a lot.

00:06:56.297 --> 00:06:59.411
Did I hear that right just now?

00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:01.713
Did I hear that right?

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.375
I thought we were only making
documentaries here.
