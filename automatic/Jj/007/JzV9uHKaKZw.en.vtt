00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
couple of changes to then I guess the

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.020 
couple of changes to then I guess the
name<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.740> everyone's<00:00:02.100> lips<00:00:02.310> will<00:00:02.520> be<00:00:02.550> George

Thorne<00:00:03.300> back<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.780> starting<00:00:04.020> lineup<00:00:04.529> yeah

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
Thorne back in the starting lineup yeah

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.110 
Thorne back in the starting lineup yeah
that's<00:00:05.040> right<00:00:05.279> it's<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> great<00:00:05.759> boost<00:00:06.000> for

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
that's right it's a great boost for

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.820 
that's right it's a great boost for
everybody<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.870> George<00:00:07.170> back<00:00:07.440> her

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
everybody to have George back her

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.640 
everybody to have George back her
probably<00:00:08.550> bigger<00:00:09.269> boost<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.750> himself<00:00:10.230> as

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
probably bigger boost for himself as

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.370 
probably bigger boost for himself as
well<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.190> he's<00:00:11.670> worked<00:00:11.940> extremely<00:00:12.389> hard<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
well and he's worked extremely hard to

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.230 
well and he's worked extremely hard to
get<00:00:13.559> himself<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.160> point<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.210> think

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
get himself to this point and I think

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.970 
get himself to this point and I think
probably<00:00:16.049> from<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> ended<00:00:16.859> december
