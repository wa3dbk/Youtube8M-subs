this is an empty lot right here which is
where<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.890> usually<00:00:20.400> fly<00:00:20.550> some<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> these

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
where I usually fly some of these

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
brushless kit that I had on before it's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.020 
brushless kit that I had on before it's
a<00:01:15.090> walk<00:01:15.270> hero<00:01:15.570> setup<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> CB<00:01:17.460> 180<00:01:17.909> D<00:01:20.030> and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.950 

there's<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.960> cover<00:01:36.210> should<00:01:37.210> be<00:01:37.270> all<00:01:37.510> set<00:01:37.810> up

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
there's the cover should be all set up

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.950 
there's the cover should be all set up
make<00:01:38.290> sure<00:01:38.470> our<00:01:39.000> servers<00:01:40.000> are<00:01:40.330> all<00:01:40.479> working

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960

as<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:09.920> see<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:11.350> tailhold<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.440> pretty

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
as you can see the tailhold is pretty

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.820 
as you can see the tailhold is pretty
good<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:17.050> am<00:02:18.050> fighting<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.500> wind<00:02:18.710> a

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
good on it I am fighting the wind a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.670 
good on it I am fighting the wind a
little<00:02:18.860> bit<00:02:19.100> here<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.840> breeze<00:02:21.110> picks<00:02:21.470> up

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
little bit here the breeze picks up

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:40.720 
little bit here the breeze picks up
every<00:02:21.980> now<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.430> then

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.720 

fighting<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> little<00:02:41.720> bit<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.020> breeze<00:02:42.260> here

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.460 

you<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.880> see<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.239> helicopter<00:02:50.450> Bob<00:02:51.170> went

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
you can see the helicopter Bob went

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.570 
you can see the helicopter Bob went
around<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:52.040> because<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.610> wind<00:02:54.580> this

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
around it's because of the wind this

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.550 
around it's because of the wind this
camera<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.209> use<00:02:56.390> isn't<00:02:56.720> exactly<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.319> greatest

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
camera we use isn't exactly the greatest

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.760 
camera we use isn't exactly the greatest
camera<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.580> see<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> navigation<00:02:59.720> lights<00:03:00.470> on

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.050 
camera but see the navigation lights on
it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.230 

just<00:03:07.690> like<00:03:07.960> really<00:03:08.410> good<00:03:08.620> dome<00:03:08.890> there's<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.030> ton

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
just like really good dome there's a ton

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.350 
just like really good dome there's a ton
of<00:03:10.270> power

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
see how good my camera's here you don't

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.620 
see how good my camera's here you don't
have<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.640> hold<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:34.000> way<00:03:34.180> up<00:03:34.330> in<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> air<00:03:34.570> dear
