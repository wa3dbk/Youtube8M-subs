okay<00:00:01.110> welcome<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> question<00:00:02.220> one<00:00:02.460> it<00:00:02.939> says<00:00:03.270> the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
okay welcome to question one it says the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay welcome to question one it says the
numbers<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.230> two<00:00:04.410> triangles<00:00:04.740> i've<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.490> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
numbers and the two triangles i've up to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.670 
numbers and the two triangles i've up to
the<00:00:05.730> number<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.120> square<00:00:06.420> an<00:00:06.960> example<00:00:07.560> we've

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
the number of a square an example we've

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.100 
the number of a square an example we've
got<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.340> 10<00:00:08.700> plus<00:00:09.570> 15<00:00:09.840> equals<00:00:10.880> 25<00:00:11.910> okay<00:00:12.719> so

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
got is that 10 plus 15 equals 25 okay so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
got is that 10 plus 15 equals 25 okay so
what<00:00:13.259> we've<00:00:13.469> got<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.940> we've<00:00:15.089> got<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
what we've got to do is we've got to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.689 
what we've got to do is we've got to
using<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> same<00:00:16.199> rule<00:00:16.529> we've<00:00:17.250> got<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> write

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
using the same rule we've got to write

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.570 
using the same rule we've got to write
in<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.940> missing<00:00:18.330> numbers<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.050> square

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
in the missing numbers in this square

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.779 
in the missing numbers in this square
okay

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
okay

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
okay
so<00:00:21.769> 55<00:00:22.769> plus<00:00:23.519> 75<00:00:24.269> will<00:00:24.900> equal<00:00:25.289> whatever<00:00:25.560> answer

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
so 55 plus 75 will equal whatever answer

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040 
so 55 plus 75 will equal whatever answer
is<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> square<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.750> gonna<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
is in the square so it's gonna be a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
is in the square so it's gonna be a
little<00:00:28.199> column<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> 55<00:00:29.640> plus<00:00:30.949> 75<00:00:32.420> here<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.510> go

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
little column and 55 plus 75 here we go

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.389 
little column and 55 plus 75 here we go
5<00:00:34.440> +<00:00:34.710> 5<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.190> 10<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.880> your<00:00:36.000> zero<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.480> carrier<00:00:36.960> 1<00:00:37.399> 5

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
5 + 5 is 10 put your zero in carrier 1 5

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.290 
5 + 5 is 10 put your zero in carrier 1 5
-<00:00:38.640> 7<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.180> 12<00:00:39.629> pull<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.649> some<00:00:40.950> only<00:00:41.280> carries<00:00:41.670> 13

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
- 7 is 12 pull off some only carries 13

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170 
- 7 is 12 pull off some only carries 13
put<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> three<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.489> could<00:00:44.820> carry<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
put you three in now we could carry the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
put you three in now we could carry the
1<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.750> considering<00:00:46.289> there's<00:00:46.469> no<00:00:46.770> extra

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
1 but considering there's no extra

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
1 but considering there's no extra
column<00:00:47.670> throughout<00:00:47.969> anyway<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.690> might<00:00:48.870> want

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
column throughout anyway we might want

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
column throughout anyway we might want
to<00:00:49.140> pull<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.620> straight<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to pull out one straight in for the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.189 
to pull out one straight in for the
answer<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.739> 130<00:00:54.680> now<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.039> bottom<00:00:56.520> one

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
answer in 130 now if this bottom one

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.029 
answer in 130 now if this bottom one
remember<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:59.030> triangle<00:01:00.170> plus<00:01:01.170> triangle

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
remember it's triangle plus triangle

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
remember it's triangle plus triangle
equals<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> squares<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.359> 25<00:01:03.989> plus<00:01:04.320> whatever's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
equals the squares so 25 plus whatever's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.850 
equals the squares so 25 plus whatever's
in<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.189> must<00:01:05.610> equal<00:01:05.970> x<00:01:06.060> +<00:01:06.299> 20<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> already

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
in here must equal x + 20 but we already

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
in here must equal x + 20 but we already
know<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> square<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.390> we've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.960> can

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
know the square so we've got it we can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.590 
know the square so we've got it we can
reverse<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.180> start<00:01:12.510> with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
reverse this time so if we start with

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.740 
reverse this time so if we start with
120<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.939> subtract<00:01:15.080> 25<00:01:17.299> whatever<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.420> left

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
120 and subtract 25 whatever is left

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800 
120 and subtract 25 whatever is left
will<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.600> okay

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
will go in here okay

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
will go in here okay
now<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> may<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.740> able<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.189> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
now some of you may be able to do that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.179 
now some of you may be able to do that
in<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.810> taking<00:01:25.380> 25<00:01:25.979> off

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
in your head because taking 25 off

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
in your head because taking 25 off
should<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.670> quite<00:01:26.909> easy<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.630> off<00:01:27.780> 20

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
should be quite easy you can take off 20

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.240 
should be quite easy you can take off 20
first<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.640> take<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> 5<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.439> 120

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
first and then take off the 5 so 120

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.590 
first and then take off the 5 so 120
takeaway<00:01:32.670> 20<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.290> 100<00:01:35.150> then<00:01:36.150> take<00:01:36.420> away

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
takeaway 20 would be 100 then take away

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.550 
takeaway 20 would be 100 then take away
the<00:01:36.720> extra<00:01:37.200> 5<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:38.009> 100<00:01:38.549> would<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.790> 95<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the extra 5 from 100 would be 95 so it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.330 
the extra 5 from 100 would be 95 so it
looks<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.369> though<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.060> gonna<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.479> 95<00:01:43.220> if<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
looks as though it's gonna be 95 if you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.620 
looks as though it's gonna be 95 if you
just<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:44.939> column<00:01:45.329> F<00:01:45.450> to

just want to do a little column F to

just want to do a little column F to
