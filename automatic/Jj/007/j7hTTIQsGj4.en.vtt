feel like it's a little easier to hear
without<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.369> super<00:01:23.640> slow<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.360> groove

of<00:02:08.850> between<00:02:09.119> these<00:02:09.420> sick<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.899> patience<00:02:10.229> with

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
of between these sick of patience with

the<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> kick<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.730> left<00:02:11.910> hand<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the with a kick and the left hand on the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.870 
the with a kick and the left hand on the
snare<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.650> when<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> first<00:02:14.280> try<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.519> break<00:02:14.760> this

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
snare so when I first try to break this

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.479 
snare so when I first try to break this
down<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:15.120> myself<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.890> tried<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.370> that

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
down for myself I just tried to do that

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.580 
down for myself I just tried to do that
first<00:02:17.819> part<00:02:18.150> over<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.989> over<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.260> over<00:02:19.350> again

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
first part over and over and over again

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.420 
first part over and over and over again
which<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:19.980> between<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.370> kick<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.670> snare<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
which is between the kick and snare and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.590 
which is between the kick and snare and
this<00:02:23.430> was<00:02:23.549> probably<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> best<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.330> start

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
this was probably the best way to start

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.030 
this was probably the best way to start
practicing<00:02:25.049> this<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.769> feel

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
practicing this is just to get the feel

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.100 
practicing this is just to get the feel
of<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.340> left<00:02:26.549> hand<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.510> syncopated

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
of that left hand and the syncopated

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:55.520 
of that left hand and the syncopated
phrase<00:02:29.069> here<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:54.530> just

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
phrase here so it's like this just

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.920 
phrase here so it's like this just
trying<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.799> nail<00:02:55.920> these<00:02:56.130> accents<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.359> get

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
trying to nail these accents and I get

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.160 
trying to nail these accents and I get
that<00:02:58.109> as<00:02:58.260> smooth<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.650> possible<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.840> he<00:03:00.840> really

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
that as smooth as possible and he really

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.280 
that as smooth as possible and he really
accents<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.579> uh<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.870> through<00:03:04.079> County

right<00:03:07.200> after<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> first<00:03:07.680> backbeat<00:03:08.130> on<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.609> he

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
right after the first backbeat on to he

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.520 
right after the first backbeat on to he
accents<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.950> uh<00:03:10.980> three<00:03:11.910> uh<00:03:11.940> four<00:03:12.930> with<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
accents to uh three uh four with the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:40.660 
accents to uh three uh four with the
kick<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.739> snare<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.639> it's<00:03:14.940> sort<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.329> like<00:03:15.480> this

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.949 

so<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.849> put<00:03:42.030> those<00:03:42.150> together<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.840> get

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
so if you put those together and you get

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.740 
so if you put those together and you get
that<00:03:43.170> worked<00:03:43.530> out<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.849> first<00:03:45.120> bar<00:03:45.420> this

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
that worked out so the first bar this

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.020 
that worked out so the first bar this
groove<00:03:46.049> can<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.069> its<00:03:47.310> own<00:03:47.400> groove<00:03:47.730> actual

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
groove can can be its own groove actual

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.550 
groove can can be its own groove actual
if<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.269> repeated<00:03:48.659> it<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.840> something

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
if you just repeated it and something

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:03.860 
if you just repeated it and something
like<00:03:49.769> this<00:04:01.970> okay<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.299> second<00:04:03.659> part<00:04:03.780> of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
like this okay so the second part of

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.679 
like this okay so the second part of
this<00:04:03.989> groove<00:04:04.319> is<00:04:05.010> kind<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.609> weird<00:04:05.819> because<00:04:06.090> as

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
this groove is kind of weird because as

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.289 
this groove is kind of weird because as
he<00:04:07.680> continues<00:04:08.159> this<00:04:08.370> phrase<00:04:08.790> with<00:04:08.969> his<00:04:09.060> left

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
he continues this phrase with his left

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.869 
he continues this phrase with his left
hand<00:04:09.569> on<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.079> snare<00:04:10.139> hints<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.129> accenting<00:04:11.730> the

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
hand on the snare hints of accenting the

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.879 
hand on the snare hints of accenting the
of<00:04:12.180> B<00:04:12.780> for<00:04:13.319> measure<00:04:14.159> one<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:15.229> then<00:04:16.229> place<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
of B for measure one and then place a

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.759 
of B for measure one and then place a
backbeat<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.699> buzzed<00:04:18.060> back<00:04:18.419> beat<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.870> beat<00:04:19.380> two

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
backbeat a buzzed back beat on beat two

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.930 
backbeat a buzzed back beat on beat two
of<00:04:21.229> not<00:04:22.229> measure<00:04:22.440> two<00:04:22.650> then<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:23.699> he<00:04:23.759> does<00:04:23.880> is

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
of not measure two then what he does is

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.760 
of not measure two then what he does is
he<00:04:24.349> offsets<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:26.610> backbeat<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.509> four<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.260> in

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
he offsets the backbeat to four and in

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.360 
he offsets the backbeat to four and in
measure<00:04:29.430> two<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.710> also<00:04:31.710> offsets<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
measure two and also offsets the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.680 
measure two and also offsets the
downbeat<00:04:32.909> when<00:04:33.419> he<00:04:33.510> recycles<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.199> pattern<00:04:35.690> to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
downbeat when he recycles the pattern to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.969 
downbeat when he recycles the pattern to
the<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.800> one<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.479> start<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.199> groove<00:04:40.740> on

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
the of of one so we start the groove on

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.760 
the of of one so we start the groove on
one<00:04:41.580> but<00:04:42.060> then<00:04:42.210> when<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.449> recycles<00:04:42.810> its

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
one but then when it recycles its

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.740 
one but then when it recycles its
offsets<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:44.669> hand<00:04:44.909> that<00:04:45.180> sounds<00:04:45.539> kind<00:04:45.720> of

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
offsets to one hand that sounds kind of

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.439 
offsets to one hand that sounds kind of
confusing<00:04:46.320> but<00:04:47.000> let<00:04:48.000> me<00:04:48.090> just<00:04:48.120> play<00:04:48.389> the

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
confusing but let me just play the

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.719 
confusing but let me just play the
groove<00:04:48.750> again<00:04:48.900> from<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.010> beginning<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
groove again from the beginning and

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.399 
groove again from the beginning and
you'll<00:04:50.880> see<00:04:50.970> what<00:04:51.060> I<00:04:51.090> mean<00:04:51.300> in<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:52.050> second

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
you'll see what I mean in the second

00:04:52.409 --> 00:05:18.290 
you'll see what I mean in the second
half<00:04:52.590> here<00:04:52.860> so<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.650> this<00:05:16.800> creates<00:05:17.250> like<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.880> real

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
half here so so this creates like a real

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.749 
half here so so this creates like a real
syncopated<00:05:18.900> feel<00:05:19.110> because<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:20.490> kind<00:05:20.699> of

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
syncopated feel because you kind of

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.249 
syncopated feel because you kind of
don't<00:05:20.970> know<00:05:21.030> where<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.389> backbeat<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:21.840> where

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
don't know where the backbeat is where

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.050 
don't know where the backbeat is where
the<00:05:22.380> downbeat<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:22.949> but<00:05:23.490> once<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.759> slow<00:05:23.940> it

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
the downbeat is but once you slow it

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.210 
the downbeat is but once you slow it
down<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.690> really<00:05:25.020> get<00:05:25.259> it<00:05:25.349> down<00:05:25.380> it's<00:05:26.130> a

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
down and and really get it down it's a

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.899 
down and and really get it down it's a
super<00:05:26.610> cool<00:05:26.789> groove<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:28.729> you<00:05:29.729> know<00:05:29.820> I'm

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
super cool groove and you know I'm

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.460 
super cool groove and you know I'm
pretty<00:05:30.030> sure<00:05:30.210> he<00:05:30.270> just<00:05:30.330> improvised<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:31.080> on<00:05:31.259> the

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
pretty sure he just improvised it on the

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.709 
pretty sure he just improvised it on the
spot<00:05:31.740> which<00:05:32.070> is<00:05:32.099> kind<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.490> annoying<00:05:32.729> but

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
spot which is kind of annoying but

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:34.580 
spot which is kind of annoying but
awesome<00:05:33.900> too

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
awesome too
