00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so we are in the fourth position and we

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.130 
so we are in the fourth position and we
have<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> rare<00:01:04.949> hybrid<00:01:05.220> dragons<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.930> are

powerful dragons and they are obtained
and<00:01:10.850> they<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.030> special<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and they are special because if you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
and they are special because if you
booted<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.159> together<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.600> better

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
booted them together you can get better

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.690 
booted them together you can get better
and<00:01:16.890> better<00:01:17.070> dragons<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:20.009> deserve<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and better dragons so they deserve to be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.950 
and better dragons so they deserve to be
in<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.180> position<00:01:21.799> let's<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> next<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
in this position let's see the next one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.100 
in this position let's see the next one
so<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> third<00:01:26.700> position<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.689> we

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so we are in the third position and we

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.090 
so we are in the third position and we
have<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.619> four<00:01:29.130> elements<00:01:29.400> dragons<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> these

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
have all four elements dragons so these

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
have all four elements dragons so these
drugs<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:33.560> unique<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> their<00:01:36.000> four

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
drugs are unique because of their four

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.020 
drugs are unique because of their four
elements<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> power

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
elements and power

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.690 
elements and power
they<00:01:39.420> are<00:01:39.570> hard<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> obtain<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
they are hard to obtain so let's go to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.260 
they are hard to obtain so let's go to
the<00:01:42.120> main<00:01:43.010> reason<00:01:44.010> they<00:01:44.190> are<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.550> because<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the main reason they are here because of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.410 
the main reason they are here because of
the<00:01:45.450> millennium<00:01:45.900> dragon<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:47.000> can<00:01:48.000> only<00:01:48.240> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the millennium dragon which can only be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.130 
the millennium dragon which can only be
vertical<00:01:49.200> hit<00:01:49.380> by<00:01:49.620> only<00:01:49.979> ten<00:01:50.330> dragons<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
vertical hit by only ten dragons this is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.070 
vertical hit by only ten dragons this is
pretty<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.920> powerful<00:01:53.430> let<00:01:54.420> me<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.780> what

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
pretty much so powerful let me know what

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.710 
pretty much so powerful let me know what
you<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> let's<00:01:57.390> check<00:01:57.600> out

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
you think about this so let's check out

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.330 
you think about this so let's check out
that<00:01:57.750> next<00:01:58.470> one<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.830> second

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that next one so we are in the second

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.250 
that next one so we are in the second
position<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.940> we<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.570> legendary

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
position and we have all legendary

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.820 
position and we have all legendary
dragons<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:06.150> origin<00:02:06.540> origin<00:02:06.840> diagram<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.650> not

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
dragons the origin origin diagram is not

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.460 
dragons the origin origin diagram is not
the<00:02:08.220> primary<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.880> Robin<00:02:09.660> Hood<00:02:09.690> again<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the primary like Robin Hood again so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.460 
the primary like Robin Hood again so
stuff<00:02:10.740> anyway<00:02:11.670> these<00:02:12.180> dragons<00:02:12.630> are<00:02:12.870> hard<00:02:13.350> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
stuff anyway these dragons are hard to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.880 
stuff anyway these dragons are hard to
obtain<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.000> powerful<00:02:15.000> let's<00:02:15.450> make<00:02:15.870> them<00:02:16.110> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
obtain and powerful let's make them to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.650 
obtain and powerful let's make them to
be<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> second<00:02:17.640> position<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.209> might<00:02:18.390> want

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
be in the second position you might want

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.470 
be in the second position you might want
to<00:02:18.750> say<00:02:18.989> why<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:19.739> not<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.480> you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to say why they are not in the first you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.440 
to say why they are not in the first you
will<00:02:21.630> see<00:02:21.780> why<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.890> these<00:02:23.130> dragons<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.970> only

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
will see why so these dragons have only

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.780 
will see why so these dragons have only
one<00:02:24.720> weak<00:02:24.900> point<00:02:24.930> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.190> legendary

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
one weak point which is a legendary

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.050 
one weak point which is a legendary
against<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.600> legend<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.989> legend<00:02:28.860> taken<00:02:29.280> vertical

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
against a legend a legend taken vertical

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.920 
against a legend a legend taken vertical

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
first position

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.530 
first position
and<00:02:54.630> now<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.710> in<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.250> first<00:02:56.730> position<00:02:57.330> and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
and now we are in the first position and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.620 
and now we are in the first position and
we<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.020> your<00:02:58.320> dragons<00:02:58.920> these<00:02:59.700> dragons<00:03:00.300> have

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
we have your dragons these dragons have

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.630 
we have your dragons these dragons have
their<00:03:00.900> name<00:03:01.110> they<00:03:01.380> are<00:03:01.530> pure<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.400> cool

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
their name they are pure really cool

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.490 
their name they are pure really cool
because<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.510> don't<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.810> weakness<00:03:04.260> point

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
because they don't have weakness point

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.240 
because they don't have weakness point
so<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.520> means<00:03:05.820> no<00:03:06.690> dragon<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.290> Circle<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:07.920> on

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
so that means no dragon can Circle it on

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.350 
so that means no dragon can Circle it on
them<00:03:08.520> but<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.960> got<00:03:10.730> pure<00:03:11.730> dragon<00:03:12.180> with

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
them but if you got pure dragon with
