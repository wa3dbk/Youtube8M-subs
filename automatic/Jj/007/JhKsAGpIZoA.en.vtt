and<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> handlebars<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and go over the handlebars like you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
and go over the handlebars like you
would<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.010> her<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.309> narrower<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.180> pointy<00:01:03.960> nose

would with her a narrower or pointy nose
model<00:01:05.450> as<00:01:06.450> well<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.430> quite<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> thick

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
model as well it's it's quite a thick

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
model as well it's it's quite a thick
board<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.520> very<00:01:11.520> stable<00:01:12.290> quite<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> flat<00:01:13.650> deck

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
board so very stable quite a flat deck

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.320 
board so very stable quite a flat deck
so<00:01:14.930> under<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> chest<00:01:16.439> board<00:01:17.340> us<00:01:17.610> rock<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.119> tip

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so under the chest board us rock and tip

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.899 
so under the chest board us rock and tip
too<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> once<00:01:20.430> again<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:20.850> you're

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
too much so once again when you're

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.249 
too much so once again when you're
pushing<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> stand<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.689> you've<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pushing the stand up you've got a lot of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.520 
pushing the stand up you've got a lot of
control<00:01:22.909> one<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.170> one<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> really

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
control one of the one of the really

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
control one of the one of the really
good<00:01:25.710> features<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.400> design<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.240> well

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
good features with this design as well

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.080 
good features with this design as well
is<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:29.490> comes<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
is that it comes with that

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.130 
is that it comes with that
a<00:01:31.240> nice<00:01:31.689> turn<00:01:32.649> up<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.100> nose<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.329> as<00:01:34.659> you're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
a nice turn up in the nose so as you're

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.279 
a nice turn up in the nose so as you're
surfing<00:01:36.479> progresses<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.659> gets<00:01:37.840> better<00:01:38.049> and

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
surfing progresses and gets better and

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.529 
surfing progresses and gets better and
you<00:01:38.590> need<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.159> serve<00:01:39.369> closer<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.179> pocket

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
you need to serve closer to the pocket

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.289 
you need to serve closer to the pocket
that<00:01:41.049> extra<00:01:41.500> rocker<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.250> board<00:01:42.549> will<00:01:42.850> allow

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
that extra rocker and board will allow

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.469 
that extra rocker and board will allow
you<00:01:43.359> to<00:01:43.479> sit<00:01:43.750> closer<00:01:44.079> to<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.189> curl<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.329> way

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
you to sit closer to the curl of the way

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.260 
you to sit closer to the curl of the way
and<00:01:47.439> give<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:47.920> still<00:01:48.219> give<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.759> control

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
and give you still give you that control

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.410 
and give you still give you that control
that<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.659> need<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.170> also<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:52.060> that

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
that you need and also that that

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.809 
that you need and also that that
particular<00:01:52.569> design<00:01:53.289> feature<00:01:53.729> combining<00:01:54.729> with

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
particular design feature combining with

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.840 
particular design feature combining with
the<00:01:54.880> slightly<00:01:55.450> narrower<00:01:55.840> nose<00:01:56.579> allows<00:01:57.579> you<00:01:57.729> to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
the slightly narrower nose allows you to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.870 
the slightly narrower nose allows you to
turn<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.240> board<00:01:58.390> sharper<00:01:59.429> then<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.579> would<00:02:00.759> on

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
turn the board sharper then you would on

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880 
turn the board sharper then you would on
a<00:02:00.909> standard<00:02:01.479> what<00:02:01.780> really<00:02:02.109> wide<00:02:02.319> min<00:02:02.619> email

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
a standard what really wide min email

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.569 
a standard what really wide min email
nose<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.299> then<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.200> allows<00:02:05.799> you<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.280> lean

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
nose and then so it allows you to lean

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.669 
nose and then so it allows you to lean
more<00:02:06.610> towards<00:02:07.420> short<00:02:07.869> board<00:02:08.110> style<00:02:08.470> or

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
more towards short board style or

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.120 
more towards short board style or
surfing<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.849> really<00:02:10.420> good<00:02:10.780> learner<00:02:11.739> board

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
surfing so a really good learner board

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.490 
surfing so a really good learner board
but<00:02:12.819> also<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.180> very<00:02:13.480> good<00:02:13.540> intermediate<00:02:13.989> board

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
but also a very good intermediate board

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.009 
but also a very good intermediate board
that<00:02:14.799> allows<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.310> practice<00:02:15.579> terms<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
that allows you to practice terms the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.490 
that allows you to practice terms the
link<00:02:17.319> turns<00:02:17.650> together<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.810> able<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
link turns together so that you able to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
link turns together so that you able to
do<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> series<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.610> turns<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.569> similar

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
do a series of turns in a similar

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.390 
do a series of turns in a similar
fashion<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.319> how<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> write<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> short<00:02:24.129> board

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
fashion to how you write a short board
