00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone funny videos would love to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.859
 do a quick review and instructional video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.929
 about the frog special charge which 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.759
 allows you to fill any fireworks 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 battery + 3 charges is that it 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.260
 fits absolutely any battery 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.170
 and with it you can damage 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.180
 absolutely any device a pair of smartphone 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.429
 my phone is a hidden media player and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.189
 completely different devices for which you 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 have an afone get acme well let's 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.170
 let's start looking like levushka 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:43.469
 she has an outlet 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.500
 the battery clip here is clamped 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:53.030
 here is the battery and here we are 2 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:58.469
 traveling cream so they actually 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.370
 these terminals in order for us to be driven into 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.210
 clamp battery terminals connected to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.250
 battery contacts and will 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 charges a let 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 try so here we clamp and run to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:26.030
 clinic scheme 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.369
 repair can be flipped change 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.310
 polarity 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.640
 here I came but the owner of whom 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 rules which are selected option 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.390
 there is no glue location 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.899
 try several options like me 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.750
 said 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:51.030
 try two contacts next to the contract 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.030
 lying or code apart can be 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.130
 after 1 try to flip change 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.320
 polarity well here as you can see I have already 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.750
 all these guys will come on fire 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.420
 red light if red lights up 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 light bulb means that the streets picked up 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.899
 terminal layout is correct now 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.450
 it remains only to insert a frog in 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.569
 220 outlet 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.569
 he and wait until the thread 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.430
 if you did everything right time 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.220
 charging will continue to burn red 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.879
 the light bulb will also flash blue 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.500
 light bulb 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.840
 it means what happens 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.060
 recharge the battery also when 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.450
 charging will get completed flashes to 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.690
 the most extreme green light it will be 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.299
 mean this is what your battery is 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.510
 blue is fully recharged 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.660
 the light goes out 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.329
 Well that's it learned 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.480
 charge the battery by charging 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:00.239
