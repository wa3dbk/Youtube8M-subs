00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.610
 cook with you a red fish 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.840
 salmon bought my fillet 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 So I made a bug, I'll cut 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.609
 half half so the second part i 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.400
 I will remove because I will be with her tomorrow 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:31.050
 I will bake in the oven too 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.809
 foil so on until I forget tell you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.719
 that I already turned on the oven because 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.570
 I have already cleaned potatoes 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.989
 and fish in a skillet without 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.950
 oils of course it will just 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.940
 super well I prefer often in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 the oven just with potatoes or like me he 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.399
 said 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 foil in the second case on a greased 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 once it is visible to our faces, we all 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.060
 it was ready so well, okay fish 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.670
 don't get married later we take potatoes and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.030
 we cut it 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.180
 potatoes on such parts of the cover they 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 there should be such plump ones here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.479
 very thin you just understand us 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 potatoes will burn and will be like chips to us 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.979
 this is not necessary so well, we all proceed like this 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 we further laid out potatoes 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 we lay it out neatly and that we 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.509
 do on the principle can not lay out 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.049
 all the same that will stir 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:50.460
 Now we have her little salt so 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:52.610
 miss a few pinches of salt will not accept 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.610
 him 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.950
 stirred now neatly sat 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:11.370
 we lay everything out 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:15.410
 and we take the hook really me small 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.050
 will not go cut into two parts and cut 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.489
 straws 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:31.590
 straw we should not have only 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:34.400
 otherwise we burn it yourself understand it all 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.400
 it's time to push 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.500
 fluff and sprinkle our potatoes 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:12.370
 Japan is now one more thing we have 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:19.400
 here I sprinkle also universal seasoning 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:22.040
 just need a little general can not 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.120
 sprinkle can sprinkle pepper in general 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.900
 it is already on you to your taste and now 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.780
 back to the fish 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.980
 here it is of course I will cut off not these places 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.390
 I donâ€™t like a lot of fat here 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.830
 at least slightly live this 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:49.310
 I shall cut dark because it is not for me 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.020
 like a fish i cleaned principle okay 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.640
 tajir let them stay with us 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.570
 melt just eats our 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.660
 potatoes 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:12.080
 and cut us such a fate 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:15.080
 and be sure her salting but all the fish I 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.000
 cut we must cut not only here 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.390
 the minimum is such a thickness 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.419
 even more so that it is not ours and 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:30.260
 roasted did not become dry now we are 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:33.050
 the whole point of salt so he lay on 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.190
 I got our potatoes here 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.950
 so we remove the beauty with you 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 oven and bake at 180 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.310
 degrees about quarrel minutes in 45 but 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.480
 everything in general, like potatoes , we will 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.410
 gently means everything is ready go like that but 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.410
 check everything 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:03.010
 so here is our fish prepared by the way 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.850
 I forgot to say that you can fish 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:10.700
 help flour here but I forgot well, nothing 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.480
 scary and it turned out quite well on this 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.480
 all all bye
