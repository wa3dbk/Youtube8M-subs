 Gabriel held Merkel "a bad harmony 33 years after Olympia 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.640

 lost the software 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.390
 but it is true that Thomas s 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 for fear of the future 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.820
 that is by profession and hard 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 and when that step has been made to be explained 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 the Competition Commission Weko allegations have been "fair" 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.550
 The whole thing will be according to Zeltner own story 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.550
 where the right way 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.790
 continue 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.920
 I have 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.940
 burdened them even more 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.970
 to make a bit German the typography in general it is completely 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.310
