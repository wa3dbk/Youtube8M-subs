and I'm literally going to kind of trace

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
and I'm literally going to kind of trace
about<00:01:07.680> maybe<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:09.180> half<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.630> inch<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.170> either

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

side I'm just gonna roll this along I'm

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.609 
side I'm just gonna roll this along I'm
just<00:01:13.710> creating<00:01:14.180> basically<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.299> pattern<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
just creating basically a pattern so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.490 
just creating basically a pattern so
that'll<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> easier<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.580> me<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.439> kind<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that'll make it easier for me to kind of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
that'll make it easier for me to kind of
guesstimate<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.580> size<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.900> will<00:01:21.960> need<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> cut

glue you bet thank you so here's my

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.039 
glue you bet thank you so here's my
pattern<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> had<00:02:04.110> created<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:06.049> you're

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
pattern that I had created and you're

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.260 
pattern that I had created and you're
just<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.099> basic<00:02:08.539> adhesive

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
just going to use a basic adhesive

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.780 
just going to use a basic adhesive
and<00:02:11.140> you're<00:02:11.230> gonna<00:02:11.320> just<00:02:11.560> trace<00:02:11.980> along<00:02:12.460> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and you're gonna just trace along the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.990 
and you're gonna just trace along the
outer<00:02:12.970> edge<00:02:13.240> here<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.430> don't<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.880> be

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
outer edge here and you don't have to be

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.810 
outer edge here and you don't have to be
nice<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.420> neat<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.930> sloppy<00:02:17.820> that's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
nice and neat you can be sloppy that's

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.930 
nice and neat you can be sloppy that's
always<00:02:18.970> good<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.510> know<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:20.080> totally<00:02:20.680> agree<00:02:20.980> okay

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
always good I know I totally agree okay

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.510 
always good I know I totally agree okay
so<00:02:22.000> we've<00:02:22.330> got<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.660> done<00:02:22.900> now<00:02:23.310> I'm<00:02:24.310> going<00:02:24.460> to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
so we've got that done now I'm going to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.970 
so we've got that done now I'm going to
find<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:24.940> kind<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> center<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.960> my<00:02:26.770> tie

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
find just kind of the center of my tie

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.650 
find just kind of the center of my tie
here<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:29.050> bring<00:02:30.010> my<00:02:30.190> edges<00:02:30.610> forward<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
here and bring my edges forward and you

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.940 
here and bring my edges forward and you
can<00:02:31.810> kind<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.050> shift<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.440> around<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.860> you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
can kind of shift it around if you

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
can kind of shift it around if you
didn't<00:02:33.190> get<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.370> centered<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.030> easily

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
didn't get it centered you can easily

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.390 
didn't get it centered you can easily
shift<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.930> around<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.380> bit<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.830> know

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
shift it around a little bit you know

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.650 
shift it around a little bit you know
this<00:02:36.580> would<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.850> good<00:02:37.030> way<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.180> preserve<00:02:37.480> a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
this would be a good way to preserve a

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.110 
this would be a good way to preserve a
momento<00:02:38.170> tie<00:02:38.410> -<00:02:38.470> oh<00:02:38.830> definitely<00:02:39.550> or<00:02:39.730> something

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
momento tie - oh definitely or something

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.490 
momento tie - oh definitely or something
I<00:02:40.210> just<00:02:40.270> can't<00:02:40.600> get<00:02:40.780> rid<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.960> that's<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.230> great

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
I just can't get rid of that's a great

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.610 
I just can't get rid of that's a great
idea<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.250> know<00:02:42.430> we'll<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.930> grandfather's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
idea you know we'll have grandfather's

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.740 
idea you know we'll have grandfather's
time<00:02:44.830> exactly<00:02:45.490> from<00:02:46.210> Sunday<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:49.450> right

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
time exactly from Sunday that's right

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.220 
time exactly from Sunday that's right
okay<00:02:50.650> now<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.520> I'm<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.880> do<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:53.020> go

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
okay now what I'm going to do is go

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.760 
okay now what I'm going to do is go
ahead<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.770> pick<00:02:53.980> glue<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.610> inside<00:02:54.640> here

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
ahead and pick glue on the inside here

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.960 
ahead and pick glue on the inside here
there<00:02:56.770> again<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.100> don't<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.730> neat

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
there again you don't have to be neat

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.210 
there again you don't have to be neat
and<00:02:58.150> tidy<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.440> you're<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.800> finding<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
and tidy so you're just finding the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.980 
and tidy so you're just finding the
inside<00:03:00.610> edge<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.060> cuff<00:03:01.270> just<00:03:01.450> lining<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
inside edge of the cuff just lining the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.050 
inside edge of the cuff just lining the
inside<00:03:02.080> edge<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.980> cuff<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.610> I'm<00:03:03.850> gonna

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
inside edge of the cuff and I'm gonna

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.900 
inside edge of the cuff and I'm gonna
start<00:03:04.270> folding<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.870> over<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.460> like<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> fold

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
start folding it over and I like to fold

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.380 
start folding it over and I like to fold
over<00:03:07.150> my<00:03:07.270> ends<00:03:07.630> first<00:03:09.060> kind<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.120> get<00:03:10.240> those

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
over my ends first kind of get those

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.560 
over my ends first kind of get those
secure<00:03:10.930> okay<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.770> then<00:03:12.310> start<00:03:13.410> folding<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
secure okay and then start folding the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.650 
secure okay and then start folding the
edges<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.120> need<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.540> can

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
edges and if you need to you can

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.240 
edges and if you need to you can
actually<00:03:19.810> bend<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.380> cuff<00:03:20.620> open<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.130> little

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
actually bend this cuff open a little

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.780 
actually bend this cuff open a little
bit<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.940> makes<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.360> little<00:03:22.420> bit<00:03:22.630> easier

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
bit if that makes it a little bit easier

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.430 
bit if that makes it a little bit easier
for<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.910> kind<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.240> get<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.570> this<00:03:25.750> inside

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
for you to kind of get to this inside

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.520 
for you to kind of get to this inside
here<00:03:29.070> okay<00:03:30.100> okay<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.330> I'm<00:03:32.110> gonna<00:03:32.290> take

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
here okay okay and then I'm gonna take

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.640 
here okay okay and then I'm gonna take
my<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.890> edges<00:03:33.480> I'll<00:03:34.480> put<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> little<00:03:35.020> bit<00:03:35.230> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
my little edges I'll put a little bit of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.220 
my little edges I'll put a little bit of
glue<00:03:35.980> on<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.250> inside<00:03:36.310> there<00:03:36.940> as<00:03:37.060> well<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.990> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
glue on the inside there as well and the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.960 
glue on the inside there as well and the
good<00:03:38.350> thing<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.010> glue<00:03:39.370> will<00:03:39.940> dry

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
good thing is is this glue will dry

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.750 
good thing is is this glue will dry
clear<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:41.830> don't<00:03:42.100> really<00:03:42.160> have<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.550> worry

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
clear so I don't really have to worry

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.370 
clear so I don't really have to worry
about<00:03:43.350> if<00:03:44.350> there's<00:03:44.620> any<00:03:44.800> fabric<00:03:45.360> necessarily

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
about if there's any fabric necessarily

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.320 
about if there's any fabric necessarily
know<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:47.590> I've<00:03:47.680> got<00:03:47.860> -<00:03:48.040> are<00:03:48.370> these<00:03:48.580> I've<00:03:49.150> left

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
know what I've got - are these I've left

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.150 
know what I've got - are these I've left
these<00:03:49.450> little<00:03:49.750> tiny<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.230> are<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.500> close<00:03:50.860> pins

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
these little tiny but are so close pins

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.190 
these little tiny but are so close pins
so<00:03:51.730> that'll<00:03:52.060> hold<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.360> together<00:03:52.480> help<00:03:53.020> secure

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
so that'll hold it together help secure

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.430 
so that'll hold it together help secure
it<00:03:53.410> until<00:03:53.890> it's<00:03:54.010> dry<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.670> right<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.810> we

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
it until it's dry all right so we

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.360 
it until it's dry all right so we
basically<00:03:56.740> have<00:03:57.480> idea<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.540> how<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.100> glue<00:04:00.100> and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
basically have idea of how to glue and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.330 
basically have idea of how to glue and
start<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.970> tie<00:04:01.150> base<00:04:01.390> yes<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.260> cuff<00:04:02.440> now

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
start the tie base yes to the cuff now

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.650 
start the tie base yes to the cuff now
the<00:04:03.400> next<00:04:03.820> thing<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.000> you're<00:04:04.240> going<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.510> want

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
the next thing that you're going to want

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.270 
the next thing that you're going to want
to<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:04.870> because<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.260> know<00:04:05.530> we<00:04:05.860> love<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
to do because you know we love to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.850 
to do because you know we love to
embellish<00:04:06.940> as<00:04:07.330> many<00:04:07.630> opportunities<00:04:08.110> as<00:04:08.740> we

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
embellish as many opportunities as we

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.949 
embellish as many opportunities as we
possibly<00:04:09.250> can<00:04:09.550> we're<00:04:10.450> going<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.690> use<00:04:10.810> some

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
possibly can we're going to use some

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.770 
possibly can we're going to use some
wire<00:04:11.170> I'm<00:04:11.530> using<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.950> 24<00:04:12.280> gauge<00:04:12.790> wire<00:04:12.820> and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
wire I'm using a 24 gauge wire and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.440 
wire I'm using a 24 gauge wire and
you're<00:04:14.500> just<00:04:14.680> gonna<00:04:14.830> secure<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.310> just<00:04:16.239> kind<00:04:16.390> of

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
you're just gonna secure it just kind of

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.020 
you're just gonna secure it just kind of
do<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.600> little<00:04:16.890> twist<00:04:17.890> there<00:04:18.130> in<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.640> beginning

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
do a little twist there in the beginning

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.539 
do a little twist there in the beginning
and<00:04:19.150> remember<00:04:19.570> -<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.310> we're<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.460> to

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
and remember - that we're going to

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.219 
and remember - that we're going to
actually<00:04:21.910> insert<00:04:22.240> some<00:04:22.450> foes<00:04:22.660> weights<00:04:22.990> for

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
actually insert some foes weights for

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:23.740 
actually insert some foes weights for
going<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.410> glues

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
going to glues

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.930 
going to glues
first<00:04:24.050> way<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.500> center<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.920> this<00:04:25.100> so<00:04:25.520> these

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
first way to the center of this so these

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.060 
first way to the center of this so these
wires<00:04:26.240> won't<00:04:26.780> show<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.650> doesn't<00:04:27.680> have<00:04:27.980> to

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
wires won't show so it doesn't have to

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.770 
wires won't show so it doesn't have to
be<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.610> doesn't<00:04:28.790> have<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:29.240> beautiful<00:04:29.360> and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
be it doesn't have to be beautiful and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.200 
be it doesn't have to be beautiful and
perfect<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:31.280> course<00:04:31.490> we're<00:04:31.670> using<00:04:31.700> some

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
perfect and of course we're using some

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.540 
perfect and of course we're using some
I'm<00:04:32.720> using<00:04:33.020> some<00:04:33.380> big<00:04:33.560> miyajima<00:04:34.160> crystals

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
I'm using some big miyajima crystals

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.120 
I'm using some big miyajima crystals
here<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.090> we've<00:04:35.330> got<00:04:35.510> some<00:04:35.780> great<00:04:36.020> great<00:04:36.830> shine

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
here so we've got some great great shine

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
here so we've got some great great shine
so<00:04:37.340> I've<00:04:37.400> got<00:04:37.550> one<00:04:37.760> wrap<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.720> begin<00:04:38.960> with<00:04:40.150> take

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
so I've got one wrap to begin with take

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.030 
so I've got one wrap to begin with take
that<00:04:41.390> crystal<00:04:41.810> round<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.290> what<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.440> love<00:04:42.740> too

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
that crystal round and what I love too

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.400 
that crystal round and what I love too
is<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:44.060> course<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.480> faux<00:04:44.660> suede<00:04:44.720> once

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
is that of course the faux suede once

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.050 
is that of course the faux suede once
you<00:04:45.560> glue<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:45.890> in<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.400> kind<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.640> locks<00:04:46.790> these

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
you glue that in it kind of locks these

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.740 
you glue that in it kind of locks these
crystals<00:04:47.570> into<00:04:47.840> place<00:04:49.120> but<00:04:50.120> they<00:04:50.330> still<00:04:50.600> have

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
crystals into place but they still have

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.930 
crystals into place but they still have
some<00:04:50.930> movement<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:52.220> think<00:04:52.490> that's<00:04:52.700> what

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
some movement and I think that's what

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.280 
some movement and I think that's what
just<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.270> it's<00:04:53.390> going<00:04:53.600> really<00:04:53.690> fast<00:04:54.050> to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
just and it's going really fast to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.870 
just and it's going really fast to
string<00:04:54.530> these<00:04:54.650> out<00:04:54.830> because<00:04:55.160> you've<00:04:55.340> put<00:04:55.760> your

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
string these out because you've put your

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.280 
string these out because you've put your
crystals<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.510> wire<00:04:56.690> first<00:04:57.020> right<00:04:59.290> you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
crystals on the wire first right you

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.409 
crystals on the wire first right you
know<00:05:00.410> you<00:05:00.500> can<00:05:00.740> use<00:05:00.890> any<00:05:01.160> crystals<00:05:01.880> or<00:05:02.180> you

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
know you can use any crystals or you

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.260 
know you can use any crystals or you
know<00:05:02.600> embellish<00:05:03.340> any<00:05:04.340> additional<00:05:04.970> way<00:05:05.060> that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
know embellish any additional way that

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.370 
know embellish any additional way that
she<00:05:05.390> went<00:05:05.540> to<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.780> then<00:05:05.840> I'm<00:05:05.990> just<00:05:06.020> going<00:05:06.350> to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
she went to and then I'm just going to

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.770 
she went to and then I'm just going to
bring<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.919> inside<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.760> create<00:05:08.600> just

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
bring it to the inside and create just

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.510 
bring it to the inside and create just
like<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.930> little<00:05:09.140> secure<00:05:09.620> wrap<00:05:09.830> on<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> inside

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
like a little secure wrap on the inside

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.270 
like a little secure wrap on the inside
as<00:05:10.700> well<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.300> then<00:05:12.260> what<00:05:12.680> you'll<00:05:12.860> do

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
as well and then what you'll do

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.670 
as well and then what you'll do
what's<00:05:14.150> nice<00:05:14.300> as<00:05:14.510> this<00:05:14.690> faux<00:05:15.230> suede<00:05:15.290> is

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
what's nice as this faux suede is

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.620 
what's nice as this faux suede is
actually<00:05:16.010> pre-cut<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.880> one<00:05:17.090> in<00:05:17.210> half<00:05:17.419> inch

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
actually pre-cut and one in half inch

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.900 
actually pre-cut and one in half inch
strips<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.560> fit<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.890> back<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.340> fit<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:19.730> all

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
strips so to fit the back to fit so all

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.580 
strips so to fit the back to fit so all
you<00:05:20.150> need<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.330> do<00:05:20.510> is<00:05:20.630> measure<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.260> length

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
you need to do is measure the length

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.830 
you need to do is measure the length
that<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.250> need<00:05:22.580> for<00:05:22.760> your<00:05:22.850> cuff<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.540> there

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
that you need for your cuff and there

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.500 
that you need for your cuff and there
again<00:05:24.080> we're<00:05:24.260> going<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.440> glue<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.860> inside<00:05:25.510> and

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
again we're going to glue the inside and

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.900 
again we're going to glue the inside and
it<00:05:26.660> just<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.140> cover<00:05:27.350> it<00:05:27.530> up<00:05:27.650> perfect<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:28.729> fits

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
it just and cover it up perfect it fits

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.360 
it just and cover it up perfect it fits
really<00:05:29.210> nice<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:29.930> snug<00:05:30.260> on<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.590> inside<00:05:31.010> and

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
really nice and snug on the inside and

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.250 
really nice and snug on the inside and
you<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.120> use<00:05:32.270> those<00:05:32.450> little<00:05:32.660> clothes<00:05:32.930> pins

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
you can use those little clothes pins

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.900 
you can use those little clothes pins
again<00:05:33.620> if<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:33.860> need<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.190> just<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.640> kind<00:05:34.850> of

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
again if you need to just to kind of

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.880 
again if you need to just to kind of
hold<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.150> into<00:05:35.390> place<00:05:35.600> and<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.500> do<00:05:36.710> really

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
hold it into place and you do really

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.710 
hold it into place and you do really
want<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.190> be<00:05:37.280> careful<00:05:37.430> not<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:38.030> get<00:05:38.210> any<00:05:38.270> glue

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
want to be careful not to get any glue

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.330 
want to be careful not to get any glue
on<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.960> top<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.500> your<00:05:39.590> faux<00:05:39.770> suede<00:05:39.830> though

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
on the top of your faux suede though

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.360 
on the top of your faux suede though
because<00:05:40.790> it<00:05:40.910> will<00:05:41.060> kind<00:05:41.330> of<00:05:41.390> leave<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.930> residue

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
because it will kind of leave a residue

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.810 
because it will kind of leave a residue
so<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:44.120> we<00:05:44.300> don't<00:05:44.479> want<00:05:44.630> any<00:05:45.400> nice<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:46.610> soft

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
so and we don't want any nice and soft

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.700 
so and we don't want any nice and soft
to<00:05:46.910> wear<00:05:47.150> -<00:05:47.419> exactly<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:48.320> then<00:05:48.470> you're<00:05:48.620> gonna

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
to wear - exactly so then you're gonna

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.490 
to wear - exactly so then you're gonna

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
product and we're gonna play around a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.730 
product and we're gonna play around a
little<00:05:56.090> bit<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.540> of<00:05:57.020> course<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.350> hotfix

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
little bit this of course the hotfix

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.830 
little bit this of course the hotfix
tool<00:05:58.100> I've<00:05:58.700> got<00:05:58.820> a<00:05:58.850> plugged<00:05:59.150> in<00:05:59.390> it's<00:05:59.600> already

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
tool I've got a plugged in it's already

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.590 
tool I've got a plugged in it's already
heated<00:06:00.169> up<00:06:00.290> we've<00:06:01.190> got<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.550> tip<00:06:01.820> that<00:06:02.300> fits

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
heated up we've got the tip that fits

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.060 
heated up we've got the tip that fits
the<00:06:02.870> size<00:06:03.020> of<00:06:03.260> crystal<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.710> we're<00:06:03.830> going<00:06:03.950> to

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
the size of crystal that we're going to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.320 
the size of crystal that we're going to
use<00:06:04.510> so<00:06:05.510> basically<00:06:06.350> and<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.520> always<00:06:07.820> use<00:06:08.090> a

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
use so basically and I always use a

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.710 
use so basically and I always use a
paper<00:06:08.360> plate<00:06:09.160> because<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.430> surface<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.330> the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
paper plate because the surface of the

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.840 
paper plate because the surface of the
tip<00:06:11.960> is<00:06:12.229> hot<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:13.010> you<00:06:13.130> don't<00:06:13.160> want<00:06:13.430> it<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:13.610> melt

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
tip is hot and you don't want it to melt

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.060 
tip is hot and you don't want it to melt
like<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.120> styrofoam<00:06:14.660> plate<00:06:14.930> for<00:06:15.350> your<00:06:15.500> beef<00:06:15.800> mat

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
like a styrofoam plate for your beef mat

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.890 
like a styrofoam plate for your beef mat
or<00:06:16.280> anything<00:06:16.460> like<00:06:16.940> your<00:06:17.120> work<00:06:17.300> surface<00:06:17.840> you

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
or anything like your work surface you

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.870 
or anything like your work surface you
want<00:06:18.110> to<00:06:18.260> protect<00:06:18.560> your<00:06:18.680> work<00:06:18.740> surface

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
want to protect your work surface

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.670 
want to protect your work surface

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
kind of heating up you can see the glue

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.420 
kind of heating up you can see the glue
start<00:06:23.990> to<00:06:24.140> bubble<00:06:24.320> you<00:06:24.560> can<00:06:24.590> and<00:06:25.100> that's<00:06:25.190> what

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
it just the glue is gonna stick to the

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.650 
it just the glue is gonna stick to the
cuff<00:06:44.350> and<00:06:44.710> just<00:06:45.490> drop<00:06:45.790> right<00:06:46.120> there

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
cuff and just drop right there

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.750 
cuff and just drop right there
um<00:06:46.900> what's<00:06:47.350> kind<00:06:47.920> of<00:06:48.010> fun<00:06:48.160> too<00:06:48.340> is<00:06:48.460> that<00:06:48.610> these

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
um what's kind of fun too is that these

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.720 
um what's kind of fun too is that these
crystals<00:06:49.060> just<00:06:49.560> kind<00:06:50.560> of<00:06:50.620> stick<00:06:50.950> very<00:06:51.520> easily

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
crystals just kind of stick very easily

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.090 
crystals just kind of stick very easily
up<00:06:52.180> in<00:06:52.390> here<00:06:52.720> if<00:06:52.900> you<00:06:53.080> need<00:06:53.260> to<00:06:53.320> kind<00:06:54.010> of

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
up in here if you need to kind of

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.710 
up in here if you need to kind of
sometimes<00:06:54.700> you<00:06:54.940> need<00:06:55.090> to<00:06:55.150> pry<00:06:55.450> it<00:06:55.510> out<00:06:55.660> a

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
sometimes you need to pry it out a

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.940 
sometimes you need to pry it out a
little<00:06:55.960> bit<00:06:56.140> so<00:06:56.170> I've<00:06:56.380> got<00:06:56.530> just<00:06:56.680> like<00:06:56.920> a

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
little bit so I've got just like a

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.550 
little bit so I've got just like a
little<00:06:57.220> tiny<00:06:57.670> tiny<00:06:58.060> pair<00:06:58.390> of<00:06:58.480> tweezers<00:06:58.690> that

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
little tiny tiny pair of tweezers that

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.200 
little tiny tiny pair of tweezers that
helps<00:06:59.860> you<00:06:59.950> kind<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.190> loosen<00:07:00.520> that<00:07:00.640> crystal<00:07:01.120> up

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
helps you kind of loosen that crystal up

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.670 
helps you kind of loosen that crystal up
because<00:07:01.390> there's<00:07:01.540> little<00:07:01.810> slits<00:07:02.170> on<00:07:02.620> both

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
because there's little slits on both

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.850 
because there's little slits on both
sides<00:07:03.430> of<00:07:03.820> the<00:07:04.330> tip<00:07:04.600> so<00:07:04.900> it<00:07:05.500> just<00:07:05.680> kind<00:07:05.830> of
