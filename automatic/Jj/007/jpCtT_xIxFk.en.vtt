because<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.500> honesty<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.520> might

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because in all honesty I know it might

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
because in all honesty I know it might
seem<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.150> helps<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.110> just

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
seem like it helps but it really just

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
seem like it helps but it really just
makes<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.799> want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> record<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.490> because

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
makes me not want to record it because

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.130 
makes me not want to record it because
it<00:01:36.000> feels<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.509> aren't<00:01:36.659> enjoying<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it feels like you aren't enjoying the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.390 
it feels like you aren't enjoying the
other<00:01:37.290> videos<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.680> uploading<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.280> might

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
other videos of uploading and that might

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840 
other videos of uploading and that might
be<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> case<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.240> I'd<00:01:39.869> rather<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.579> know

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
be the case but I'd rather just not know

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.480 
be the case but I'd rather just not know
that<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.540> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.079> tell<00:01:43.350> me<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
what set me apart from other people I
guess<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.829> was<00:02:43.980> super<00:02:44.310> afraid<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.700> those<00:02:44.819> mods

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
guess I was super afraid of those mods

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.819 
guess I was super afraid of those mods
so<00:02:45.329> it<00:02:45.629> kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> made<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> video<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.470> lot<00:02:46.650> more

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
so it kind of made the video a lot more

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.830 
so it kind of made the video a lot more
entertaining<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.340> both<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.299> me<00:02:48.540> because

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
entertaining for both you and me because

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.690 
entertaining for both you and me because
it<00:02:49.140> was<00:02:49.290> fun<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> record<00:02:50.040> things<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.400> guess<00:02:50.579> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
it was fun to record things I guess I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.099 
it was fun to record things I guess I
really<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.390> adrenaline<00:02:51.569> with<00:02:51.930> horror

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
really like the adrenaline with horror

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.930 
really like the adrenaline with horror
games<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:52.530> never<00:02:52.920> realized<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.579> as<00:02:53.760> much

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
games I just never realized that as much

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000 
games I just never realized that as much
until<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.269> started<00:02:54.629> actually<00:02:54.780> playing<00:02:55.170> actual

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
until I started actually playing actual

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.349 
until I started actually playing actual
horror<00:02:56.250> games<00:02:56.519> which<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.879> something<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.299> do

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
horror games which is something I do

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.930

terrible<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.700> guys<00:03:23.760> probably<00:03:24.030> don't<00:03:24.239> know

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
terrible you guys probably don't know

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.400 
terrible you guys probably don't know
that<00:03:24.599> because<00:03:24.780> I've<00:03:24.900> never<00:03:25.049> really<00:03:25.230> mentioned

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
that because I've never really mentioned

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.870 
that because I've never really mentioned
it<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.919> just<00:03:26.099> terrible<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.639> takes<00:03:26.790> me

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
it but it's just terrible it takes me

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.030 
it but it's just terrible it takes me
forever<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.239> upload<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.919> of<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
forever to upload so that's one of the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.039 
forever to upload so that's one of the
problems<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.669> I<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.660> think<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.989> could

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
problems that I have but I think I could

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.509

I<00:03:45.090> haven't<00:03:45.780> really<00:03:45.959> live<00:03:46.139> stream<00:03:46.380> for<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.590> while

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
I haven't really live stream for a while

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.559 
I haven't really live stream for a while
primarily<00:03:47.489> because<00:03:47.849> what<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.090> used<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.329> live

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
primarily because what I used to live

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.170 
primarily because what I used to live
she<00:03:48.720> when<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.930> time<00:03:49.079> was<00:03:49.169> minecraft<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:50.180> do

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
she when the time was minecraft I do

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.430 
she when the time was minecraft I do
want<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.630> if<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.810> can<00:03:51.930> start<00:03:52.079> doing<00:03:52.290> live

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
want to see if I can start doing live

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.900 
want to see if I can start doing live
streams<00:03:52.709> again<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.130> thought<00:03:53.459> about<00:03:53.639> doing

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
streams again I thought about doing

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.220 
streams again I thought about doing
things<00:03:54.239> like<00:03:54.329> charity<00:03:54.720> live<00:03:54.959> scene<00:03:55.139> so<00:03:55.200> I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
things like charity live scene so I

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.050 
things like charity live scene so I
think<00:03:55.290> that'd<00:03:55.470> be<00:03:55.560> really<00:03:55.680> cool<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.639> give<00:03:56.790> back

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
think that'd be really cool to give back

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180 
think that'd be really cool to give back
to<00:03:57.299> people<00:03:57.480> who<00:03:57.660> really<00:03:58.079> need<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.980> money

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
to people who really need the money

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.530 
to people who really need the money
rather<00:03:59.519> than<00:03:59.639> just<00:03:59.940> getting<00:04:00.120> money<00:04:00.359> for

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
rather than just getting money for

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.000 
rather than just getting money for
myself<00:04:00.840> because<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.109> don't<00:04:01.169> really<00:04:01.440> need<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.650> I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
myself because I don't really need it I

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.559 
myself because I don't really need it I
think<00:04:02.489> that'd<00:04:02.579> be<00:04:02.609> something<00:04:02.910> cool<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.359> but

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
think that'd be something cool to do but

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.729 
think that'd be something cool to do but
that's<00:04:03.690> something<00:04:03.900> I'd<00:04:04.049> also<00:04:04.200> have<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.410> find<00:04:04.620> a

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.080 
that's something I'd also have to find a
lot<00:04:04.829> more<00:04:04.889> time<00:04:05.310> for<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.639> don't<00:04:05.700> know<00:04:05.790> how<00:04:05.910> often
