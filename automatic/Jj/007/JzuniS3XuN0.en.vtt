00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.830
 and well only ten years I hope that 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.600
 you're well we end up 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.309
 today for the 7th tutorial of the 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.289
 team dessoude kraft on the theme of 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.299
 anatomy so that's a very theme 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.570
 particular on which I had a 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.310
 creation of violent is however 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.390
 a combination of circumstances that 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.890
 I took a rather particular turn 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.930
 in the sense that I 'm not going to talk to you 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.720
 of something in front of very important 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.730
 and educate you on it in the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.770
 sense where 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.210
 did not know I think you will not be 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 not how to react once absolutely 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.739
 know how to react knowing that this is 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.579
 very simple so I will not deny 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.579
 the stroke 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.570
 nice the avc is simply a 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.680
 the accident 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.840
 cerebrovascular 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.540
 to make your brain basically simple 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.290
 stop being irrigated to a certain 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.090
 place that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.310
 gives you symptoms like 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.610
 I was able to use your arm properly 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.019
 you have your face twitching like this 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.370
 of things you will put all the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.960
 additional information in bar 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.790
 info here is looped please 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 but level will read it's very very 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.220
 very important 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 and in fact it's very simple is that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 you see that at someone's house if you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.070
 you notice at home too 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.100
 arrive 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.310
 able to call on the 15th do it is 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.280
 really made the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.960
 I prefer to call you for nothing 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.240
 that do not apply 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.409
 because after that it's very simple 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.350
 nobody 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.750
 get together and paraplegic trades 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.600
 to the muzzling father of his legs from his 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.900
 not his hands of speech will be able 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.870
 maybe never again eaten 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.800
 that's destroyed it destroyed a family 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.800
 it destroys a couple 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.520
 as soon as you see the symptoms that I 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.530
 have you described there are others so 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.700
 everything and towards Darfur that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.710
 know the most information 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.180
 complete especially especially especially 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.190
 call on the 15th 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.110
 you have four hours to do it and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.670
 that the person is cared for and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 not necessarily things we know 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.330
 but now here I hope it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.310
 will be able to help you the day you will have 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.290
 need because that's it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.989
 on it's the first cause of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.700
 disability in adults in France so 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.930
 it can fall on you 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.959
 not that you can talk about it 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.060
 so that's it please think about that 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.470
 and just remember that if you see 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.990
 something abnormal in someone 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.730
 even if you 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.470
 no do not call firefighters were 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.690

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.840

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.250
 the rock group was taking experience 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.180
 you see something that is wrong 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.730
 call local 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.069
 keystone painting because 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.010

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.810
 booth and the world 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.069
 especially to that please 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.550
 the remains had a doubt you 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.750
 had 15 subscribers are obviously 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.459

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.660

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.550
 elementary 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.300
 do it so this tutorial turns around 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.830
 obviously of the avc and as I 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.000

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.819
 a brain and hacker is also the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.360
 sentence or in any case these two words act 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.739
 quick 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.239
