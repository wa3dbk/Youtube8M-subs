00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
reason I started one hair extensions

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.460 
reason I started one hair extensions
because<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:54.300> got<00:04:54.480> it<00:04:54.600> cut<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.110> could<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.290> look

up to here and I was gonna cry fact I
right<00:04:57.990> hair<00:04:58.200> extensions<00:04:58.770> because<00:05:00.380> short<00:05:01.380> hair

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
right hair extensions because short hair

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.470 
right hair extensions because short hair
doesn't<00:05:01.710> look<00:05:01.740> good<00:05:01.920> on<00:05:02.070> me<00:05:04.040> I<00:05:05.120> mean<00:05:06.120> as<00:05:06.210> far<00:05:06.360> as

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
I'm concerned obviously not all the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.810 
I'm concerned obviously not all the
hairs<00:05:08.100> have<00:05:08.370> this<00:05:09.050> it's<00:05:10.050> only<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.530> few<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:11.280> once

those go away the rocks with hair should

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.330 
those go away the rocks with hair should
be<00:05:13.560> good<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:15.440> if<00:05:16.440> you're<00:05:16.650> gonna<00:05:16.770> buy<00:05:16.980> i<00:05:17.010> guess

i would go with pro extensions just

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.730 
i would go with pro extensions just
because<00:05:18.960> i<00:05:19.020> haven't<00:05:19.170> heard<00:05:19.320> anything<00:05:19.530> bad
