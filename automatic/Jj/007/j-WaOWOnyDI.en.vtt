00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.850
 m 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.119
 the Americans which means that I have sought these same ones by the way 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.570
 olive patients 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.180
 for those looking for a director% I knew I had no 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.849
 All the time 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.439
 really so I went on sale 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.669
 here we are going to see 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.789
 he read his text in fact he did not even play we landed two hours and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.200
 even his text 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.730
 and I was laughing 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.330
 and m of the coup I said to myself let's go end here I'm going to take the time to do 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.560
 two daughters-in-law a helping hand because that's hyper courage what he did 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.140
 write a show like this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 we saw each other 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560
 I thought since June I believe at the same time we do a lot 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.350
 but firm 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.350
 mike ten sessions of about three hours 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.810
 we talk a lot yet what is written 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.220
 so it's true that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.080
 the moci so I try to see them arrive on a little indications 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.040
 % we worked first in the direction of the show viacom took over this spar 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.140
 sketch 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.960
 and there we went into the details and all that but as invincible 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.259
 asolument hallucinating home cqfd believe that a note 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.330
 nor absolutely holds all that you say it is to say that the la I tell you a 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.549
 trick these four pages of notes the session but after all terrain 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.030
 he memorized everything so that proves his interest in standing 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.040
 you take that very seriously what rhymes what is super easy to work 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.950
 with him 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.900
 it's just more 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.490
 some young actors 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 % a faculty of improvisation that makes it always catch up 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.190
 changes blowing no worries 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.170
 he has a sweet potato that's on the tray and then I made the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 show and do rehearsals from my friends one who hate and myself 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.010
 but really why it does not laugh for a second she loved it 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.400
 he notes that a little more in the same frame as me and the same so that I 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.990
 think that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.450
 I do not worry about the emitter of the depression phases except 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.810
 that these primaries we lost it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.860
 % I think he's stressed 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.330
 narbonne 12 like all comedians there I think the only thing that him 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.389
 lack it's all public vaclav klaus regling 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.709
 I will not make you laugh 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.560
 g city and barbara who before going on stage referred 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.419
 and I enter the lion's den 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:27.159
 it's my life rim has reasons I'm afraid that people come back anyway because gm 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.529
 I think the vote was a passionate actress 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.009
 ah it's more part of the basement
