00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
drive especially when it's upgraded so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.670 
drive especially when it's upgraded so
let's<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.439> get

early Japanese car it's really really
nice<00:04:03.130> at<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.640> one<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.510> was<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> livestream

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
nice at this one I was in the livestream

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.470 
nice at this one I was in the livestream
driving<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.520> for<00:04:06.790> probably<00:04:06.940> longer<00:04:07.360> than

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
driving this for probably longer than

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.330 
driving this for probably longer than
all<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.720> other<00:04:07.870> cars<00:04:08.140> this<00:04:08.380> one<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.770> really

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
all the other cars this one is really

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.360 
all the other cars this one is really
really<00:04:09.520> good<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.790> drift<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:11.260> like<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:12.040> said<00:04:12.100> in

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
really good to drift it like I said in

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.250 
really good to drift it like I said in
the<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.790> first<00:04:13.000> video<00:04:13.210> it<00:04:13.510> seems<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.900> lot<00:04:14.110> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
the in the first video it seems a lot of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.920 
the in the first video it seems a lot of
the<00:04:14.320> cars<00:04:14.560> now<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.880> they've<00:04:16.030> added<00:04:16.269> have

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
the cars now that they've added have

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.199 
the cars now that they've added have
very<00:04:17.920> very<00:04:18.310> different<00:04:18.459> handling

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
very very different handling

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.170 
very very different handling
characteristics<00:04:19.920> they<00:04:20.920> they<00:04:21.280> just<00:04:21.520> slip<00:04:21.940> and

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
characteristics they they just slip and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.210 
characteristics they they just slip and
slide<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.690> lot<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.230> they're<00:04:23.380> very<00:04:23.620> very<00:04:23.890> fun<00:04:24.100> to

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
slide a lot and they're very very fun to

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.970 
slide a lot and they're very very fun to
drive<00:04:24.340> even<00:04:24.940> though<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.210> does<00:04:25.500> slip<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.680> slide

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
drive even though it does slip and slide

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.550 
drive even though it does slip and slide
a<00:04:27.010> lot<00:04:27.250> it's<00:04:27.520> still<00:04:27.910> quite<00:04:28.380> controllable<00:04:29.380> if

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
a lot it's still quite controllable if

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.070 
a lot it's still quite controllable if
you<00:04:29.680> just<00:04:29.980> want<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.310> drive<00:04:30.700> fast<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.450> weave

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
you just want to drive fast and weave

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.020 
you just want to drive fast and weave
through<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.500> traffic<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:33.160> if<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.760> want<00:04:33.940> to

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
through the traffic but if you want to

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.600 
through the traffic but if you want to
just<00:04:34.180> stab<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.930> handbrake<00:04:35.410> slide<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.400> around

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
just stab the handbrake slide it around

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.880 
just stab the handbrake slide it around
a<00:04:36.760> corner<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.450> quite<00:04:37.900> fun<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.710> with

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
a corner it is quite fun to do that with

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.140 
a corner it is quite fun to do that with
it<00:04:38.980> and<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.280> something<00:04:39.610> I've<00:04:39.880> sort<00:04:40.120> of

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
it and that is something I've sort of

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.380 
it and that is something I've sort of
found<00:04:41.550> quite<00:04:42.550> difficult<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.940> do<00:04:43.090> with<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> lot

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
found quite difficult to do with a lot

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.660 
found quite difficult to do with a lot
of<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.540> cars<00:04:43.750> in<00:04:43.900> GTA<00:04:44.230> when<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.830> when<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.490> try

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
of the cars in GTA when you when you try

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.040 
of the cars in GTA when you when you try
and<00:04:45.730> slide<00:04:46.090> them<00:04:46.210> around<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.510> corner<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:46.960> then

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
and slide them around a corner and then

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.660 
and slide them around a corner and then
correct<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.620> they'll<00:04:47.830> just<00:04:48.010> sort<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.340> snap

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
correct it they'll just sort of snap

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.240 
correct it they'll just sort of snap
back<00:04:48.940> like<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.260> snaps<00:04:50.620> back<00:04:50.860> but<00:04:51.100> this

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
back like that that snaps back but this

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.610 
back like that that snaps back but this
one<00:04:51.460> can<00:04:51.760> hold<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.720> bit<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.050> drift<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.470> bit

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
one can hold a bit of a drift a bit

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.960 
one can hold a bit of a drift a bit
better<00:04:53.800> than<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.040> lot<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.370> other<00:04:54.520> cars<00:04:54.820> but

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
better than a lot of the other cars but

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.210 
better than a lot of the other cars but
very<00:04:55.390> very<00:04:55.660> fun<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:55.990> drive<00:04:56.140> so<00:04:56.860> like<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.160> said

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
very very fun to drive so like I said

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.690 
very very fun to drive so like I said
this<00:04:57.490> one<00:04:57.730> is<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.300> Warriner<00:04:59.220> very<00:05:00.220> very<00:05:00.550> nice

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
this one is the Warriner very very nice

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.420 
this one is the Warriner very very nice
little<00:05:00.940> car<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.530> very<00:05:02.530> very<00:05:02.800> Japanese

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
little car and very very Japanese

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.659 
little car and very very Japanese
inspired<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.690> think<00:05:05.500> if<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:06.040> could<00:05:06.250> get<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.490> bit

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
inspired I think if you could get a bit

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.260 
inspired I think if you could get a bit
of<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.820> team<00:05:07.200> together<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.790> form<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.090> bit<00:05:10.180> of

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
of a team together and and form a bit of

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.360 
of a team together and and form a bit of
a<00:05:10.360> drift<00:05:10.600> team<00:05:10.840> definitely<00:05:11.770> take<00:05:11.980> a<00:05:12.010> couple<00:05:12.250> of

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
a drift team definitely take a couple of

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.130 
a drift team definitely take a couple of
these<00:05:12.490> up<00:05:12.730> into<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.060> twisty<00:05:13.450> roads<00:05:13.690> up<00:05:13.930> into

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
these up into the twisty roads up into

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.510 
these up into the twisty roads up into
the<00:05:14.230> mountains<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:15.010> could<00:05:15.130> probably<00:05:15.250> get

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
the mountains and you could probably get

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.310 
the mountains and you could probably get
a<00:05:15.550> couple<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.910> drift<00:05:16.120> videos<00:05:16.450> together<00:05:17.110> I

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
a couple of drift videos together I

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.570 
a couple of drift videos together I
might<00:05:17.500> get<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.800> crew<00:05:17.980> together<00:05:18.130> we<00:05:18.400> might

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
might get the crew together we might

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.490 
might get the crew together we might
even<00:05:18.790> try<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.480> anyway<00:05:20.140> that<00:05:20.320> was<00:05:20.350> the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
even try that but anyway that was the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.120 
even try that but anyway that was the
Warriner

Warriner

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.340
