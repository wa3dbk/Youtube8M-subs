00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.800
 good guys and girls is already very 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.600
 little bit to enjoy metal gear 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.189
 solid 5 the phantom paint and follow 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.900
 leaving a lot of news a lot 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.640
 information and this time we are going to 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.490
 something that may not like the whole world 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.860
 especially to me he throws me very 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.410
 back the issue of micropayments in a 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.300
 game like this attentive because thanks to 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.789
 gamespot has been able to know that the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.789
 construction of our base fv that 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.439
 will be part of the pvp of the game we are going to 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.569
 that is to say that next to our mother 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.519
 beige we will be able to build this base 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.440
 and assign resources that we have acquired 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.660
 through story mode to 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.730
 defend it or attack other bases 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 players through online mode 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.470
 according to the well-known website 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.990
 gamespot we would use the coin called 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.450
 md to be able to buy space for 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.760
 develop the forward operating goes to 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.430
 to be to give you forgiveness 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.640
 fv and these coins could be obtained 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.230
 through real currency a long time ago 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.180
 rumored with the possibility that the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 game had micro transactions for 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.590
 the beige mother plus the web page 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.780
 Italian playstation store official 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.920
 included in the description of the game a 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.890
 title a type 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 in optional microtransactions already 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.119
 we will see if finally the title has 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.369
 that microtransaction system in 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.040
 some of its slopes although all 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.380
 indicates and it seems that it will be like this 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.570
 Of course it is news that 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.649
 moment you have to catch it with clues but 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.440
 the game is just around the corner 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.180
 let's not forget and well I do not know if this 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.070
 micropayments system so to speak 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.710
 konami would be introducing it and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.500
 precisely this was one of the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.200
 questions by which Mr. kojima 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.600
 he also got pissed off with the company 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590
 some time ago anyway I think 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.179
 that when the games on the street 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.819
 we will know what has happened 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.679
 really between kojima the company everything 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.450
 what is behind and what is the approach 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.580
 that you want to give the game I hope that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.380
 at least the story mode do not touch it and 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.450
 how good they leave it, just like the man 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.850
 Kojima has already told us 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.130
 manufactured to us we will not make more 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.649
 pending more information but from 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.200
 then take advantage of anything to 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.200
 get extra money this is a reality
