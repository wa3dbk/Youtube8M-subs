you're thinking to get a garage door
that<00:03:43.510> looks<00:03:43.600> exactly<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.290> must<00:03:44.650> cost<00:03:44.860> a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
that looks exactly it must cost a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.310 
that looks exactly it must cost a
fortune<00:03:45.070> but<00:03:45.610> apparently<00:03:46.180> that's<00:03:46.810> not<00:03:47.110> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
fortune but apparently that's not the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.940 
fortune but apparently that's not the
case<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.030> when<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.120> were<00:03:49.240> back<00:03:49.420> at<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.290> wood

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
case so when we were back at the wood

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.340 
case so when we were back at the wood
door<00:03:51.280> or<00:03:51.790> even<00:03:51.820> like<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.810> character<00:03:53.140> style

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
door or even like the character style

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.230 
door or even like the character style
style<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.890> showed<00:03:54.130> or<00:03:54.610> even<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
style you showed or even the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.330 
style you showed or even the
contemporary<00:03:55.660> one<00:03:55.810> yeah<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.380> don't<00:03:56.800> see<00:03:57.160> those

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
contemporary one yeah I don't see those

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.790 
contemporary one yeah I don't see those
in<00:03:57.550> normal<00:03:57.850> houses<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:59.200> because<00:03:59.560> the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
in normal houses is that because the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.130 
in normal houses is that because the
price<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.160> just<00:04:00.280> way<00:04:00.610> too<00:04:00.670> high<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.390> people<00:04:01.810> to

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
price is just way too high for people to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.690 
price is just way too high for people to
be<00:04:02.230> able<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.440> afford<00:04:02.650> or<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.520> just<00:04:03.670> that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
be able to afford or is it just that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.370 
be able to afford or is it just that
they<00:04:03.850> don't<00:04:03.970> know<00:04:04.150> about<00:04:04.240> it<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:05.020> really

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
they don't know about it it's really

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380 
they don't know about it it's really
because<00:04:05.650> they<00:04:05.740> don't<00:04:05.920> know<00:04:06.040> about<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.550> the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
because they don't know about it the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.330 
because they don't know about it the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
doors are not that expensive especially

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.160 
doors are not that expensive especially
when<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.970> look<00:04:10.150> at<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.420> impact<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.020> has

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
when you look at the impact that it has

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.620
