00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.500
 with regard to the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.270
 we can understand that vegetarian is 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.320
 that person who does not consume 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.939
 any type 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.189
 then who consumes white meat for 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.020
 example fish or chicken is not 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.599
 vegetarian the digital newspaper does not exclude 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.879
 all kinds of meat in your diet 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.430
 replacing the meat is quite simple 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.320
 practical way 100 grams of meat are 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.470
 exchanged for a bean shell 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.120
 I leave this graphic we discuss a 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.680
 A little touching here for you 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.750
 meat substitutions 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.629
 so we have a left side to 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.510
 quantity in grams of meat and which 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.600
 its replacement type in terms of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.979
 group of practical beans 100 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.180
 grams of meat is a bean ladle 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.619
 or 7 tablespoons of cooked beans 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.510
 but within the vegetarian diet there is 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.909
 some other classifications that 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.460
 people can then use an individual 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.130
 can for example be the lacto-oval egg 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.320
 vegetarian or is it the vegetarian that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.150
 also uses eggs and dairy products 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.490
 it can exclude eggs from its 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.950
 power it will be called lacto 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.650
 vegetarian ie they use the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.810
 dairy products but not the eggs and obviously 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.580
 not the faces 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.260
 there is another classification that is 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.480
 less common to find but is an individual 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.400
 that he will remove Latinos from his 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.130
 and will keep the eggs 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.770
 it is the vegetarian egg use eggs and 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.140
 other foods the vegetable kingdom 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.990
 there is another group that is growing 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 more that is the strict vegetarian because 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.240
 he is strictly vegetarian or 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 he does not use eggs or latinas in his 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 diet and within this same pattern of 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.390
 no power derived from 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.990
 animal has what we call seeing 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.260
 Ghana 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.460
 the veganism he professionally 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.320
 will follow the same vegetarian diet 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.900
 strict only that he will also look for 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.539
 in your day to day use nothing that 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.450
 from the animals 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.290
 so he will not use some products 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.580
 with wool vest will not wear cosmetics 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.590
 that have been tested on animals or 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.810
 have animal substances then this 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.690
 classification is enough that we have 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.060
 it induces to error very great it induces 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.569
 to the error that the withdrawal of some 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.239
 these some of these groups 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.700
 may cause some shortcomings by 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.439
 example is how a person thinks that in the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.609
 time you took Latinos on a diet 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.650
 you will have a calcium deficiency 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.999
 or at the time you took the eggs out of 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.560
 You will lose a lot of your diet. 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.840
 protein consumption 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.790
 This is a myth of the following when 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.379
 people evaluated the plant kingdom 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.670
 it is composed of several compound 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.560
 different groups 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.620
 also the vegetable kingdom I have the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.169
 cereal rice corn wheat rye is that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.540
 can be either whole or refined 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.760
 we have the potatoes and there goes the goiânia 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.639
 to face the little sweet potato 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.859
 we have the vegetables carrot pumpkin 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.699
 eggplant we have the vegetables 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.219
 the clan cabbage cress we have the fruits 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:14.129
 all fresh or dried we have the 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.379
 regions are the group of legumes and 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.409
 this then all regions peas 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.469
 lentils chickpeas tofu can 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.199
 enter and we also have oleaginous 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.389
 walnuts almonds pistachio nuts 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.909
 we have several vegetable condiments and 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.799
 we have group of eyes that can be 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.590
 also used what is interesting 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.419
 here in this universe of food 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.739
 one can combine this in ways 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.419
 very different 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.099
 a person may for example chose 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.310
 make a meal be vegetarian 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.859
 not high in food 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.159
 processed white cereals on white 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.870
 white bread is sweet soda that she 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.879
 you are using these foods in a way that 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.349
 less healthy it can make a 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.359
 combination will already use the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.519
 integrates beats everything that is processed 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.889
 and she can still use those elements 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.419
 with completely different proportions 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.519
 You can make a plate of beans with 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.989
 rice or beans with the fall of 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.479
 proportion you choose 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.000
 so what will determine the quantity 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.250
 The amount of time you take is the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.819
 that you combine a food and not that 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.009
 label 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.840
 this label lacto-vegetarian egg 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.549
 lacto vegetarian written 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.039
 it will be to see the one and only 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.349
 that the health professional can know 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.180
 What will he or she prescribe or not? 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:31.080
 It's time to set up a menu for you. 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.060
 is defined in situations where you 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.130
 I mean, do you mean what you mean? 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.409
 eats in their daily lives but in terms of 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.349
 nutritional quality and optional health 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.469
 these values ​​if titles they do not say 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.469
 anything
