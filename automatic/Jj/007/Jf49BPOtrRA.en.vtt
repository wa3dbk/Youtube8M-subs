00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.890
 and now everything is stuck here we are 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.890
 eric cantona 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.550
 and the men's consumables 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.820
 she goodnight you're fine you're fine 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.579
 yes well then Eric goodnight you have 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.430
 said recently in the TV figaro I 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.379
 do not like to show me on TV and for 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.930
 my film coming out soon I will not go 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.890
 where I do not want to go then that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.550
 we are pleased that you are here 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.579
 because that is to say that they had 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.329
 want to come in a certain way 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.000
 it's not what I prefer 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.070
 yeah but y'a really stuff 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.030
 I do not want to pass what 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.519
 crappy shows where you do not feel like 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.470
 to go 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.150
 it's emissions I'm not suspicious 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.670
 a lot of television with cantona 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.500
 especially television actually 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 as they say 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.979
 you say if we look at it more than ten 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.020
 minutes we will stay in front for a 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.369
 hour because it hangs cc 1 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.170
 but I think we are 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.000
 quickly gets used to fast broadband 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.439
 know alike and it's a trap 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.150
 because it's studied on the 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.740
 psychology of people like that and that if 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.610
 we stay more than ten minutes but 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.590
 more than ten seconds 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.210
 we stay taped at the end of the show 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.369
 wondered what invokes because 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 we've learned and it's kind of like 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.680
 of magazine 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 I 'm not the stuff here you fall 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.660
 above all we are all a little voyeur and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
 finally we learn nothing and need it 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.380
 have to flee it's hard 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.450
 oh yes it's me it's my thing that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220
 I love but we agree with him 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 we always make it sure if we do not 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.390
 you still take a crampon shot in 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 shut up with eric 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 I agree with Eric well 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.020
 so tonight I want to tell you 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.270
 we do not get the genius of football 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 not at all not the one whose 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 career was broken by the Bulgarian 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.380
 kostadinov and backgammon was not 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.030
 the one we get from eric cantona ma 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 career was broken by the barons 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.750
 kostadinov louis lefranc bulgaria 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.640
 did not have it from america i have a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.770
 career lasts 15 years and less missed 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.390
 what bah yes jacques is as good we go 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.390
 not go back on it but hey we are not 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.650
 not here to talk about that we'll talk about 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.239
 my walks there is for you to me 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 speak and this passion the life of in 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.709
 to speak new york victory is a pleasure 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 it's that I say it's good I'm not going 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.489
 not to lie down yes I do not want to lie down 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.489
 extend it everywhere 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.549
 in my part is not going anyway we're going 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.019
 talking about jacques is good and we got 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.260
 barrel to the road 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.510
 that's the world at 98 would not have passed 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.790
 as in France and the total cost to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.260
 quÃ©bec but for me the fault to Jacques 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.510
 and the drool because finally we're not going 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.560
 talk about it so not only that but there is 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.180
 still a serious trick 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.109
 no but after we talk about it later 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.579
 but it's over but it's 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:09.680
 true that I welcome arrives me there 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.290
 would have a young demo story 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.669
 jacques and comes in the shade here are some 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.590
 names but it's true he's coming to see you 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.519
 in England for so here's for 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.500
 discuss with you this 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.269
 participation in the world cup and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.379
 you were in a party that you 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.669
 arrive with two hours late 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 what I mean is that even if he 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.430
 came there to tell you yes they had 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.530
 no longer want to tell you yes here is everything 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.849
 what I meant I do not think so 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.849
 he came to tell me yes that's good 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.239
 it does not matter but the Bavarian in 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.200
 bristles washed not to tell you yes 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.139
 it happened like that went very well 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.280
 gone away all that we're less a talkative 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.359
 did not want us to dig a little deeper 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.699
 that's what I do not understand we do 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.650
 and I do not speak to you 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:50.569
 that's why no but it's true 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.430
 why jacquet estimated that France 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.079
 would be stronger without you here it is 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.000
 something I never understood how 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.470
 can think when we are breeder 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.090
 France football team that 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.220
 the team will be stronger without eric 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.750
 cantona that's it's a thing I've 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.939
 never understood me the best is that you 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.530
 is a backgammon but no but he 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.639
 do not speak on it I read his 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.689
 book that's where they said they were 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.250
 went to see england besides I 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.720
 read the book jack and he does not express himself 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.819
 on it he never explained why 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.680
 it is true I have not read this bouquet 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.590
 did not want him to say well this is 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.720
 true they talk about you what do you think 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.220
 the france team today i am 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.780
 more too the name 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.849
 it's crazy even if you imagine that it has 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.740
 been practically bigger players the 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.530
 world 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.460
 I understand but when I could 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.449
 take back something that could we 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.979
 serve 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.330
 Mongrain for my career but 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.930
 today I watched that why 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.270
 I have more fun 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.800
 the drowning office there are other things 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.029
 that it is necessary to advance but bah listen on 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.620
