00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.790
 The wafer is 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.170
 House on the interior whether Danbara Well I Have you reviewed in the past 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 I saw this break joker for the first time playing black with smartphone and card 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.020
 It seems to be Jack Fu Kamen Rider card game 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.360
 What kind of thing is it? The hidden area lineup is such a visa 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.060
 Since it was Atotoka beast or Kamen Rider 1 package worth two in the Toka No. 2 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.060
 I bought two and I think that I want to check the contents right away 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 Apparently there is a game called Break Joker that can be played on a smartphone 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 I immediately downloaded the ipad version 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 I tried 10 minutes to try it, but it's a normal blackjack card game 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.340
 Pon and I have become suddenly during the battle Well is here card Tsu make here is accustomed to 21 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340
 It is a good if 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 Only this kind of so much I coach porch of is like a Well I protest to the Te entered the turn 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.950
 I do not like it so much in the game of 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.950
 If it's just a kill, maybe it's a kill 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.980
 If I get a card from Ted if I beat it like this 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.810
 While releasing the button 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.299
 It is a game to fight 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.200
 Such a system that the card that is included here can be put in the game of the smartphone 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.420
 Isn't it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.470
 Let's get bored 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.720
 I'm pretty but I do not enter at all I do so much not interested Toka game of smartphone 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.520
 It has evolved with images now 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.000
 There is no panilla upper house or something so delicious inside . 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.619
 We will be a major gauge lesson in good faith 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.409
 What It 's bar walk I get qr code here I probably to be read here 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.619
 Therefore 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.740
 You can put this character here 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:54.009
 I wonder to what card something special guy are for candy, which I think you know is not next to it 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.810
 Menishi of good strong Toka two were 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:04.510
 It is Seto Oh Correa but Kirari was sparkling glitter 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.380
 Play complaint in Toi Saito introduced the upper house card types are as few as 15 types 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.070
 but 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.450
 It may be quite interesting to collect data cards that can be used in games 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.850
 That 's over 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.850
