suit for free this suit will give you an

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.670 
suit for free this suit will give you an
extra<00:00:16.670> 40<00:00:17.090> resistance<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.840> any<00:00:18.020> radiation

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
extra 40 resistance to any radiation

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.620 
extra 40 resistance to any radiation
that<00:00:18.830> you<00:00:18.890> receive<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.670> armor<00:00:20.060> has<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.390> best

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
that you receive the armor has the best

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.570 
that you receive the armor has the best
radiation<00:00:21.260> resistance<00:00:21.740> in<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.040> game<00:00:22.280> it

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
radiation resistance in the game it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.610 
radiation resistance in the game it
looks<00:00:22.850> pretty<00:00:23.090> cool<00:00:23.270> too<00:00:23.510> so<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:23.990> grab<00:00:24.320> it<00:00:24.500> for

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
looks pretty cool too so to grab it for

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.500 
looks pretty cool too so to grab it for
yourself<00:00:25.040> you<00:00:25.100> must<00:00:25.370> travel<00:00:25.640> here<00:00:26.000> on<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:26.300> map

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
yourself you must travel here on the map

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:37.290 
yourself you must travel here on the map
in<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.930> very<00:00:27.080> south<00:00:29.170> to<00:00:30.170> Crescent<00:00:30.500> Canyon

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.120 

it's<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:42.350> entrance<00:00:42.740> to<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.980> valley

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
it's just it the entrance to the valley

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.160 
it's just it the entrance to the valley
is<00:00:43.460> just<00:00:43.730> down<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.030> hill<00:00:44.180> ironically<00:00:44.840> you're

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
is just down the hill ironically you're

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.600 
is just down the hill ironically you're
going<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.530> have<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.829> take<00:00:46.010> some<00:00:46.220> mine<00:00:46.460> of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
going to have to take some mine of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.700 
going to have to take some mine of
radiation<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.360> get<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.690> suit<00:00:47.900> so<00:00:48.230> even<00:00:48.590> though

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
radiation to get the suit so even though

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.770 
radiation to get the suit so even though
you<00:00:48.770> don't<00:00:49.010> really<00:00:49.160> need<00:00:49.579> them<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:50.120> does<00:00:50.480> help

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
you don't really need them it does help

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.720 
you don't really need them it does help
to<00:00:50.840> bring<00:00:51.140> some<00:00:51.320> rad<00:00:51.560> X<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.190> increase<00:00:52.550> your

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
to bring some rad X to increase your

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.760 
to bring some rad X to increase your
radiation<00:00:53.360> resistance<00:00:53.870> or<00:00:54.170> at<00:00:54.410> least<00:00:54.590> some

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
radiation resistance or at least some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.920 
radiation resistance or at least some
rather<00:00:54.950> way<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.280> reduce<00:00:55.700> it<00:00:55.970> just<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.600> be<00:00:56.720> safe

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
rather way to reduce it just to be safe

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.819 
rather way to reduce it just to be safe
but<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:57.410> can<00:00:57.620> do<00:00:57.770> it<00:00:57.800> without<00:00:58.010> if<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.370> like

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.410 

and<00:01:03.829> actually<00:01:04.250> there's<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.519> secret<00:01:05.030> hollowed

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
and actually there's a secret hollowed

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.359 
and actually there's a secret hollowed
out<00:01:05.600> rock<00:01:05.960> here<00:01:06.259> if<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.799> just<00:01:06.889> look<00:01:07.159> at<00:01:07.280> this

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
out rock here if you just look at this

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.249 
out rock here if you just look at this
rock<00:01:07.670> you'll<00:01:07.939> be<00:01:08.060> able<00:01:08.179> to<00:01:08.420> search<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.020> there's

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
rock you'll be able to search it there's

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.169 
rock you'll be able to search it there's
actually<00:01:09.619> another<00:01:09.859> one<00:01:10.039> at<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.520> end<00:01:10.789> of<00:01:11.060> the

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
actually another one at the end of the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.940 
actually another one at the end of the
canyon<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:11.840> I'm<00:01:11.960> not<00:01:12.139> going<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.469> show<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:12.799> to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
canyon but I'm not going to show that to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.709 
canyon but I'm not going to show that to
you<00:01:13.009> in<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.280> video<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.880> loot<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.179> get<00:01:14.359> inside

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
you in the video the loot you get inside

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:24.539 
you in the video the loot you get inside
it<00:01:14.929> is<00:01:15.079> alright<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:15.799> not<00:01:15.950> anything<00:01:16.249> great

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.679 

now<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.609> reason<00:01:26.119> for<00:01:26.149> all<00:01:26.329> this<00:01:26.450> nuclear

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
now the reason for all this nuclear

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.779 
now the reason for all this nuclear
waste<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.439> if<00:01:27.709> you<00:01:27.889> look<00:01:28.069> up<00:01:28.249> you<00:01:28.459> can<00:01:28.609> see<00:01:28.759> a

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
waste is if you look up you can see a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.520 
waste is if you look up you can see a
truck<00:01:29.149> hanging<00:01:29.630> off<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.840> edge<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.319> canyon

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
truck hanging off the edge of the canyon

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.410 
truck hanging off the edge of the canyon
that<00:01:30.979> actually<00:01:31.369> used<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.670> be<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.819> road<00:01:32.090> there

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
that actually used to be a road there

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.090 
that actually used to be a road there
and<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.840> seems<00:01:33.109> to<00:01:33.289> have<00:01:33.380> dumped<00:01:33.709> all<00:01:33.829> this

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and it seems to have dumped all this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.249 
and it seems to have dumped all this
nuclear<00:01:34.399> waste<00:01:34.639> down<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.270> valley<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:36.049> make

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
nuclear waste down the valley just make

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.109 
nuclear waste down the valley just make
sure<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:36.590> walk<00:01:36.799> around<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.249> barrels<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:37.909> not

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
sure you walk around the barrels and not

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.269 
sure you walk around the barrels and not
over<00:01:38.509> them<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.840> your<00:01:39.170> radiation<00:01:39.590> level<00:01:40.069> won't

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:40.279 
over them and your radiation level won't

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:50.130 
over them and your radiation level won't
go<00:01:40.459> above<00:01:40.729> one<00:01:41.029> per<00:01:41.240> second

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.510 

now<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.440> actually<00:01:51.650> get<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.280> suit

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
now you can actually get the suit

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.310 
now you can actually get the suit
without<00:01:52.850> having<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.330> kill<00:01:53.570> any<00:01:53.870> enemies

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
without having to kill any enemies

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.290 
without having to kill any enemies
whatsoever<00:01:54.950> when<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.550> get<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:55.970> part

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
whatsoever when you get to this part

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.240 
whatsoever when you get to this part
make<00:01:56.659> sure<00:01:56.869> you're<00:01:57.080> going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.320> sneak<00:01:57.710> mode<00:01:57.979> and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
make sure you're going to sneak mode and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.730 
make sure you're going to sneak mode and
move<00:01:58.520> very<00:01:58.760> slowly<00:01:59.300> if<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.869> get<00:02:00.020> spotted<00:02:00.380> then

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
move very slowly if you get spotted then

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.590 
move very slowly if you get spotted then
you'll<00:02:00.890> be<00:02:01.040> attacked<00:02:01.400> by<00:02:01.610> some<00:02:01.820> geckos<00:02:02.240> though

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
you'll be attacked by some geckos though

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.660 
you'll be attacked by some geckos though
they're<00:02:02.900> easy<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.380> kill<00:02:03.619> they<00:02:04.070> can<00:02:04.310> be<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> bit

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
they're easy to kill they can be a bit
