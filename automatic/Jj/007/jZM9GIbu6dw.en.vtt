 Yiddish diesel injector cleaner 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.420
 professional product being 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:15.500
 means very pronounced 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.190
 cleaning properties apply 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.100
 professional service 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 professional service stations for 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.580
 cleaning diesel fuel systems 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.230
 engines 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.650
 additive removes by depositing injectors 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.970
 in the combustion chamber and on the pistons 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 raises the cetane number of diesel 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.469
 only provides very sure 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.510
 engine start and optimum 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.850
 spraying out the fuel accordingly 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.760
 creating high-quality air-fuel 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 mixture due to which increases due to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.410
 this increase engine power 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.090
 reduced waste toxicity 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.059
 of gases 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.039
 additive cleans the entire fuel system 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.780
 protects against corrosion improves the process 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.250
 combustion reduces exhaust emissions 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 increases the throttle response of the engine and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 recall it on the driver's actions pressed

 recommended for diesel propulsion 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.420
 mitsubishi engines 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 very diverse application of this 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 additives she can have three options 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.939
 the first option is actually disabled

 fuel feed and return wire under 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.420
 the car tank goes down inside this

 Bank engine starts on the contents 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 and working for a while is enough for 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 cleaning in order to work out 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.009
 For example, a standard view 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.040
 and work no more than half an hour second 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.100
 option this composition is additive 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.600
 used in cleaning machines 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.340
 diesel fuel systems 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.119
 professional apparatus for steel 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.670

 diesel tank 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.960
 car then these 500 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 milliliters calculated 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.479
 a maximum of 75 liters of fuel gives a very 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.479
