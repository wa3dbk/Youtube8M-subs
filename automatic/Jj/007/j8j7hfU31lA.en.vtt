cooked in our pressure cooker and we buy
this<00:00:08.099> at<00:00:08.550> our<00:00:08.880> grocery<00:00:09.690> store<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:09.990> just<00:00:10.139> take

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
this at our grocery store we just take

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.930 
this at our grocery store we just take
our<00:00:10.410> jar<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.219> don't<00:00:11.250> even<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> get

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
our jar in so we don't even have to get

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.480 
our jar in so we don't even have to get
bags<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.990> generally<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> amount<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.219> use

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
bags so generally the amount that we use

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.470 
bags so generally the amount that we use
that<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> cook<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.080> three<00:00:16.379> cups<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.480> I

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
that we like to cook is three cups and I

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.179 
that we like to cook is three cups and I
mean<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> doesn't<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.260> exactly<00:00:19.800> exact

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
mean it doesn't have to be exactly exact

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.040 
mean it doesn't have to be exactly exact
that's<00:00:23.189> pretty<00:00:23.490> close<00:00:23.730> right<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.900> this

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that's pretty close right there so this

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.050 
that's pretty close right there so this
stuff<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.500> believe<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.310> not<00:00:26.400> really<00:00:26.670> dirty

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
stuff is believe it or not really dirty

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.820 
stuff is believe it or not really dirty
when<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> needs<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> be

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
when you get it so it needs to be

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.999 
when you get it so it needs to be
cleaned<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> grains<00:00:30.449> need<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:31.019> broken

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
cleaned and the grains need to be broken

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.410 
cleaned and the grains need to be broken

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
hours and when you soak it you just soak

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.710 
hours and when you soak it you just soak
it<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.130> you're<00:02:50.820> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> soak<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.540> in

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it in you're going to soak it now in

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.210 
it in you're going to soak it now in
your<00:02:51.840> clean<00:02:52.109> filtered<00:02:52.560> water<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.070> you're

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
your clean filtered water that you're

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.080 
your clean filtered water that you're
actually<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.700> cook<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.880> what

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
actually going to cook it in and so what

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.440 
actually going to cook it in and so what
I'm<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.329> do<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.769> ratio<00:02:59.640> is<00:03:00.000> always

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
I'm going to do is the ratio is always

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
I'm going to do is the ratio is always
two<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:01.049> whenever<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.890> whenever

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
two to one whenever you have whenever

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.370 
two to one whenever you have whenever
you<00:03:02.910> cook<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.329> brown<00:03:03.630> rice<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.170> pressure

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
you cook this brown rice in a pressure

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.660 
you cook this brown rice in a pressure
cooker<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.950> if<00:03:05.040> you're<00:03:05.130> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.400> three

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
cooker so if you're going to make three

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.270 
cooker so if you're going to make three
cups<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.590> brown<00:03:07.590> rice<00:03:07.620> you're<00:03:08.100> going<00:03:08.220> to

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
cups of of brown rice you're going to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.380 
cups of of brown rice you're going to
use<00:03:08.640> six<00:03:08.940> cups<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.390> water<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.239> I've

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
use six cups of water and I think I've

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.789 
use six cups of water and I think I've
heard<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.660> different<00:03:13.139> pressure<00:03:13.319> cookers

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
heard that different pressure cookers

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.120 
heard that different pressure cookers
act<00:03:14.220> differently<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.209> everybody<00:03:15.690> has<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
act differently and so everybody has to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.059 
act differently and so everybody has to
figure<00:03:17.130> out<00:03:17.190> exactly<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:18.560> their<00:03:19.560> system<00:03:19.950> so

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
figure out exactly what their system so

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.940 
figure out exactly what their system so
there's<00:03:20.250> four<00:03:20.549> cups<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:25.410> here's<00:03:25.650> two

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
there's four cups now here's two

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.990 
there's four cups now here's two
now<00:03:27.550> Alan<00:03:28.210> is<00:03:28.330> bringing<00:03:28.720> our<00:03:29.730> dirty<00:03:30.730> rice

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
now Alan is bringing our dirty rice

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.840 
now Alan is bringing our dirty rice
water<00:03:31.330> out<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> garden<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:39.610> don't<00:03:39.730> want

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850
