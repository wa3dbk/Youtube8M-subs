00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
him fifty as you don't know it's not

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
him fifty as you don't know it's not
like<00:01:02.220> was<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:02.910> skill<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.540> just<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
like was a skill you just think about it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.499 
like was a skill you just think about it
makes<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> cry<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.130> not<00:01:05.190> alright<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
makes you cry it's not alright like that

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.540 
makes you cry it's not alright like that
but<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.050> don't<00:01:07.440> know<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.340> think<00:01:08.399> it's

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
but I don't know it's just I think it's

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.530 
but I don't know it's just I think it's
just<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.850> frustration<00:01:09.240> mainly

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.930 

looking<00:01:14.320> back<00:01:14.500> on<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:15.010> kind<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.400> stupid

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
looking back on it is kind of stupid

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.170 
looking back on it is kind of stupid
like<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.830> skill<00:01:17.830> making<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.370> upset<00:01:18.520> it's<00:01:18.970> like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
like a skill making you upset it's like

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.300 
like a skill making you upset it's like
I<00:01:19.540> don't<00:01:20.110> know<00:01:20.200> but<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:20.890> think<00:01:20.980> it's<00:01:21.250> just

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
I don't know but I think it's just

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.800 
I don't know but I think it's just
because<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.670> want<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.880> do<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:22.090> so<00:01:22.240> badly<00:01:22.510> and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
because you want to do it so badly and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.320 
because you want to do it so badly and
like<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.040> so<00:01:24.250> important<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:24.880> what<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:25.180> need

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
like it is so important to what you need

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.210 
like it is so important to what you need
to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.570> able<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.810> do<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.110> move<00:01:26.260> on<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.950> just

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
to be able to do to move on that it just

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.610 
to be able to do to move on that it just
frustrates<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.850> when<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:28.120> can't<00:01:28.360> do<00:01:28.510> it<00:01:28.690> I

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.720 

think<00:01:32.620> I<00:01:32.680> found<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:33.040> lot<00:01:33.190> harder<00:01:33.340> when<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.580> was

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
think I found a lot harder when I was

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.210 
think I found a lot harder when I was
younger<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.330> but<00:01:34.780> I<00:01:34.810> think<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.890> more

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
younger and but I think with more

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.180 
younger and but I think with more
experience<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.260> obviously<00:01:38.260> with<00:01:38.680> other<00:01:38.950> Jim

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
experience and obviously with other Jim

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.010 
experience and obviously with other Jim
that's<00:01:39.370> helped<00:01:39.640> me<00:01:39.790> out<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:40.150> that<00:01:40.450> sometimes

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
that's helped me out like that sometimes

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.490 
that's helped me out like that sometimes
I<00:01:41.290> she<00:01:41.950> say<00:01:42.130> just<00:01:42.370> start<00:01:42.820> out<00:01:42.960> white<00:01:43.960> white<00:01:44.290> guy

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
I she say just start out white white guy

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.860 
I she say just start out white white guy
so<00:01:44.560> he's<00:01:44.740> dressed<00:01:44.980> about<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.360> yeah<00:01:46.750> it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
so he's dressed about it and and yeah it

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.360 
so he's dressed about it and and yeah it
kind<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.260> made<00:01:47.410> me<00:01:47.500> realize<00:01:47.650> well<00:01:48.100> what's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
kind of just made me realize well what's

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.070 
kind of just made me realize well what's
the<00:01:48.490> point<00:01:48.610> it's<00:01:48.970> distressing<00:01:49.240> nature<00:01:49.630> words

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
the point it's distressing nature words

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.830 
the point it's distressing nature words
to<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.320> factor<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.880> forget<00:01:52.180> by<00:01:52.330> really<00:01:52.690> and

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to this factor just forget by really and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:07.150 
to this factor just forget by really and
just<00:01:52.960> move<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.230> to<00:01:53.260> next<00:01:53.440> piece

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.620 

it's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> rare<00:02:08.429> day<00:02:08.610> off<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:08.940> Becky<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.509> we're

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
it's a rare day off for Becky and we're

00:02:09.630 --> 00:03:03.330 
it's a rare day off for Becky and we're
at<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> trapper<00:02:10.140> center<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.920> her

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.350 

the<00:03:04.340> hardest<00:03:04.670> functions<00:03:05.180> probably<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.829> factor

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
the hardest functions probably a factor

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750 
the hardest functions probably a factor
it<00:03:08.360> was<00:03:08.480> quite<00:03:08.720> hard<00:03:08.959> like<00:03:09.260> now<00:03:10.220> what<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.579> did

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
it was quite hard like now what you did

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.789 
it was quite hard like now what you did
still<00:03:11.209> obviously<00:03:11.659> a<00:03:11.689> lot<00:03:11.870> more<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.140> Elise<00:03:12.470> bet

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
still obviously a lot more to Elise bet

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.390 
still obviously a lot more to Elise bet
there's<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.610> lot<00:03:13.640> everything<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.329> thought<00:03:15.400> after

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
there's a lot everything I thought after

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.630 
there's a lot everything I thought after
the<00:03:16.670> Olympic<00:03:17.209> resort<00:03:17.629> which<00:03:17.840> was<00:03:17.989> very<00:03:18.140> good

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the Olympic resort which was very good

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.890 
the Olympic resort which was very good
we<00:03:19.640> were<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:19.970> pleased<00:03:20.209> with<00:03:20.480> that

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
we were so pleased with that

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.979 
we were so pleased with that
it<00:03:21.590> was<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.980> was<00:03:22.099> hard<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.519> then<00:03:22.849> get<00:03:23.450> moving

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
it was it was hard to then get moving

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.440 
it was it was hard to then get moving
again<00:03:24.079> I<00:03:24.590> think<00:03:25.069> that<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.579> pressure<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:26.209> built

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
again I think that the pressure is built

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.929 
again I think that the pressure is built
up<00:03:26.659> for<00:03:27.019> Becky<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.920> last<00:03:28.159> couple<00:03:28.459> years<00:03:28.519> more

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
up for Becky the last couple years more

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.690 
up for Becky the last couple years more
so<00:03:28.970> than<00:03:29.329> ever<00:03:29.569> and<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.680> kind<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.370> tell<00:03:31.519> them

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.580 
so than ever and so I kind of tell them
