00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.540
 but then you have already confirmed the 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.700
 team for Sunday 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.530
 more or less before they always discover the 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.090
 team you have to see some young people that 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.279
 are with some fatigue but in 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.150
 principle is the team that have already given 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:32.960
 by accumulated it surely goes with one out 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:39.520
 in leandro in Mariano the tasting and indicated 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.940
 johnny 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 your idea is obviously in the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.140
 South American tournament try to rotate 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 as little as possible to shorten distances 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 to the pointer and to stay alive in the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.720
 South American let's match after match 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.700
 and see how they are 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.820
 the idea is always to try to make two or 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.470
 three rotations there are moments that I can 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.560
 do not do any the time that I can 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.890
 do more of those rotations I've always 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.750
 I need all said and if it comes 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.290
 a split streak and always follow 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.630
 playing the same thing I would be lying 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.460
 at one point you marked that you had to 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.670
 work a lot from the mood with this 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.550
 group having already gone through three matches 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.110
 good results that is what you have 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.630
 to work now out of the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.480
 psychic and at what point are you good 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.540
 get that ideal equipment 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.580
 we know which where we are not being 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.350
 so effective what can be our 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.940
 flaws and we work them open them 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.990
 then the mental maybe is not the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.300
 team that we assume the victory gives you 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.030
 trust but at the same time we know 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.190
 chatted that you have to have memory there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.780
 to confirm match after match the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.780
 compliments are very nice but many times 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 they do more harm than criticisms and in that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.890
 sense I think the guys are fine 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.450
 it tries to expose us what 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.050
 less possible to be careful with the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.110
 declarations 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.390
 that's what sports and sports 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.000
 we know we have failures and we try to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.260
 improve them during the week now you go 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.940
 speaking a little bit more what football 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 mouth needs to win yes or yes to not 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.470
 stay away from the tip and suddenly 4 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.780
 you care how it is to continue playing 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.490
 with this intensity that they are doing 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.540
 look forward to you always have to 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.209
 try to always win in the obligation 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 the theme of the championship later when 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.099
 finish we will see 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.900
 if we were close but if we could but 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.640
 we have to worry about 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.940
 we 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640
 the result is the most important 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.490
 I'm interested in reaching that result 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.630
 in a way and if it's the way that 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.400
 you work a lot better I think that 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.650
 any coach when he sees shaped 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.150
 his work within the field feels a 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.900
 certification 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.450
 but well this is easy to say we have 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.970
 to be able to demonstrate it on the court and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.010
 in front of us we have a wounded team a 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.170
 big team with good players with 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.000
 a technician who has ideas well 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.150
 clear and we have to have a lot 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.150
 watch out
