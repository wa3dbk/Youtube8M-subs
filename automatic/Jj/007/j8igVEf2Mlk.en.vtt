00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 let's talk now then of 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.240
 photographic composition 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.800
 direction and movement 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.900
 If there is something that moves, it must have a 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.670
 direction and a space to move 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.070
 here you see in the example of this panning 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.560
 sweep that is the technique that allows 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.570
 keep an object moving and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.970
 good and that the rest can appear like this 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.919
 everything as a sweep as the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.200
 word on one hand the lines 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.470
 diagonals of the same sweep panning 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.930
 accentuate the feeling of movement 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.360
 besides the motorcycle is moving and 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.920
 has a space ahead where 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.920
 move where you can move 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.960
 and our brain then accepts that the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.780
 motorcycle is going to move to that space 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 if we cut the photograph as here by 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.910
 example we do not have that feeling but 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.820
 on the contrary the photo hits us with 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.339
 positively the motorcycle leaves the photo 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 let's say if we want that if we want 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.340
 make a later approach if we 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.490
 we see how this one is much more 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 convenient more effective this framing 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 where if there is a space for the motorcycle 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.710
 move not in addition this approach you 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.710
 gives more impact to photography 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.159
 here the same thing happens the girl is 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.540
 jumping in the air and has a space 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.450
 ahead where to move where to advance 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.700
 these photographs in the lagoon of 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 sandy area in costa rica 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.860
 the same thing happens with the objects that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.670
 they move 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.930
 happens with the line of the glance applies 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.940
 the same when someone is looking 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.460
 something our brain automatically 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.070
 follow the look and look for that object 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.400
 looked at the picture happens 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.310
 exactly the same thing so there's that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.369
 leave a space that look so that the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.080
 take more harmonic here we see that for 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.330
 the side where felipe is looking at 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 dog 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.910
 there is enough space not what the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.760
 dog can appear in the frame or not 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.430
 if it does not appear as this case gives us 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 Certain mystery does not intrigue us to know what 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 is what you are seeing 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.150
 to the same thing if we cut the photo we do not give 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 that space here in the photo on the right 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.099
 we do not give that space to the gaze of the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.349
 dog there is no image the image looks 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.510
 rare and not so harmonious that the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.920
 we can compare with this one if it has 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.920
 a space where the mile 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.100
 and the same thing happens with the picture of this 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.800
 girl in guatemala 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.350
 the air in front of the gaze creates a 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.110
 much more real composition or our 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.000
 brain understands the photo better 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.360
 is the mystery more for the expression of 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.210
 the girl what is she going to see 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:12.000
 why are you seeing it like that then 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:16.260
 it is very simple this rule to learn 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.670
 taking pictures is the way in which 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.670
 you are going to advance better
