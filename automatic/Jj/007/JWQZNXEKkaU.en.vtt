the literature as far as I can tell it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
the literature as far as I can tell it
was<00:01:22.830> first<00:01:23.100> discussed<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> 1950s<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
was first discussed in the 1950s and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.060 
was first discussed in the 1950s and
that<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.780> object

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
that is that when you have an object

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.380 
that is that when you have an object
spinning<00:01:29.070> rapidly<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.000> generally

good<00:01:35.700> news<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.710> 2,000<00:01:37.710> rpm<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
good news is is that at 2,000 rpm the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.789 
good news is is that at 2,000 rpm the
effect<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.450> about<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.990> factor<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> 10

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
effect is big it's about a factor of 10

effect is big it's about a factor of 10
now<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.329> predicated<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> notion

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now all this is predicated on the notion

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
now all this is predicated on the notion
that<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.009> somehow<00:01:44.250> relay<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.060> heat<00:01:45.270> from

long<00:02:12.560> off<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.180> simple<00:02:14.210> when<00:02:14.840> we

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930

quickly within a couple seconds you'll

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.770 
quickly within a couple seconds you'll

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
see that you'll hear this thing lift off

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.040 
see that you'll hear this thing lift off
and<00:02:21.170> separate<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.610> becomes

and separate and it becomes

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.690 
and separate and it becomes
self-supporting<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.650> that's<00:02:25.430> called<00:02:25.580> a

hydrodynamic air bearing and it's very

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.790 
hydrodynamic air bearing and it's very

so<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.490> thing<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:40.940> coasting<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.840> then

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
so that the thing is coasting and then

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.199 
so that the thing is coasting and then
you'll<00:03:42.800> be<00:03:42.920> able<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.190> hear<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.730> what<00:03:44.000> the

you'll be able to hear just what the

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
air sounds like on its own okay so I'm

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.890 
air sounds like on its own okay so I'm
doing<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:49.910> right<00:03:49.970> now
