00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.649
 hello friends and youtube friends 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.299
 welcome once again to one of my 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.580
 videos in today's video I want you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.860
 show how to get a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 off screen with the crt effect 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.059
 which is the effect that makes our 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 smartphone goes off like a television 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.949
 old and that is through a double 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.949
 pulsation to get this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.820
 if you want to achieve this in your 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.820
 smartphone follow the next steps 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.140
 we turn on the smartphone 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.890
 I do it using the launcher nava 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.840
 launcher in its prime version 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.110
 because the prime version allows us 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.059
 access gestures and buttons and some 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.579
 concrete gestures then add some 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.400
 actions determined this as has been 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.140
 said in its prime version 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.410
 then we should go to double tap 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.960
 in the shortcuts and the option that 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.720
 we want to add only we will appear if 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.909
 we have installed the tap because the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.880
 option is to hibernate more block screen 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.430
 everything together this option offers us the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 tap is to say we need to have 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.030
 installed the new launcher in its 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.270
 prime version that I made a video 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.040
 previous where I put the link for 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.560
 download this launcher in its version 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.000
 prime and then another video in which 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.250
 Granny fi also appeared to us 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.880
 you also have in the download link 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.410
 in said video therefore if you have 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.149
 followed my videos if you have the new 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.430
 launcher in its prime version and you have the 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.170
 great purpose installed because the only thing that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.880
 you must do is the following as I have 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.300
 explained entering the new launcher 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.090
 enter gestures 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.730
 in double click add in accesses 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.010
 direct the option of that and see me more 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.810
 block the screen by doing double 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.729
 pulsation 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 and we would have already selected what is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.580
 the screen off with the double 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 pulsation 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.330
 and now if we want to add that off 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 screen has the crt effect 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.450
 we need the root user to have 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.880
 installed the exhibitor install 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.810
 and in after installing 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.180
 I the screen shutdown cr type what 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 I have done by applying 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.859
 screen of animation can also be 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.620
 perform through the gravity box that 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:29.140
 they have the option of crt but I do not 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.109
 it worked with that with this granitic 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.500
 with this pk therefore I have had to 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:38.280
 look for another different module 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.200
 that will give me the same option and what 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 achieved with the screen of animation the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.180
 screen of animation once you have it 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.990
 added this module and activated like that 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.730
 allows us to add the screen option or 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.400
 the screen shutdown 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.200
 certain animations that 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.299
 we have selected the horizontal crt 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 what is this type of screen shutdown 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.020
 old television we have lists 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.510
 previous of all the off 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.560
 and also if you want you there too 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.560
 also some 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.269
 screen ons is to say when 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 we turn on the screen that also has 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.040
 a certain effect although there is less 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.380
 options and we do not have the effect of 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.110
 old television 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.570
 Well, as I was saying with this one with this 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.440
 module we will get that the shutdown of 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.590
 screen has the cereté effect 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.890
 therefore everything together 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.050
 we would get this double pulse 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.130
 català screen with cereté effect 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.130
 we have the screen 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.520
 and that's all that I wanted to show 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.709
 today the video was to show you the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.569
 way to get the shutdown of 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.630
 screen with cereté effect but on 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.600
 everything together with the double pulse if it has 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.700
 liked the video give it a good like 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.920
