00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the bromeliads are showing a little bit

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.480 
the bromeliads are showing a little bit
of<00:00:17.990> mush<00:00:18.990> almost<00:00:19.470> because<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:19.949> got<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> little

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
of mush almost because they got a little

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.990 
of mush almost because they got a little
too<00:00:20.789> wet<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.410> there's<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.619> neuro<00:00:23.400> geoya<00:00:23.760> in

too wet so there's one neuro geoya in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.340 
too wet so there's one neuro geoya in
the<00:00:24.119> front<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.480> want<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> show<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.990> because

the front I want to show you because

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.009 
the front I want to show you because
what<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:26.460> cut<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
what you can do is actually cut out the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500 
what you can do is actually cut out the
whole<00:00:28.260> dead<00:00:28.680> part<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> plant<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.480> plant

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
whole dead part of the plant the plant

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.100 
whole dead part of the plant the plant
puts<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.439> pups<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.750> taking

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
puts out pups so I'm going to be taking

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
puts out pups so I'm going to be taking
out<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.469> couple<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.550> pups<00:00:35.910> because

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
out a couple of the other pups because

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.020 
out a couple of the other pups because
they<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:38.160> need<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.790> right

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
they they really need it and it's right

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.639 
they they really need it and it's right
in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> front<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.960> I'll<00:00:40.110> probably<00:00:40.290> do

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
in the front and what I'll probably do

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.920 
in the front and what I'll probably do
is<00:00:40.680> move<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> front

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
is move this one that's in the front

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.350 
is move this one that's in the front
towards<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:44.010> somewhere<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
towards the back somewhere and that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.260 
towards the back somewhere and that
means<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.260> another<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.489> brand<00:00:48.059> new

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
means I can get another one a brand new

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
means I can get another one a brand new
one<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> go<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.750> front<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.270> I'm

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
one to go up front here and I think I'm

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
one to go up front here and I think I'm
going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> use<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.140> tool<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> tool<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
going to use this tool this is a tool I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.529 
going to use this tool this is a tool I
got<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> Japanese<00:00:55.129> hardware<00:00:56.129> store<00:00:56.539> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
got at a Japanese hardware store in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.680 
got at a Japanese hardware store in
Japan<00:00:58.140> town<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.920> San<00:00:59.100> Francisco<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.510> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
Japan town in San Francisco and I use it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
Japan town in San Francisco and I use it
for<00:01:00.899> phormium<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.949> cutting<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> New<00:01:03.149> Zealand

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
for phormium for cutting the New Zealand

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870 
for phormium for cutting the New Zealand
blacks<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.409> their<00:01:04.799> leaves<00:01:05.519> were<00:01:05.670> very

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
blacks because their leaves were very

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
blacks because their leaves were very
hard<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> cut<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> tool<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
hard to cut but I think this tool is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
hard to cut but I think this tool is
going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> work<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
going to work really well on this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
going to work really well on this
project<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.310> should<00:01:11.460> check<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.760> some

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
project and you should check out some

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
project and you should check out some
Japanese<00:01:12.810> tools<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> garden<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> get

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
Japanese tools for the garden if you get

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
Japanese tools for the garden if you get
a<00:01:14.100> chance<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.549> they're<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.119> great

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
a chance because they're really great

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:45.370 
a chance because they're really great
they<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.689> some<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.070> interesting<00:01:17.070> tools

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.540 

so<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.370> to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.630 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
let<00:01:47.730> those<00:01:48.000> stems<00:01:48.500> actually<00:01:49.500> die<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
let those stems actually die out and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.000 
let those stems actually die out and
I'll<00:01:50.790> pull<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.420> I'll<00:01:51.750> cut<00:01:52.200> them<00:01:52.410> down<00:01:52.620> a

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
I'll pull them out I'll cut them down a

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.430 
I'll pull them out I'll cut them down a
bit<00:01:53.430> further<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.510> plant<00:01:54.750> looks<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.200> little

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
bit further and the plant looks a little

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.810 
bit further and the plant looks a little
bit<00:01:55.680> awkward<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:57.050> but<00:01:58.050> new<00:01:58.290> pups<00:01:58.619> will<00:01:58.979> appear

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
bit awkward now but new pups will appear

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
bit awkward now but new pups will appear
because<00:01:59.940> they<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> newest<00:02:01.320> one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
because they do this is the newest one

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.330 
because they do this is the newest one
here<00:02:02.010> so<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.940> I<00:02:03.630> said<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.930> might<00:02:04.440> even<00:02:04.590> divide<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
here so as I said I might even divide it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
here so as I said I might even divide it
I<00:02:05.430> might<00:02:05.790> divide<00:02:06.150> these<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.200> off<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.830> put

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I might divide these two off and put

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.280 
I might divide these two off and put
them<00:02:08.520> together<00:02:08.729> into<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.080> make

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
them together into one and then make

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.430 
them together into one and then make
this<00:02:10.830> into<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.670> put<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> toward<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> back

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this into one and put it toward the back

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
this into one and put it toward the back
of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.740> garden<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> passion<00:02:15.390> for

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
of the garden I have a passion for

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.930 
of the garden I have a passion for
succulents<00:02:16.380> because<00:02:16.620> you've<00:02:16.800> seen<00:02:17.100> quite<00:02:17.880> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
succulents because you've seen quite a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
succulents because you've seen quite a
few<00:02:18.060> succulents<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.870> my<00:02:19.050> front<00:02:19.320> yard<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:19.770> I've
