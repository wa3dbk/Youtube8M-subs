00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like such a miniscule amount of room

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.020 
like such a miniscule amount of room
it's<00:01:29.010> just<00:01:29.070> melting<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.610> under<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.850> rocks

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's just melting one under the rocks

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's just melting one under the rocks
but<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.690> just<00:01:33.870> put<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
but you know just put that in there so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.140 
but you know just put that in there so
the<00:01:34.980> bacteria<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.580> some<00:01:35.730> pneumonia<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the bacteria will have some pneumonia to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
the bacteria will have some pneumonia to
feed<00:01:36.330> off<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:40.200> um<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:43.620> water

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
feed off of and and the um and the water

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.980 
feed off of and and the um and the water
conditioner<00:01:44.370> and<00:01:44.460> such<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.840> has<00:01:45.930> been

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
conditioner and such so this has been

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
conditioner and such so this has been
cycling<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.410> about<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.680> week<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:47.130> want<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.550> put

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

cycling for about a week I want to put
them<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.120> now<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.320> only<00:01:49.680> concern<00:01:50.930> would

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
them in here now the only concern would

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
them in here now the only concern would
be<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> heat<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> heater<00:01:53.520> right

be the heat but I have a heater right

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100 
be the heat but I have a heater right
there<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.060> move<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.660> in<00:01:54.780> here

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
there I can move that right in here

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.740 
there I can move that right in here
heat<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> tank<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.330> they<00:01:57.330> can<00:01:57.480> be<00:01:57.510> ready

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
heat this tank up and they can be ready

my other concern with putting them in a
big<00:02:03.270> tank<00:02:03.390> would<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.690> if<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.840> had<00:02:03.960> more<00:02:04.110> fish

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
big tank would be if I had more fish

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.130 
big tank would be if I had more fish
this<00:02:04.710> fish<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.310> fish<00:02:05.670> tank<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> bare<00:02:06.420> nothing

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.000 
this fish this fish tank is bare nothing
to<00:02:07.200> worry<00:02:07.410> about<00:02:07.470> number<00:02:08.399> three<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.240> filter

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
to worry about number three the filter

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
to worry about number three the filter
so<00:02:14.490> because<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.730> filter<00:02:16.150> could<00:02:16.780> suck<00:02:17.020> up<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
so because the filter could suck up the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.870 
so because the filter could suck up the
small<00:02:17.440> babies<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.510> decided<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.990> ring<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
filters that way the water can still

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.470 
filters that way the water can still
come<00:02:29.500> through<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:30.550> water<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.940> be<00:02:31.030> cycled

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
come through the water can be cycled

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.290 
come through the water can be cycled
because<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:31.900> much<00:02:32.050> waste<00:02:32.290> right<00:02:32.530> now

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
like my whole you know cheap design of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.320 
like my whole you know cheap design of
doing<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.920> because<00:03:20.920> it's<00:03:21.850> for<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.120> sake<00:03:22.300> of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
doing it because it's for the sake of

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.750 
doing it because it's for the sake of
being<00:03:22.540> cheap<00:03:22.870> then<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.280> might<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.490> keep<00:03:24.640> it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
being cheap then it might so keep it

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.860 
being cheap then it might so keep it
common<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> yourself<00:03:25.360> cuz<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.540> really<00:03:25.630> don't
