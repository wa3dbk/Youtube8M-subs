video about the pioneer CDJ 800 effect
part<00:00:07.799> 2<00:00:08.040> about<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.090> make<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.420> kind<00:00:09.540> of

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
part 2 about how to make that kind of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.140 
part 2 about how to make that kind of
cool<00:00:09.809> sound<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.380> since<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.400> did<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.700> for<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
cool sound and since you did one for the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.520 
cool sound and since you did one for the
800<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> thought<00:00:12.750> I'd<00:00:12.870> show<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.080> how<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.410> it

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
800 I thought I'd show you how to do it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.860 
800 I thought I'd show you how to do it
on<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> Stanton<00:00:14.070> see<00:00:14.280> point<00:00:14.549> 314<00:00:15.299> essentially

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
on the Stanton see point 314 essentially

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.689 
on the Stanton see point 314 essentially
it's<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> same<00:00:16.350> there's<00:00:17.279> not<00:00:17.400> really<00:00:17.550> any

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it's the same there's not really any

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.950 
it's the same there's not really any
difference<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.210> also<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> demonstrate

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
difference but also want to demonstrate

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.179 
difference but also want to demonstrate
that<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.710> done<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.010> particular

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
that it can be done on this particular

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
that it can be done on this particular
deck<00:00:20.580> now<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.570> aren't<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.470> cool

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
deck now there aren't the kind of cool

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.439 
deck now there aren't the kind of cool
buttons<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> 800<00:00:23.730> has<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
buttons that the 800 has for like the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

your loop in and out and your redo
buttons<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> guy<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.059> he<00:00:33.059> has<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
buttons on this guy and he has some of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.549 
buttons on this guy and he has some of
the<00:00:33.480> features<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the features I don't know if the if you

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
the features I don't know if the if you
have<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:34.950> or<00:00:35.040> less<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.430> whatever<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
have more or less or whatever but I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
have more or less or whatever but I
think<00:00:36.270> there's<00:00:36.600> probably<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.930> few<00:00:37.110> different

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
think there's probably a few different

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
think there's probably a few different
features<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.129> 800<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.180> few

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
features on this from this 800 and a few

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.990 
features on this from this 800 and a few
that<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> missing<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.410> header<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
that this is missing from the header and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.459 
that this is missing from the header and
overall<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> 800<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.809> definitely<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> better

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
overall the 800 is definitely the better

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
overall the 800 is definitely the better
deck<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
deck but this is what I got and I that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.869 
deck but this is what I got and I that
demonstrate<00:00:46.320> um<00:00:46.530> let's<00:00:47.340> start<00:00:47.520> by<00:00:47.640> playing

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
demonstrate um let's start by playing

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.290 
demonstrate um let's start by playing
the<00:00:48.000> song<00:00:50.870> just<00:00:51.870> hit<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.890> real<00:00:53.100> quick

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
the song just hit in and out real quick

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.170 
the song just hit in and out real quick
hold<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.780> button<00:00:55.969> till<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> get

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
hold down the out button till you get

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.650 
hold down the out button till you get
that<00:00:57.809> display<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> matter<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that display and it is just a matter of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.810 
that display and it is just a matter of
turning<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.370> jog<00:01:02.370> wheel

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
turning the jog wheel

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.899 
turning the jog wheel
until<00:01:04.390> you<00:01:04.480> get<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> sound<00:01:05.340> be<00:01:06.340> out<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:06.760> you're

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
until you get the sound be out so you're

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.399 
until you get the sound be out so you're
in<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.090> mode

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
in that mode

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.499 
in that mode
I've<00:01:08.979> already<00:01:09.130> got<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> pitch<00:01:09.670> adjusted<00:01:10.390> to

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
I've already got the pitch adjusted to

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.560 
I've already got the pitch adjusted to
100%<00:01:11.939> she<00:01:12.939> can<00:01:13.090> see<00:01:13.240> what<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.509> does

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
100% she can see what that does

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.790 

you

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.010 

so<00:01:19.400> there<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.580> go

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
so there you go

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.740 
so there you go
essentially<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:21.979> same<00:01:22.159> thing<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:23.509> something

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
essentially the same thing and something

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.209 
essentially the same thing and something
that<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.049> was<00:01:24.200> kind<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.409> fun<00:01:24.619> too<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.100> if

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
that that was kind of fun too is if

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.300 
that that was kind of fun too is if
you'd<00:01:25.340> put<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.759> flanger<00:01:26.179> on<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.679> you<00:01:27.679> can<00:01:27.799> can

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
you'd put the flanger on it you can can

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.820 
you'd put the flanger on it you can can
get<00:01:28.460> some<00:01:28.609> full<00:01:28.820> effects<00:01:29.149> that<00:01:29.360> way

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.860 

and<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.550> putting<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.940> transform<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
and I like putting the transform on it

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:56.380 
and I like putting the transform on it
as<00:01:36.960> well<00:01:44.810> started<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:45.960> dead<00:01:46.320> stop

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.670 

and<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.660> just<00:01:57.690> completely<00:01:58.050> goofing

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and this is just completely goofing

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
and this is just completely goofing
around<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.010> it<00:01:59.220> but<00:01:59.870> I'm<00:02:00.870> not<00:02:01.050> sure<00:02:01.110> there's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
around with it but I'm not sure there's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.470 
around with it but I'm not sure there's
really<00:02:01.470> any<00:02:01.680> real-world<00:02:02.300> application<00:02:03.300> for

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
really any real-world application for

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.390 
really any real-world application for
that<00:02:03.510> but<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.230> fun<00:02:04.410> here's<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.280> with

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
that but it's kind of fun here's it with

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.140 
that but it's kind of fun here's it with
the<00:02:05.490> filter<00:02:13.370> back<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> same<00:02:14.850> mode<00:02:15.030> again

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the filter back to the same mode again

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.700 
the filter back to the same mode again
let's<00:02:15.360> crank<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:15.960> somebody<00:02:16.500> want<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
let's crank it up here somebody want to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.350 
let's crank it up here somebody want to
know<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.040> sounded<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.280> with<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.880> with

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
know what it sounded like with the with

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440 
know what it sounded like with the with
it<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.570> reverse<00:02:19.850> almost<00:02:20.850> exactly<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.390> same

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it on reverse almost exactly the same

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.630 
it on reverse almost exactly the same
built<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.380> sample<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.830> taking<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.370> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
built that the sample is taking is so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.700 
built that the sample is taking is so
small<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:25.200> doesn't<00:02:25.350> make<00:02:25.530> any

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
small that really doesn't make any

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.990 
small that really doesn't make any
difference<00:02:25.890> whether<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.490> forward<00:02:26.910> or

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
difference whether it's going forward or

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.710 
difference whether it's going forward or
reverse<00:02:27.060> even<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> slow<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.080> down<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
reverse even if you slow it down the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.990 
reverse even if you slow it down the
sound<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.350> tiny<00:02:31.620> bit<00:02:31.800> different<00:02:35.000> let's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
sound is just a tiny bit different let's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.380 
sound is just a tiny bit different let's
reverse<00:02:36.980> that's<00:02:37.980> forward

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.050 

anyway<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:42.370> what<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.520> sounds<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:43.819> on

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
anyway that's what that sounds like on

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.920 
anyway that's what that sounds like on
see<00:02:44.300> point<00:02:44.720> 314<00:02:45.319> I<00:02:46.540> wouldn't<00:02:47.540> try<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.690> do<00:02:47.840> it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
see point 314 I wouldn't try to do it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.199 
see point 314 I wouldn't try to do it
with<00:02:48.040> mp3<00:02:49.040> discs<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.850> doesn't<00:02:50.150> seem

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
with mp3 discs on this this doesn't seem

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.059 
with mp3 discs on this this doesn't seem
that<00:02:50.270> this<00:02:50.870> particular<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.530> deck<00:02:51.890> doesn't

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
that this particular that deck doesn't

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.820 
that this particular that deck doesn't
seem<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> be<00:02:52.459> quite<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.730> stable<00:02:53.030> with<00:02:53.500> mp3<00:02:54.500> discs

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
seem to be quite a stable with mp3 discs

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.830 
seem to be quite a stable with mp3 discs
it's<00:02:55.280> intends<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.940> be<00:02:56.030> more<00:02:56.240> stable<00:02:56.450> with<00:02:56.690> just

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
it's intends to be more stable with just

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.190 
it's intends to be more stable with just
regular<00:02:56.930> audio<00:02:57.410> CDs<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.790> anyway<00:02:59.720> this<00:03:00.140> a
