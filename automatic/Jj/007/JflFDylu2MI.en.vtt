little<00:01:24.680> hard<00:01:24.829> to<00:01:24.920> come<00:01:25.070> by<00:01:25.220> but<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.000> deal

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
little hard to come by but we can deal

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.300 
little hard to come by but we can deal
with<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:27.530> are<00:01:27.650> really<00:01:27.890> accurate

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
with that and that are really accurate

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.859 
with that and that are really accurate
rifles<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.880> most<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.479> time<00:01:29.630> they're<00:01:29.810> in

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
rifles and most of the time they're in

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.359 
rifles and most of the time they're in
really<00:01:30.020> good<00:01:30.200> condition<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:31.070> think<00:01:31.250> this

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
really good condition and I think this

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.210 
really good condition and I think this
makes<00:01:31.610> for<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.939> really<00:01:32.270> excellent<00:01:32.750> subject<00:01:33.649> or

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
makes for a really excellent subject or

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.190 
makes for a really excellent subject or
or<00:01:34.549> focal<00:01:35.030> point<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.509> collection<00:01:35.990> for

you what to look for and what the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.039 
you what to look for and what the
