00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 I know that a little bit now 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.969
 I already know that from the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.789
 xbox 360 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.800
 yes, there is not wrong is fixed 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.590
 There was already a year ago for the xbox 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.830
 now it goes but also the pc version yes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.750
 Diana has also tested herself 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.920
 But time is what developers like 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 I think it was worth the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.760
 wait because that's really easy 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.260
 an idyllic game so I could there 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.200
 really easy to watch for hours 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.329
 but only behind it is gameplay 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.460
 really what you like right here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 looks at the first impression is this 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.690
 plate 2d gameplay but you can do that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.850
 turn perspective in 90 degrees increments 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.970
 and that really makes the game stop 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.620
 very interesting because by the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.180
 perspective changing changing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 distances you can over abysses 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.590
 jump those were too big and before 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.200
 this will be the game very well this 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.180
 feature great it looks so first 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.250
 really unfamiliar endurance that long 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 view to get used to it or get one 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.579
 Being on a good man is really 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.009
 very fast in the game and you can 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.650
 pursue the game goal is what is 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.330
 collect dice and yes more is there too 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.790
 not because the game has a story 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.570
 but that is really very much now 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.479
 minimalist there are no opponents 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.700
 you are really just more customers from 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.930
 fit these levels and just try 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.260
 to collect these dice 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.380
 that means there are no opponents either 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.680
 fight in the sense that's right at all 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.659
 Not 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.159
 you can die but that's one 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 really the one thing you have 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.479
 fairer check points is the focus 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 really exploring these levels 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.890
 discover new secrets and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.869
 find solutions for problems and is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.369
 this is a linear game because you say 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.799
 now secretions or can I do that 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.400
 criss- cross the game world 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.900
 march 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.820
 it is actually quite messy 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.400
 as you can see it has beautiful 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.619
 play a kind of tree structure and the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.810
 Levels have many many different ones 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.130
 Paths that can be branched off from one another 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.470
 that feels a bit like it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.530
 but also that one of the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.209
 Criticisms of the game who, however, on 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.379
 easy things to explore and 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.670
 Not too taken by hand 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.040
 Just go to what 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.090
 There's a lot to see for yourself 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.739
 Have fun with this overview now 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.569
 just did not see that hall 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.250
 after how little play time 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.900
 effectively, I get there 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.630
 the levels are actually 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.069
 it would be pretty small because of that 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.290
 investment is loose after four hours 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.840
 but there are lots of things 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.510
 secrets which even others are cube 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.610
 but okay and who wants to collect them all 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.360
 That's up to eight hours 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.360
 employed 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 You've already mentioned that it's a mystery 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.959
 gives the game how do you see it? 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.069
 usually out because it is so 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.260
 first off like a jump'n'run 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.269
 actually the intrusion so far 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.060
 Actually, it is like a puzzle game and 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.560
 that also has such a secret language 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.299
 actually you have to decipher first 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.840
 and there are very many based on that 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.970
 mystery 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.220
 that's pretty cool at first because of it 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.959
 you really discover what, though 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.239
 In the course of the game , it will be me 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.030
 but a little too much 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.359
 puzzling this code there would have been a bit 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.370
 more variety did not hurt 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.549
 but it is so he is so in the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.590
 pearl in any case so it has this 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.109
 look this in this much of the in 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.799
 the, game also has beautiful this 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.870
 soundtrack that would be the ones on this 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.370
 retro feeling is the has a lot 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.260
 fun with but you have to deal with it 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.629
 accept that similar tempo very much 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.030
 it is slow from the game you have to 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.440
 slowly everything is exploring no real 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.810
 challenges but has the senses 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.810
 only this one looks but that one fun
