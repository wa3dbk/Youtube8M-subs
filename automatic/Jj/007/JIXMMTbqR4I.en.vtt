00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.630 
to the manoeuvrability you could be an
extremely<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.360> placed<00:01:25.159> athletic<00:01:26.159> machine

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
extremely well placed athletic machine

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.300 
extremely well placed athletic machine
so<00:01:27.570> again<00:01:27.930> maneuverability<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.860> probably<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so again maneuverability is probably the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.620 
so again maneuverability is probably the
most<00:01:29.460> important<00:01:29.909> part<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> game<00:01:30.360> it's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
most important part of the game it's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.819 
most important part of the game it's
probably<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> hardest<00:01:30.990> learning<00:01:31.680> curve

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
probably the hardest learning curve

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.910 
probably the hardest learning curve
about<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.850> game<00:01:33.030> -<00:01:33.290> inside<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> also

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
about the game - inside of that it also

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
about the game - inside of that it also
kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.689> alters<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.229> melee

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
kind of alters you have your melee

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
kind of alters you have your melee
ability<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.549> your<00:01:38.820> secondary<00:01:39.299> in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
ability you have your your secondary in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
ability you have your your secondary in
your<00:01:39.659> primary<00:01:40.110> weapon<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.100> sniper

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
your primary weapon I have a the sniper

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
your primary weapon I have a the sniper
available<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.180> submachine<00:01:42.659> gun

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
available I have a submachine gun

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
available I have a submachine gun
secondary<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> sword<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.460> my

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.389 
secondary and I have a sword as my
primary<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.689> again<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> balance<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
primary so again you have to balance it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
primary so again you have to balance it
out<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> take<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.149> dashes<00:01:48.689> your<00:01:48.840> wall

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
out so if you take your dashes your wall

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.149 
out so if you take your dashes your wall
running<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> everything<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.950> you

running and everything like that you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.590 
running and everything like that you
maneuver<00:01:50.670> around<00:01:50.880> you're<00:01:51.030> getting<00:01:51.240> close<00:01:51.420> for

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
maneuver around you're getting close for

this thing has very very very little
requirements<00:02:21.800> even<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.460> recommended

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
requirements even the recommended

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.640 
requirements even the recommended
requirements<00:02:23.660> are<00:02:23.720> probably<00:02:24.080> lower<00:02:24.350> grade

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
requirements are probably lower grade

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.470 
requirements are probably lower grade
than<00:02:24.680> what<00:02:25.070> you're<00:02:25.580> running<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:26.390> your

than what you're running in just your
average<00:02:26.660> home<00:02:27.050> PC<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.490> it's<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.790> really<00:02:29.000> really

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320
