 version may have arrived and as you can see 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.940
 If I read in team properties, they will 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.530
 see that your windows 7 home basic can 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.350

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.800
 7 home basic good 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 if they want also to see how 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.170

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.370
 works the transparent let's say 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.520
 As you can see, the preview works 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.250
 Everything that would be in the program works 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.480
 we go 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.560
 well I'm going to leave at this time 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.910

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.910
 Yes now 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.849

 desk if they want is true but not 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.260

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.260
 I think here had some image 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.330
 good can you add pictures can 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.190
 to change by changing a bit 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.530
 what would be 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.210
 it's not true let's say with the option already 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.190
 they already have what would be enabled 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.530
