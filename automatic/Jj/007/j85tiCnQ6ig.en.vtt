you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.140> forward<00:01:35.130> X<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.229> know

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you can forward X now if you don't know

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
you can forward X now if you don't know
what<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.650> its<00:01:37.950> forward<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.670> diagonal

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
what that is its forward down diagonal

what that is its forward down diagonal
forward<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:39.869> diagonal<00:01:40.409> x<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:43.130> would

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
forward down diagonal x I would

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
forward down diagonal x I would
recommend<00:01:44.430> changing<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.530> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
recommend changing that because it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.100 
recommend changing that because it's
kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> easy<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> mix<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.049> fuck<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.320> lot

kind of easy to mix up and fuck up a lot

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.310

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
interesting to note about this move is

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.899 
interesting to note about this move is
that<00:02:41.349> after<00:02:41.709> you've<00:02:42.040> hit<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.280> opponent<00:02:42.609> with

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
that after you've hit the opponent with

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
this they gain a status effect of

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.119 
this they gain a status effect of
burning<00:02:46.180> they<00:02:46.569> basically<00:02:46.810> take<00:02:47.409> damage<00:02:47.739> over

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
burning they basically take damage over

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.309 
burning they basically take damage over
time<00:02:48.159> even<00:02:48.640> after<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.239> moves<00:02:49.450> been<00:02:49.690> used<00:02:50.049> and

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
time even after the moves been used and

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.440 
time even after the moves been used and
as<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.370> see<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.609> does<00:02:51.760> pretty<00:02:52.000> decent

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
as you can see it does pretty decent

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.270 
as you can see it does pretty decent
damage<00:02:54.180> next<00:02:55.180> move<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.690> hollow<00:02:56.470> giant<00:02:56.980> whoo

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
damage next move is hollow giant whoo

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.240

which<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.569> double<00:02:59.409> quarter<00:02:59.680> circle<00:03:00.040> forward

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
which is double quarter circle forward

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.170 
which is double quarter circle forward
why<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:04.209> similar<00:03:04.659> to<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:06.430> quarter<00:03:06.790> circle

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
why it's similar to the quarter circle

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.280 
why it's similar to the quarter circle
forward<00:03:07.510> attack<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.349> manoos<00:03:08.889> makho<00:03:09.849> has

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
except it's slower and I can only assume

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.979 
except it's slower and I can only assume
it<00:03:13.420> does<00:03:13.720> more<00:03:13.989> damage<00:03:15.359> plus<00:03:16.359> it's<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.660> super

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
it does more damage plus it's a super

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.939 
it does more damage plus it's a super
move<00:03:17.199> instead<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.799> broken<00:03:18.040> ass<00:03:18.370> special<00:03:19.030> and

in<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:43.000> air<00:05:43.259> unlike<00:05:44.259> the<00:05:44.409> other<00:05:44.530> tube<00:05:44.770> which

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
in the air unlike the other tube which

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.490 
in the air unlike the other tube which
are<00:05:45.099> ground<00:05:45.340> only<00:05:45.699> this<00:05:46.419> one<00:05:46.720> is<00:05:46.960> double

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
are ground only this one is double

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:56.969 
are ground only this one is double
quarter<00:05:47.770> circle<00:05:48.099> forward<00:05:48.310> Z<00:05:55.470> that's<00:05:56.470> pretty

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
quarter circle forward Z that's pretty

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.480 
quarter circle forward Z that's pretty
cool<00:05:57.720> alright<00:05:58.720> that's<00:05:59.319> Oliver<00:05:59.680> supers<00:06:00.310> I

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
cool alright that's Oliver supers I

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.460 
cool alright that's Oliver supers I
think<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.090> got<00:06:01.270> every<00:06:01.569> single<00:06:01.750> special<00:06:02.289> move

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
think I got every single special move

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.320 
think I got every single special move
she<00:06:02.620> has<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.129> Oliver<00:06:03.430> basics<00:06:03.879> in<00:06:04.060> Oliver

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
she has and Oliver basics in Oliver

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.830 
she has and Oliver basics in Oliver
supers<00:06:04.780> so<00:06:05.580> now<00:06:06.580> I<00:06:06.610> can<00:06:06.969> like<00:06:07.330> give<00:06:07.509> an<00:06:07.629> opinion

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
supers so now I can like give an opinion

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.369 
supers so now I can like give an opinion
of<00:06:08.139> her<00:06:08.259> um<00:06:08.969> she's<00:06:09.969> a<00:06:10.000> really<00:06:10.539> nice<00:06:10.780> start<00:06:11.199> rice

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
of her um she's a really nice start rice

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.110 
of her um she's a really nice start rice
pigeon<00:06:13.020> only<00:06:14.020> problems<00:06:14.440> are<00:06:14.710> is<00:06:15.099> that<00:06:15.159> I<00:06:15.669> found

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
pigeon only problems are is that I found

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.080 
pigeon only problems are is that I found
ass<00:06:16.389> minor<00:06:17.319> glitch<00:06:17.770> with<00:06:18.009> her<00:06:18.550> with<00:06:18.819> one<00:06:19.060> of

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
ass minor glitch with her with one of

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.629 
ass minor glitch with her with one of
her<00:06:19.240> basic<00:06:19.659> moves<00:06:19.900> if<00:06:20.800> you<00:06:20.949> use<00:06:21.069> it<00:06:21.219> too<00:06:21.400> close

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
her basic moves if you use it too close

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.600 
her basic moves if you use it too close
to<00:06:21.909> the<00:06:22.030> ground<00:06:22.120> this<00:06:23.080> one<00:06:23.289> it's<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.740> this

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
to the ground this one it's the this

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.459 
to the ground this one it's the this
move<00:06:24.849> if<00:06:25.599> you<00:06:25.659> use<00:06:25.719> it<00:06:25.930> too<00:06:26.080> close<00:06:26.199> to<00:06:26.379> the

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
move if you use it too close to the

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.959 
move if you use it too close to the
ground<00:06:26.620> you<00:06:26.949> just<00:06:27.159> fall<00:06:27.340> back<00:06:27.520> onto<00:06:27.789> the

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
ground you just fall back onto the

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.140 
ground you just fall back onto the
ground<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.889> you<00:06:29.889> kind<00:06:30.190> of<00:06:30.370> don't<00:06:30.759> use<00:06:31.000> the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
ground and you kind of don't use the

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:38.309 
ground and you kind of don't use the
move<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:35.039> also<00:06:36.039> I<00:06:36.340> feel<00:06:37.330> that<00:06:37.479> she<00:06:37.690> could<00:06:37.960> use

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
move and also I feel that she could use

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.490 
move and also I feel that she could use
a<00:06:38.349> little<00:06:38.860> bit<00:06:39.099> more<00:06:39.279> mechanics<00:06:39.909> like<00:06:40.569> she<00:06:40.870> she

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
a little bit more mechanics like she she

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.920 
a little bit more mechanics like she she
has<00:06:41.680> the<00:06:41.860> air<00:06:42.039> dash<00:06:42.340> and<00:06:42.610> stuff<00:06:42.880> but<00:06:43.630> aside

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
has the air dash and stuff but aside

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.180 
has the air dash and stuff but aside
from<00:06:43.990> that<00:06:44.199> she<00:06:44.349> doesn't<00:06:44.710> have<00:06:44.949> like<00:06:45.159> any

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
from that she doesn't have like any

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.779 
from that she doesn't have like any
other<00:06:45.880> special<00:06:46.509> mechanics<00:06:47.229> like<00:06:47.409> air<00:06:48.159> dodging

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
other special mechanics like air dodging

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.140 
other special mechanics like air dodging
or<00:06:48.909> whatever<00:06:49.240> or<00:06:49.650> roll<00:06:50.650> dodging<00:06:51.130> her<00:06:51.279> her

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
or whatever or roll dodging her her

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.779 
or whatever or roll dodging her her
fancy<00:06:52.569> stuff<00:06:52.750> like<00:06:52.900> that<00:06:52.930> so<00:06:53.860> she's<00:06:54.099> probably

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
fancy stuff like that so she's probably

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.170 
fancy stuff like that so she's probably
going<00:06:55.270> to<00:06:55.419> have<00:06:55.830> huge<00:06:56.830> disadvantages<00:06:57.819> against

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
going to have huge disadvantages against

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.120 
going to have huge disadvantages against
a<00:06:58.419> good<00:06:58.659> amount<00:06:58.870> of<00:06:59.080> Mugen<00:06:59.469> characters<00:06:59.919> that

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
a good amount of Mugen characters that

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.390 
a good amount of Mugen characters that
are<00:07:00.340> actually<00:07:00.520> competent<00:07:01.090> at<00:07:01.419> fighting

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
are actually competent at fighting

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.769 
are actually competent at fighting
meaning<00:07:03.400> ones<00:07:04.060> that<00:07:04.270> have<00:07:04.389> artificial

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
meaning ones that have artificial

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.860 
meaning ones that have artificial
intelligence<00:07:05.819> with<00:07:06.819> that<00:07:07.029> I<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.240> way<00:07:07.330> I<00:07:07.449> think

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
intelligence with that I the way I think

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.499 
intelligence with that I the way I think
the<00:07:08.020> character<00:07:08.409> is<00:07:08.440> really<00:07:08.919> well<00:07:09.099> made<00:07:09.129> I<00:07:09.610> kind

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:10.509 
the character is really well made I kind

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.519 
the character is really well made I kind
of<00:07:10.629> feel<00:07:10.810> you<00:07:11.050> could<00:07:11.500> have<00:07:11.860> well<00:07:12.580> I<00:07:13.529> can't

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:14.529 
of feel you could have well I can't

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:15.869 
of feel you could have well I can't
really<00:07:14.590> complain<00:07:15.099> about<00:07:15.310> the<00:07:15.550> sprites

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 
really complain about the sprites

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.430 
really complain about the sprites
because<00:07:16.270> I<00:07:16.389> don't<00:07:16.539> know<00:07:16.629> if<00:07:16.750> you<00:07:16.900> can<00:07:17.110> like

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
because I don't know if you can like

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.080 
because I don't know if you can like
make<00:07:17.650> your<00:07:17.860> own<00:07:18.009> and<00:07:18.400> I<00:07:18.490> know<00:07:18.550> they<00:07:18.849> take<00:07:19.029> a

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
make your own and I know they take a

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.269 
make your own and I know they take a
while<00:07:19.389> so<00:07:19.419> I<00:07:19.810> can<00:07:20.259> sort<00:07:20.560> of<00:07:20.650> understand<00:07:21.129> why

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:21.279 
while so I can sort of understand why

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:27.029 
while so I can sort of understand why
you<00:07:21.310> use<00:07:21.699> menus<00:07:22.560> mokou<00:07:23.560> sprites<00:07:24.870> um<00:07:25.870> and<00:07:26.770> aside

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 
you use menus mokou sprites um and aside

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.709 
you use menus mokou sprites um and aside
from<00:07:27.069> that<00:07:27.279> I<00:07:27.460> think<00:07:27.819> the<00:07:27.909> characters<00:07:28.090> really

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719 
from that I think the characters really

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.529 
from that I think the characters really
well<00:07:28.900> made<00:07:29.139> and<00:07:29.469> that<00:07:29.529> if<00:07:30.310> you<00:07:30.460> just<00:07:30.699> give<00:07:31.330> it<00:07:31.509> a

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
well made and that if you just give it a

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.649 
well made and that if you just give it a
giver<00:07:31.840> like<00:07:32.229> a<00:07:32.469> few<00:07:32.919> more<00:07:33.039> mechanics<00:07:33.659> she'll

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:34.659 
giver like a few more mechanics she'll

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.930 
giver like a few more mechanics she'll
be<00:07:34.690> perfect<00:07:35.430> with<00:07:36.430> that<00:07:36.610> out<00:07:36.789> of<00:07:36.819> the<00:07:36.879> way

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940 
be perfect with that out of the way

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.490 
be perfect with that out of the way
