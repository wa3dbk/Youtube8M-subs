okay so that's the intro part of the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.360 
okay so that's the intro part of the
song<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.740> here<00:02:52.740> comes<00:02:52.920> numbers<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
song and here comes numbers so for the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.130 
song and here comes numbers so for the
first<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.819> second<00:02:57.180> verse<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> same

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
first and second verse it's the same

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.720 
first and second verse it's the same
notes<00:02:58.380> as<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> intro<00:02:59.069> except<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.550> played

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
notes as the intro except you played

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.059 
notes as the intro except you played
differently<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.319> shouldn't<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.740> hard

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
differently so it shouldn't be that hard

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:12.030 
differently so it shouldn't be that hard
so<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:02.970> go<00:03:04.700> there's<00:03:05.700> no<00:03:05.819> play<00:03:06.000> once

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.160 

and<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.670> notes<00:03:13.879> are<00:03:14.120> d<00:03:14.480> sharp<00:03:14.689> and<00:03:14.959> C

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
and so the notes are d sharp and C

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.500 
and so the notes are d sharp and C
together<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:17.090> then<00:03:17.269> G

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.559 

F&amp;C<00:03:23.510> together<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.409> then<00:03:24.650> chief

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.780 

then<00:03:29.959> g<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:30.739> d<00:03:30.769> sharp<00:03:31.340> together<00:03:32.230> then<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.379> sharp

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.860 

and<00:03:37.790> F<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.420> D<00:03:38.480> together<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.650> sharp

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.010 

so<00:03:44.500> again<00:03:44.709> d<00:03:45.670> sharp<00:03:45.879> and<00:03:46.150> C<00:03:46.330> together

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
so again d sharp and C together

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.330 
so again d sharp and C together
then<00:03:48.650> G

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.979 

F&amp;C<00:03:53.340> together<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:54.330> she<00:03:54.540> shot

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.470 

G&amp;D<00:03:58.989> shot<00:03:59.200> together<00:03:59.379> and<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.010> nation

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.790 

F&amp;D<00:04:04.470> together<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.220> nation

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:27.710 

you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.600 

you

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.650 

you

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
you

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.890 
you
you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.290 

so<00:04:43.800> once<00:04:43.979> you<00:04:44.100> learn<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.310> verse<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:45.060> play<00:04:45.240> it

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
so once you learn the verse you play it

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.150 
so once you learn the verse you play it
four<00:04:45.540> times<00:04:45.780> until<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.380> hit<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.740> chorus<00:04:49.160> ok

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
four times until you hit the chorus ok

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.370 
four times until you hit the chorus ok
so<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.400> chorus<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.539> chorus<00:04:51.900> is<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.169> easiest

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
so the chorus the chorus is the easiest

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.620 
so the chorus the chorus is the easiest
part<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.800> song<00:04:53.070> well<00:04:53.880> for<00:04:54.090> me<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.300> is<00:04:54.419> just

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
part of the song well for me it is just

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.350 
part of the song well for me it is just
because<00:04:55.080> most<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.710> chords<00:04:56.070> are<00:04:56.280> are<00:04:56.669> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
because most of the chords are are the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.900 
because most of the chords are are the
same<00:04:57.630> except<00:04:58.080> for<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.320> last<00:04:58.530> part<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.580> it

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
same except for the last part so it

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:12.540 
same except for the last part so it
should<00:05:00.120> be<00:05:00.150> really<00:05:00.600> simple<00:05:00.979> so<00:05:01.979> here<00:05:02.160> we<00:05:02.220> go

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.110 

ok<00:05:13.450> so<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.720> notes<00:05:13.930> are<00:05:14.140> d<00:05:14.800> sharp<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.820> sharp

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
ok so the notes are d sharp and a sharp

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.820 
ok so the notes are d sharp and a sharp
together<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.860> then<00:05:17.980> see<00:05:18.630> then<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.930> sharp<00:05:20.200> D

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
together and then see then a sharp D

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.970 
together and then see then a sharp D
