00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.230
 and good morning to all of you 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.970
 what is gamer museum scenario 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.369
 found today for videotest 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.619
 project of 15 one of the most 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.900
 expected from this month of May so close to 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.000
 two years after his announcement plans cars 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.310
 arrives at the end of the month in any case on 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.680
 playstation 4 xbox one and pc version 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.330
 wii or low is still waiting for a 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.390
 little but what are the qualities 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.400
 of this game is really the big killer 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390
 turismo and forza motosport that all the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.140
 world thinks on the web 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.140
 let's discover together 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.270
 the first thing you notice 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.129
 it is obviously the menu that is 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.260
 wants rather intuitive and easy to 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.000
 understand the creation of a driver for 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.530
 a season is a great idea and the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.090
 scripting career mode in a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.010
 racing game is yet another 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.079
 when you start the first race it's 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.030
 the slap of the effects of light 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.739
 impressive modeling very 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.420
 faithful we would almost arrive at 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.130
 forget that we are in a video game 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.080
 the only shadow on the board comes from 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.640
 a few drops of fps that breaks the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.259
 sometimes speed sensations 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.750
 you trap during braking 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.759
 we juggle well not split 60 fps to 38 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.979
 were without any real reason 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.750
 but rest assured you go dingo the editor 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.490
 has already warned that it is she 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.929
 that problems are known and kpatcha is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.759
 currently under development for 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.660
 correct yes no date yet 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.450
 but it will come 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.300
 well let's face it we must salute the quality 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.800
 sounds of cars indoors if 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.660
 you say and the cockpit of your racing car 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.280
 the sounds produced by the vehicles do not 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.020
 are not the most loyal and earn a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.800
 little broken the many efforts lavished 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.090
 to respect realism 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.830
 also remains the fantasy of noises 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.480
 off track and let a little 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.780
 too noisy for a touch l2 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.790
 tracks 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.920
 we are going back here in the strong point of the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.200
 game against his competitors the damage 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.400
 are simply the most realistic 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.940
 never seen on a racing game 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.860
 automotive 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.270
 certainly it is still far from perfect 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.820
 and we can not help but note 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.980
 the colossal effort that was provided if 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.810
 well we could talk about the list of 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.440
 particularly short cars facing 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.880
 competition 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.530
 but the details modeled in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.210
 inside cars and even in the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.650
 engine compartment as well as the chassis 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.300
 which can be apparent with damage 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.770
 quickly understand that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.530
 little guys from home slightly mad studios 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.100
 have here to privilege the quality to the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.810
 amount 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.610
 it's something rare in 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.600
 racing games when we talk about quality 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.180
 greater than the quantity 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.740
 I think that today is 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.240
 in all games but fans of 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.530
 simulations will undoubtedly be filled 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 by this show this time in any case 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.850
 for his solo campaign plans 15 to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.350
 stands out from the competition 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.070
 again by proposing a 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.930
 new approach 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.820
 all vehicles being unlocked as soon as 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.840
 the beginning of the career nothing serves to 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.970
 bleed solo mode 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.920
 if it does not interest you no need to 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.120
 to hurt you if against you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.190
 do you want to create an alter ego 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.940
 oversized and virtual and build 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.040
 your legend 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.570
 you then have three options the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.770
 first is to launch your career 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.480
 in motor sport for 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.709
 concretely you'll just play 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.330
 a young pilot who launches into the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.430
 pretty basic motor racing 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.150
 second career option defend 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.410
 your title 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.360
 so here it's a little bit green one 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.709
 you will embody a pilot who has already 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.600
 the rank of world champion one 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.950
 category and who must keep his 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.540
 crown in order to have a chance of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.060
 move to the next category 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.500
 finally the third approach offers you 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.840
 simply to try to become champion 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.670
 in the series of your choice this 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.410
 modularity then rank the game fully 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.940
 interesting for a lot of people 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.230
 as much the casual player as the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.560
 champion who will bleed all the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.410
 categories on project of 15 found 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.300
 a little bit there 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.250
 approach that on forza motosport it's up to 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.560
 to say that a lot of ted islanding hope are 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.120
 available so that everyone can 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.620
 find a level of difficulty that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.360
 make the game accessible to its qualities 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.100
 braking pilot entirely 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.840
 insisted until a complete absence 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.760
 to be held hostage by going through the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.770
 all configurable parameters 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.090
 there's something for everyone tomorrow we 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.070
 will salute an artificial intelligence 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.410
 who even if she is far from 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.310
 perfect try at least a tiny 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.860
 little to avoid you 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.300
 it compensates however and largely by 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.560
 his fighting spirit and knows how to adapt 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.730
 according to the level of difficulty 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.470
 selected 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.060
 so she can be pretty hard at 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.100
 fight particular qualifications where 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.080
 lap times are pretty competitive 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.670
 good and then if that's not enough for you 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.780
 you still have the multiplayer of 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.640
 race weekends entirely 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.770
 configurable up to two sessions 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.510
 test the qualifications 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.910
 the warm up and two races maximum 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.190
 so you can set the duration of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.930
 each round and set completely 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.760
 both the weather and the brightness 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.050
 according to your tastes that she system of 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.490
 flags and resumed as in the real ones 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.930
 competition had blue flags 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.250
 to avoid it distancing and flags 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.260
 yellow green polka dot flags 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.580
 flags with pandas 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.110
 maybe not but at least there is the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.710
 automatic disqualification of 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.630
 suicide bombers 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.950
 tomorrow a system of penalties you 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.670
 includes throttle control during a 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.710
 time 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.600
 if you ever tried to cut the path 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.480
 besides that as much qualifications 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.010
 are directly invalidated of what 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.330
 ensure a good general atmosphere on 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.580
 online and then for the small 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.830
 comparison that stephen katic your pc 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.270
 and know that the console versions are 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.920
 are worth even though for the moment in 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.990
 waiting for patch there are some bugs 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.510
 on ps4 that we do not have on xbox one and 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.290
 conversely but otherwise it's worth 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.000
 pc 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.860
 it's a bit better optimized 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.260
 admit it if you have a good beast I 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.820
 precise a very good beast you go 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.920
 to please you with 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.550
 including cap compatibility that 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.590
 twelve chests 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.630
 that's the 36 case all you want 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.550
 good go small conclusion want 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.420
 we know about projects because it will be strong 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.040
 very strong very strong they 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.870
 realize the feat of walking on the 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.180
 flower beds and overtaking forza 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.860
 motosport and gran turismo by proposing 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.990
 an exceptional game on playstation case 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.120
 just like on xbox one and allows itself 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.860
 even the luxury of titill Corsican assetto to 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.540
 on pc without detracting them 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.890
 do not add too much either 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.360
 we will regret the lack of 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.520
 Vehicle customization at the level 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.110
 my aesthetic setting options 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.700
 and an immense they will allow 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.310
 directors developed fabricated well out 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.810
 of the project cars lot is undeniably 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.460
 an excellent simulation game 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.290
 automobile and is not close to 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.530
 to go out soon with not 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.030
 a lot of free and paid dlc and well 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.470
 sure do not forget the competition that is 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.180
 will develop over time especially 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.280
 on the French site comes from the game 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.900
 supported by the bandai-namco publisher and 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.400
 this is where the video test 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.570
 ends do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 the comments what you thought 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.080
 from the video and I also want to you 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.280
 thank because we are or in 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.230
 all the millions 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.910
 to tickle the thousand subscribers and 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.950
 frankly I thank you for being 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.270
 still so many and by the way I 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.090
 remind you that we launched our 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.590
 own Czech louis chef 5 streamer 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.910
 officials who are going to turn like that 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.710
 every week a little bit for 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.130
 offer you some gaming sessions 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.870
 different 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.740
 Briefly I will not spread myself over that's 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.000
 not the purpose of the video but you
