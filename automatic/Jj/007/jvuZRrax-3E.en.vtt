00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
very exciting and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.850 
very exciting and
and<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:12.210> lot<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.810> changes<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.320> think<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.710> biggest

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and a lot of changes I think the biggest

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
and a lot of changes I think the biggest
change<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.340> me<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.300> hard<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.630> say

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
change for me it's really hard to say

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.180 
change for me it's really hard to say
because<00:02:16.020> there's<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.470> many<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> biggest

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
because there's so many but the biggest

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
because there's so many but the biggest
change<00:02:17.550> would<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> face<00:02:18.330> where<00:02:18.870> he's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
change would be in the face where he's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.050 
change would be in the face where he's
taken<00:02:19.890> fat<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.280> put<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.460> back<00:02:20.550> into<00:02:20.760> my<00:02:20.880> face

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
taken fat and put it back into my face

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.810 
taken fat and put it back into my face
where<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.270> lost<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.540> volume<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
where I lost that volume and then of

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.670 
where I lost that volume and then of
course<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.180> natural<00:02:24.510> breast<00:02:25.050> augmentation<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
course the natural breast augmentation I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
course the natural breast augmentation I
think<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.130> most<00:02:26.670> excited<00:02:26.880> about<00:02:27.240> just

because as I've aged they just sort of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850 
because as I've aged they just sort of
disappear<00:02:30.420> unlike<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.750> men<00:02:31.050> who<00:02:31.320> get<00:02:31.530> boobs
