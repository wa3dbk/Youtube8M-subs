00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 and good that all that ulises 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.100
 commenting and extracting in play the black 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.450
 with everyone and as you are well is a 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.680
 game that is just started is 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.450
 an upside down war game which 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 it means that there are many people and how 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.259
 We were losing, there were 34 minutes left 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 to finish the game and you will see 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.430
 exactly why cross the entire map 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 stopping is heading somewhere that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.220
 another moment I know that it's been a long time 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.930
 so in fact I practically think that no 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.369
 done none here in black ops 2 but 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.630
 well let's go to it you see that we are 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.150
 appearing just at the other end 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 from the map I crossed the entire map to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 try to go as you are watching until the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 flag must and in this way capture it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 what is happening on this map can 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 play in your favor or against you it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.270
 answer the flag should if you are going to see and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.309
 you are going to give an account at the moment 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.930
 be here capturing the flag at 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.610
 modern to this area my colleagues are going to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 start to reappear here because we have 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.570
 just entered the enemies with my 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.739
 movement in the flag of cee I by 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.110
 the right of my colleagues who were 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 all 8 on the left and just 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.940
 move and here as they have been dying to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.770
 the skill looking next to me and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.809
 reappearing there then what is it that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.789
 happens we will be able to use say 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.260
 that what is a movement from one side to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 another he does not even need that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.450
 games with our classmates 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 it's much easier but if we do not 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.510
 and we play alone you can also win 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.400
 games is much more complicated because 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.260
 you have to do everything let's say the work 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 you alone but obviously you can also 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.960
 turn right right now I was here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.270
 placed right in the answer the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 enemy and my only goal was let's say 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.220
 that create a bit like chaos could 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.410
 to say is to be here so that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.850
 people should come to take 34 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.220
 enemies that were watching me 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.320
 all the time and this way oysters 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 try to have my colleagues have 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 I have to catch flags which is what 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.640
 happens that if your classmates pass 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.190
 Olympically to catch flags you have 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 that being the one who more or less will do 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.039
 all work then not good here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.520
 you are seeing that I am giving a little 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.470
 like cutting area have here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 500 took some streak because always 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.009
 they help and especially in terrestrial war 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 where they help a lot more because evils 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.399
 a lot more people with the streak already 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.800
 be an air support is a coarse that is 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.539
 but especially if we want streaks like 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.950
 uve sat if we throw radars 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.200
 this we can also use the other 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.810
 option that they stretched to the best what of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.239
 be or any run that is aerial and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.830
 I can do quite enough damage but 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.000
 happens that if our colleagues have not 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.080
 caught flags in all the time that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.050
 they had 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.090
 is that I still do not catch them in fact we're going 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.890
 to stop the screen and see again I 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.420
 only in this zone all my companions 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 on the other side where there is neither 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.170
 even flags and what happens to us 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.220
 enemies are appearing 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.900
 constantly in the area that I am 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.580
 right now my good partner is a 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.320
 little there I did not go to that house of 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.820
 there will go up whether it's changing or doing what 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.080
 let it be but nobody is going to come for the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.430
 flag and I'm alone by much 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.350
 we get on much that we 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.210
 a thousand gusts with which we can 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.490
 defend ourselves and we have air advantage but 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.930
 however this is not going to help and you're going 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.790
 let conceal what I sold what 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.040
 I meant that even if we were with 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.380
 a what to be and anything more than 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.820
 there was no enemy let's say 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.290
 near the flags the allies 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.209
 let's say we are one of those games 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.970
 where you are not going to do anything then 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.170
 well let's say more or less the idea 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 of this what can be done then 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.370
 get into the rest of the enemies and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.660
 to make it change is to say I have gotten 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.620
 in this area as you have seen killed 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.690
 a few the helicopter has 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.310
 helped and what has happened that 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.360
 we have changed the rest my classmates 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.860
 they are doing the same thing is to say no 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.090
 capture flags but at least 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.230
 be in the area where I do not come 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.820
 well so that the enemies do not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.260
 appear as you are seeing on this map 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.030
 they are the most complicated because he 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.650
 Answer is crazy 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.800
 well what I try as you are seeing 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.569
 it's just trying to manage my 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.950
 team simply with the rest not 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.390
 I intend to help me catch a 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.550
 flag I do not pretend that you gave me anything 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.500
 that but I want me to say 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.120
 help me and make a bundle 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.790
 seen another backup area shot more 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.319
 that nobody does not traitor so that for 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.459
 turn around with the objective 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.050
 simply that they turn around already 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.300
 You see, I feel like removing people 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.730
 that was on the flag should be removing 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.870
 the grains the and there has been moment 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.780
 what we have had a triple capture 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.010
 There have been times when we have gone 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.110
 pretty good but as you are seeing my 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.950
 only goal was to win the games me 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.390
 does not matter 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.010
 let's say let's say a super streak and 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.239
 the rest was a game that was not going to go up 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.570
 for any field simply because 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.550
 I wanted to win it again the bug and 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.780
 diego sta yes my companions because no 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.030
 they do nothing, not like we're losing 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.530
 if really the enemies who are 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.900
 super good numbers that are all has 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.430
 gone a super better level what you say 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.110
 that you see that the best thing is a super clan 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.870
 company entered was not not at all 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.160
 let's say very good people then he gave me 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.870
 rage I did not say how they can be 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.280
 winning these people and you have seen by 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.900
 example here that is riding all the time 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.160
 clean the areas clean the area 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.270
 beck is where I wanted my friends my 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.490
 colleagues were leasing 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.449
 to do nothing is to say championing himself 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.009
 they were doing the pool area 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.259
 so they did not do at least one 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.669
 where I could come could I 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.289
 come better not like saying well 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.340
 game is going to end practically me 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.470
 I do not try to do a bit here again 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.900
 more noise, he answered terrible 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.370
 all the enemies are screamed 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.020
 they are in this area I am agr is more or 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.460
 less out there killing me I'm 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.229
 controlling here I trained more 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.430
 be alive because I was alive here 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.740
 were going to appear the enemies for this 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.699
 zone as you are seeing and the only one that 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.979
 I have to give him this area to 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.270
 try all the time to increase say 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.460
 that I control only the flag should 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.659
 I want my colleagues had the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.849
 obsession to go for a flag for 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.770
 another mysterious end windows but of 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.030
 this flag here and with that we have 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.800
 won the game simply with that I 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.750
 I was in a place where my 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.979
 colleagues could get ahead then the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.659
 only option that has been left to them has been 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.370
 then come to reappear were the 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.530
 enemies and catch the same flag that 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.479
 they came out in it, so as you have 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.009
 seen simply by handling the response 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.240
 it's super simple simply by getting 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.430
 back athens you have to get 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.719
 try to take your teammates and I 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.729
 to have areas for us to appear 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.889
 enemies can be given to control well 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.360
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.190
 bar here or whatever you want to call it 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.200
 liked to vote it and see you next 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.710
 a single 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.710
 and good bye
