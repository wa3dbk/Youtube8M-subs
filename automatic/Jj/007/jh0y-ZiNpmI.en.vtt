00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
particular when you first had it done i

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
particular when you first had it done i
think<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> guy<00:00:57.809> did<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.109> said<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.469> would

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
think the the guy did it said that would

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.889 
think the the guy did it said that would
take<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> year<00:00:59.160> before<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.730> saw<00:00:59.969> saw<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.719> its

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
take a year before you saw saw it at its

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.740 
take a year before you saw saw it at its
best<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.000> i<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
best and and and i think the thing is it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
best and and and i think the thing is it
when<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.129> sort<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> weave<00:01:05.760> like

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
when you have that sort of weave like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
when you have that sort of weave like
that<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> doesn't<00:01:06.450> look<00:01:06.810> totally<00:01:07.170> natural

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that it doesn't look totally natural

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
that it doesn't look totally natural
because<00:01:07.830> most<00:01:08.100> men<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.520> some<00:01:09.119> gaps<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> they

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
because most men have some gaps and they

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.750 
because most men have some gaps and they
had<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> thick<00:01:10.830> fetch<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.549> that

thinning<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.030> don't

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
thinning so and just now I think I don't

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.609 
thinning so and just now I think I don't
know<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.360> long<00:01:42.479> had<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.720> how<00:01:43.140> long<00:01:43.320> ago<00:01:43.439> have

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
know how long had it how long ago have

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.020 
know how long had it how long ago have
it<00:01:43.740> done<00:01:43.860> maybe<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.220> three<00:01:44.549> months<00:01:44.670> ago<00:01:44.820> or

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
it done maybe about three months ago or

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.080 
it done maybe about three months ago or
so<00:01:45.149> hmm<00:01:45.619> it's<00:01:46.619> beginning<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.009> look<00:01:47.130> okay<00:01:47.909> he's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
so hmm it's beginning to look okay he's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.639 
so hmm it's beginning to look okay he's
getting<00:01:48.390> some<00:01:48.540> early<00:01:48.600> growth<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
getting some early growth there but you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.690 
getting some early growth there but you
are<00:01:49.799> correct<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.490> said<00:01:50.670> earlier

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
are correct in what you said earlier

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
are correct in what you said earlier
that<00:01:51.119> yeah<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:51.840> take<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.500> year

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that yeah it could take up to a year

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
that yeah it could take up to a year
before<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.850> could<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.570> hope<00:01:54.840> its

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
before you could see it it's hope its

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.950 
before you could see it it's hope its
full<00:01:55.560> potential<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> should<00:01:56.640> blend

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
full potential but it should blend

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.910 
full potential but it should blend
reasonably<00:01:57.960> naturally<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> rest<00:01:58.770> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
his hair and an amateur look very

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639 
his hair and an amateur look very

and<00:03:12.870> then<00:03:13.620> clip<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:13.980> short<00:03:14.280> because<00:03:14.490> they<00:03:14.970> just

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and then clip it short because they just

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.060 
and then clip it short because they just
like<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.570> clip<00:03:15.840> look<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:16.380> not<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.740> bold<00:03:16.920> look

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
you're right because of the number one

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.190 
you're right because of the number one
the<00:03:20.250> old<00:03:20.370> bald<00:03:20.790> pate<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.600> know<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> sort<00:03:22.110> of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
have not read the only thing that could

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.229 
have not read the only thing that could
not<00:03:53.040> go<00:03:53.190> wrong<00:03:53.220> zone<00:03:53.580> leases<00:03:53.820> as<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.090> could

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
not go wrong zone leases as it could

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.490 
not go wrong zone leases as it could
happen<00:03:54.390> with<00:03:54.690> Wayne<00:03:54.900> Rooney<00:03:54.930> early<00:03:55.380> because

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
happen with Wayne Rooney early because

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.400 
happen with Wayne Rooney early because
he<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.160> very<00:03:56.820> young<00:03:57.030> man<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.270> think<00:03:57.540> he's<00:03:57.690> 25

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
he is a very young man I think he's 25

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.680 
he is a very young man I think he's 25
or<00:03:58.620> something<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.790> his<00:04:00.150> young<00:04:00.360> age<00:04:00.390> and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
how quickly he lost his hair he could

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.310 
how quickly he lost his hair he could
still<00:04:02.610> lose<00:04:02.790> quite<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.150> lot<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.840> rest<00:04:04.170> of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
still lose quite a lot of the rest of

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.110 
still lose quite a lot of the rest of
his<00:04:04.410> head<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.800> transplanted<00:04:05.459> hair<00:04:05.610> and

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
his head not the transplanted hair and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.510 
his head not the transplanted hair and
if<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.420> was<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.750> happen<00:04:06.930> then<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.800> could<00:04:08.280> mean

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
if that was to happen then it could mean

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.190 
if that was to happen then it could mean
that<00:04:08.670> he<00:04:08.820> may<00:04:09.000> need<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.300> have<00:04:09.480> even<00:04:10.019> more

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
that he may need to have even more

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.949 
that he may need to have even more
surgery<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.100> not<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.550> may<00:04:11.780> create<00:04:12.780> a

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
surgery and if not it may create a

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.540 
surgery and if not it may create a
little<00:04:13.230> bit<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.440> imbalance<00:04:13.950> he<00:04:14.070> may<00:04:14.220> start<00:04:14.430> to

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
little bit of imbalance he may start to

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.280 
little bit of imbalance he may start to
look<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.850> bit<00:04:15.000> bold<00:04:15.420> at<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.720> back<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.900> his<00:04:16.140> head

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
look a bit bold at the back of his head

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.479 
look a bit bold at the back of his head
rather<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.830> front<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.190> that's<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> only

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
rather the front so that's the only

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.420 
rather the front so that's the only
thing<00:04:17.790> with<00:04:17.970> him<00:04:18.150> unless<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:19.350> mean<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.980> caution

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
thing with him unless I mean I caution

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.340 
thing with him unless I mean I caution
all<00:04:20.580> young<00:04:21.120> people<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.840> sometimes

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
all young people like that sometimes

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.870 
all young people like that sometimes
even<00:04:22.650> put<00:04:22.830> some<00:04:23.010> off<00:04:23.130> surgery<00:04:23.550> into<00:04:23.789> the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
even put some off surgery into the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.220 
even put some off surgery into the
better<00:04:24.060> later<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.390> chin

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
better later on chin

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.410 
better later on chin
pattern<00:04:25.920> is<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.490> he<00:04:26.670> may<00:04:26.850> say<00:04:27.060> he<00:04:27.240> may<00:04:27.360> be

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
pattern is that he may say he may be

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.200 
pattern is that he may say he may be
facing<00:04:28.430> significant<00:04:29.430> more<00:04:29.580> hair<00:04:29.760> loss<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.090> the

facing significant more hair loss in the
future<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.660> he<00:04:30.870> needs<00:04:31.050> proper<00:04:31.350> management<00:04:31.530> in

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
future and he needs proper management in

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.800 
future and he needs proper management in
that<00:04:32.070> respect<00:04:32.370> what<00:04:32.820> about<00:04:32.940> these<00:04:33.180> men<00:04:33.540> who
