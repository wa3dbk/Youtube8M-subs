00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

elite<00:01:15.000> darts<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.780> feel<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
maverick but it already has the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.610

than a stock maverick so let's put this
in<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.840> does<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.320> six<00:02:02.190> shots<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.680> feels

in it does have six shots in it feels

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.250 
in it does have six shots in it feels
really<00:02:04.920> smooth<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.570> can't<00:02:06.750> do<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.930> Russian

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
really smooth and you can't do a Russian

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.190 
really smooth and you can't do a Russian
Roulette<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.490> want<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.200> already

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
Roulette if you really want to already

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.130 
Roulette if you really want to already
out<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> box<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.070> already<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.370> some<00:02:11.670> fun

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
out of box you can already have some fun

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.190 
out of box you can already have some fun
let's<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.460> AR<00:02:15.060> pegs<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.990> like

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
let's see here the AR pegs are just like

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.530 
let's see here the AR pegs are just like
that<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.830> swarm<00:02:17.700> fire<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.210> those<00:02:18.390> should

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that of the swarm fire so those should

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050 
that of the swarm fire so those should
be<00:02:18.570> extremely<00:02:19.530> easy<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.830> get<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.460> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
be extremely easy to get out and the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.810 
be extremely easy to get out and the
plunger<00:02:21.570> has<00:02:21.960> some<00:02:22.350> padding<00:02:22.950> some<00:02:23.580> felt

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
plunger has some padding some felt

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.630 
plunger has some padding some felt
padding<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.840> weird<00:02:25.320> little<00:02:25.470> AR<00:02:26.040> system<00:02:26.550> in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
padding and a weird little AR system in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
padding and a weird little AR system in
there<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.060> shouldn't<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.900> too<00:02:28.050> hard<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.320> take

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
there so shouldn't be too hard to take

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.380 
there so shouldn't be too hard to take
the<00:02:28.620> air<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.040> let's<00:02:29.220> prime<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.180> back

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the air is out let's prime this back

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.640 
the air is out let's prime this back
once<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.900> guess<00:02:31.050> I'll<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.230> shoot<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> over

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
once and I guess I'll just shoot it over

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.700 
once and I guess I'll just shoot it over
here<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> seems<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.840> fairly<00:02:34.080> well<00:02:34.230> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
here then it seems to do fairly well I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.590 
here then it seems to do fairly well I
should<00:02:34.950> also<00:02:35.100> mention<00:02:35.280> how<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.270> barrel

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
should also mention how the barrel

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.650 
should also mention how the barrel
rotates<00:02:37.080> when<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.830> prime<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.190> back<00:02:38.660> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
rotates when you prime it back it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.360 
rotates when you prime it back it
doesn't<00:02:39.990> go<00:02:40.110> anywhere<00:02:40.320> when<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.160> push<00:02:41.340> it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
doesn't go anywhere when you push it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.340 
doesn't go anywhere when you push it
forward<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.790> doesn't<00:02:41.820> go<00:02:42.090> anywhere<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.570> when

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
forward it doesn't go anywhere but when

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.910 
forward it doesn't go anywhere but when
you<00:02:43.440> fire<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:45.230> turns<00:02:46.230> after<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.710> trigger

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you fire it it turns after the trigger

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.100 
you fire it it turns after the trigger
has<00:02:47.100> been<00:02:47.130> completely<00:02:47.820> pressed<00:02:48.180> down<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.960> is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
has been completely pressed down this is

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.510 
has been completely pressed down this is
an<00:02:49.200> interesting<00:02:49.410> mechanic<00:02:49.740> let's<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.430> that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
an interesting mechanic let's do that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.670 
an interesting mechanic let's do that
again

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
again

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.760 
again
there<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.800> go<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.700> um<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:55.230> gonna<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.440> much

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
there you go so um it's gonna be much

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.830 
there you go so um it's gonna be much
more<00:02:55.920> efficient<00:02:56.280> than<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> maverick<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.390> can

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
more efficient than a maverick but I can

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
more efficient than a maverick but I can
still<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.440> jamming<00:02:59.040> there<00:02:59.730> might<00:02:59.940> be<00:02:59.970> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
still see it jamming there might be a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.790 
still see it jamming there might be a
lot<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.330> get<00:03:00.450> around<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.230> far<00:03:01.440> I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
lot to get around this but so far I

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800 
lot to get around this but so far I
don't<00:03:02.370> know<00:03:02.640> now<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.180> we've<00:03:03.330> opened<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.690> up

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
don't know now that we've opened it up

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.750 
don't know now that we've opened it up
we're<00:03:04.050> obviously<00:03:04.290> gonna<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> range<00:03:05.130> test<00:03:05.459> so

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
we're obviously gonna do a range test so

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
we're obviously gonna do a range test so
let<00:03:05.910> me<00:03:06.000> set<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.390> up<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.660> we'll<00:03:07.320> get<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.650> it

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
let me set that up and we'll get to it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.100 
let me set that up and we'll get to it
oh<00:03:08.010> wait<00:03:08.489> for<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.209> firing<00:03:09.570> test<00:03:09.810> we're<00:03:10.020> gonna

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
oh wait for this firing test we're gonna

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.350 
oh wait for this firing test we're gonna
shoot<00:03:10.350> off<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.280> elite<00:03:11.580> darts<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.060> come<00:03:12.209> with

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
shoot off the elite darts that come with

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.890 
shoot off the elite darts that come with
it<00:03:12.390> first<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.860> I'm<00:03:14.070> gonna<00:03:14.190> shoot<00:03:14.430> off<00:03:14.640> a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it first and then I'm gonna shoot off a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.270 
it first and then I'm gonna shoot off a
variety<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.930> darts<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:17.010> right<00:03:17.250> here

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
variety of darts that I have right here

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.930 
variety of darts that I have right here
so<00:03:17.550> we<00:03:17.610> have<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:18.080> tagger<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.560> white<00:03:20.370> stream<00:03:20.730> line

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so we have a tagger a white stream line

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.800 
so we have a tagger a white stream line
with<00:03:21.360> eat<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.780> /<00:03:21.840> on<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.230> hole<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.739> Whistler<00:03:23.810> old

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
with eat a / on the hole a Whistler old

Buzzbee dart the Orion Buzzbee dart in a
regular<00:03:29.489> stream<00:03:29.910> line<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.930> first<00:03:31.260> we'll<00:03:31.380> start

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
regular stream line so first we'll start

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.640 
regular stream line so first we'll start
off<00:03:31.800> with<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.940> elite<00:03:33.720> darts<00:03:33.900> I'll<00:03:34.170> do<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.500> one

off with the elite darts I'll do the one

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.500 
off with the elite darts I'll do the one
at<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.830> time<00:03:35.010> first<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.610> then<00:03:35.820> I'll<00:03:35.940> reload<00:03:36.360> it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
at a time first and then I'll reload it

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.990 
at a time first and then I'll reload it
and<00:03:36.540> then<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:37.020> slam<00:03:37.350> fire<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.950> that's<00:03:38.640> my<00:03:38.760> first

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
and then do slam fire so that's my first

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.880 
and then do slam fire so that's my first
turtle<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.050> ground<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.380> know<00:03:40.470> how<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.680> works

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
turtle to ground you know how this works

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:52.970 
turtle to ground you know how this works
so<00:03:41.010> let's<00:03:41.220> see<00:03:41.430> how<00:03:41.580> this<00:03:41.730> does<00:03:43.040> over

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.380 

alright<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.100> there<00:03:54.250> we<00:03:54.310> go<00:03:54.490> let<00:03:54.700> me<00:03:54.790> reload<00:03:55.090> and

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
alright so there we go let me reload and

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.090 
alright so there we go let me reload and
we<00:03:55.660> will<00:03:55.810> do<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:55.990> again<00:03:56.050> now<00:03:56.710> I'm<00:03:56.800> going<00:03:57.010> to

this<00:06:09.449> really<00:06:09.930> really<00:06:09.990> fast<00:06:10.460> and<00:06:11.659> you<00:06:12.659> better

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
this really really fast and you better

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.829 
this really really fast and you better
start<00:06:13.080> running<00:06:13.229> so<00:06:13.680> I<00:06:14.509> kind<00:06:15.509> of<00:06:15.569> like<00:06:15.689> the

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:15.839 
start running so I kind of like the

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.600 
start running so I kind of like the
quick<00:06:16.080> six<00:06:16.439> I<00:06:16.770> don't<00:06:17.129> really<00:06:17.249> see<00:06:17.399> the<00:06:17.490> point

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
quick six I don't really see the point

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.790 
quick six I don't really see the point
of<00:06:17.699> having<00:06:17.789> to<00:06:17.969> slam<00:06:18.240> fire<00:06:18.479> on<00:06:18.689> this<00:06:18.930> I<00:06:19.169> think

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
of having to slam fire on this I think

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.219 
of having to slam fire on this I think
it's<00:06:20.039> kind<00:06:20.309> of<00:06:20.460> useless<00:06:21.360> because<00:06:21.749> you're<00:06:22.080> just

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
it's kind of useless because you're just

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.439 
it's kind of useless because you're just
gonna<00:06:22.409> just<00:06:23.399> be<00:06:23.550> shooting<00:06:23.729> a<00:06:23.969> mile<00:06:24.149> out<00:06:24.240> of<00:06:24.270> it

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
gonna just be shooting a mile out of it

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:25.519 
gonna just be shooting a mile out of it
and<00:06:24.569> you're<00:06:24.689> gonna<00:06:24.749> have<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.080> spend<00:06:25.319> a<00:06:25.379> lot<00:06:25.469> of

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529 
and you're gonna have to spend a lot of

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.579 
and you're gonna have to spend a lot of
time<00:06:25.710> reloading<00:06:26.159> besides<00:06:27.149> that<00:06:27.569> I<00:06:27.839> really<00:06:28.469> do
