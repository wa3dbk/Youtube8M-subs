experience<00:00:03.929> right<00:00:04.319> now<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.970> basically<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
experience right now and basically the

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.900 
experience right now and basically the
best<00:00:06.569> video<00:00:06.899> from<00:00:07.049> experience<00:00:07.440> at<00:00:07.560> now<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.950> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
best video from experience at now is to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.879 
best video from experience at now is to
just<00:00:09.090> farm<00:00:09.510> different<00:00:09.990> routes<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.410> each<00:00:10.559> act

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
just farm different routes for each act

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.560 
just farm different routes for each act
for<00:00:11.130> example<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:12.090> good<00:00:12.179> route<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
for example is one really good route the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
for example is one really good route the
next<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:14.009> good<00:00:14.099> routine

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
next one and one really good routine

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
next one and one really good routine
ektu<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.080> while<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.320> those<00:00:16.650> might<00:00:16.920> be

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
ektu and while one of those might be

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.490 
ektu and while one of those might be
more<00:00:17.190> XP<00:00:17.550> than<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> other<00:00:18.020> both<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.260> very

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
more XP than the other both are very

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349 
more XP than the other both are very
high<00:00:19.830> experience<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.550> if<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.820> found<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
high experience but how if you found the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.050 
high experience but how if you found the
red<00:00:21.510> zones<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.680> won't<00:00:22.920> explain<00:00:23.250> today<00:00:23.789> Dec

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
red zones and I won't explain today Dec

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.259 
red zones and I won't explain today Dec
1<00:00:24.330> root<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.199> usually<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.580> turns<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> be

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
1 root so usually this turns out to be

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
1 root so usually this turns out to be
around<00:00:27.630> 240<00:00:28.590> million<00:00:28.769> XP<00:00:29.130> per<00:00:29.250> hour<00:00:29.400> on

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
around 240 million XP per hour on

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.580 
around 240 million XP per hour on
average<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.660> more<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> calculations

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
average but more on the calculations

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
average but more on the calculations
later<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.070> gonna<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.489> show<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> around

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
later now I'm gonna just show it around

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030 
later now I'm gonna just show it around
so<00:00:33.719> first<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:34.950> to

start in the festering woods the reason

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.369 
start in the festering woods the reason
for<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.530> patch<00:00:38.219> 1.08<00:00:39.210> increased<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
for that is patch 1.08 increased the

umbrella<00:00:43.680> stacks<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> work

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
umbrella stacks now the work

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
umbrella stacks now the work
multiplicative<00:00:45.510> instead<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> additive<00:00:46.829> which

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
multiplicative instead of additive which

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010 
multiplicative instead of additive which
means<00:00:47.579> getting<00:00:48.000> five<00:00:48.270> stacks<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.870> an

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
means getting five stacks in an

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.479 
means getting five stacks in an
experience<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.739> definitely<00:00:50.160> worth<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
experience when it's definitely worth it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
experience when it's definitely worth it
so<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> you're<00:00:51.660> going

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to start with stone of trodden equip and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
to start with stone of trodden equip and
just<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> festering<00:00:54.660> words<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.140> as

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
just use the festering words to get as

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
just use the festering words to get as
many<00:00:55.800> stacks<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.280> possible<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> by

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
many stacks as possible you do is by

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
many stacks as possible you do is by
killing<00:00:58.199> elites<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.829> usually<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
killing elites I'm usually there to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
killing elites I'm usually there to
elites<00:00:59.879> outside<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.750> could<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.260> an

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
elites outside they could also be an

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.429 
elites outside they could also be an
event<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.879> spawns<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.480> purple<00:01:04.290> mob

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
event there and that spawns a purple mob

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.080 
event there and that spawns a purple mob
that<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:04.890> gives<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.159> stack<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that also gives a stack if you're a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
that also gives a stack if you're a
complete<00:01:06.420> event<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> two<00:01:07.830> dungeons

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
complete event and also the two dungeons

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
complete event and also the two dungeons
one<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> Boris<00:01:09.450> rest<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.320> other<00:01:10.439> one

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
one is the Boris rest and the other one

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920 
one is the Boris rest and the other one
is<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.979> pump<00:01:11.670> where<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> find<00:01:12.479> one

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
is the pump where you can find one

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
is the pump where you can find one
guarantee<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> lead<00:01:13.710> pack<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.070> each<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.760> after

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
guarantee the lead pack in each so after

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
guarantee the lead pack in each so after
you<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.299> four<00:01:15.659> stacks<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.110> something<00:01:16.470> that's

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you got four stacks or something that's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
you got four stacks or something that's
usually<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> end<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.340> pursuing<00:01:17.820> boats<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
usually I end up pursuing boats you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
usually I end up pursuing boats you
could<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.420> free<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.350> unlucky<00:01:19.530> okay

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
could have free if you're unlucky okay

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
could have free if you're unlucky okay
even<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.880> five<00:01:21.180> stacks<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> first

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500

chance for legendaries but feeds me

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.929 
chance for legendaries but feeds me
alone<00:01:57.740> it's<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.040> only<00:01:59.070> thing<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.850> are

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
alone it's not the only thing there are

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
alone it's not the only thing there are
two<00:02:00.180> very<00:02:00.509> good<00:02:00.689> dungeons<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
two very good dungeons one is the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
two very good dungeons one is the
scavengers<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.930> around<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
scavengers then which has around the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.780 
scavengers then which has around the
same<00:02:04.530> experience<00:02:04.950> views<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.189> misery<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.670> it's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
same experience views of misery so it's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
same experience views of misery so it's
definitely<00:02:06.149> worth<00:02:06.360> doing<00:02:06.570> every<00:02:07.049> time<00:02:07.229> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
definitely worth doing every time you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.440 
definitely worth doing every time you
see<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> scavengers<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.129> then<00:02:08.429> go<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
see the scavengers get then go in to a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.220 
see the scavengers get then go in to a
loop<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> go<00:02:10.349> out<00:02:10.440> again<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
loop and go out again that's it

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080

have a hike it barbarian yeah this is a
lot<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.160> experience<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:37.879> on<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.000> later

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
lot of experience but more on that later

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.150 
lot of experience but more on that later
and<00:02:38.629> then<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.410> are<00:02:39.470> almost<00:02:39.590> at<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.890> end<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.069> a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and then we are almost at the end of a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.970 
and then we are almost at the end of a
run<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.269> last<00:02:41.480> spot<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.019> holes<00:02:42.440> agony

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
run so the last spot is the holes agony

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.470 
run so the last spot is the holes agony
which<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.459> also<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:44.150> really<00:02:44.180> good

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
which is also really really good

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.030 
which is also really really good
experience<00:02:44.810> for<00:02:45.140> our<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.590> boosting<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
experience for our it's boosting the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.979 
experience for our it's boosting the
experience<00:02:46.430> power<00:02:46.579> rate<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.870> should

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
experience power rate and so you should

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.380 
experience power rate and so you should
do<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> full<00:02:48.620> PF<00:02:48.890> Volkswagen<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.549> now<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.329> you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
do a full PF Volkswagen a now but you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.960 
do a full PF Volkswagen a now but you
can<00:02:50.510> also<00:02:50.750> do<00:02:50.989> is<00:02:51.109> if<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.640> prefer<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> longer

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
can also do is if you prefer a longer

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
can also do is if you prefer a longer
runs<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.329> me<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.870> post<00:02:54.079> go<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.440> crust

hold<00:02:55.010> however<00:02:56.230> experience<00:02:57.230> vice<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.620> not

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
hold however experience vice it's not

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:58.930 
hold however experience vice it's not
really<00:02:57.980> worth<00:02:58.129> it<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.730> other<00:02:58.819> hand

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
really worth it but on the other hand

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.000 
really worth it but on the other hand
you<00:02:59.090> don't<00:02:59.239> use<00:02:59.480> much<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:00.650> lose<00:03:00.829> a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
you don't use much so you just lose a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.729 
you don't use much so you just lose a
very<00:03:01.970> small<00:03:02.599> amount<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.930> experience<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:03.500> also

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
very small amount of experience we also

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.680 
very small amount of experience we also
integrate<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.370> cost<00:03:04.609> hold<00:03:04.849> in<00:03:04.970> your<00:03:05.000> runs<00:03:05.269> but

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
integrate the cost hold in your runs but

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.020 
integrate the cost hold in your runs but
you<00:03:05.810> make<00:03:05.959> your<00:03:06.230> runs<00:03:06.709> longer<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.370> probably

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you make your runs longer and probably

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.720 
you make your runs longer and probably
more<00:03:08.209> fun<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.930> often<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.799> also<00:03:10.370> go<00:03:10.519> there

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
more fun so I often just also go there

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.640 
more fun so I often just also go there
because<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.359> think<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.750> nice<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.260> lay<00:03:12.500> some

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
because I think it's nice to lay some

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.280 
because I think it's nice to lay some
skeletons<00:03:13.129> and<00:03:13.450> that's<00:03:14.450> pretty<00:03:14.810> much<00:03:14.930> make

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
skeletons and that's pretty much make

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.890 
skeletons and that's pretty much make
one<00:03:15.500> run<00:03:15.650> now<00:03:15.829> okay<00:03:16.669> so<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.940> may<00:03:17.209> act<00:03:17.480> one

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
one run now okay so this may act one
