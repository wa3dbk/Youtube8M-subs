00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.690
 curd filling is very tender 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.760
 reminds cream and pies themselves to taste 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.469
 like cakes 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.309
 Of course for this you need the best 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:19.050
 fresh cottage cheese 500 grams of raisin half a cup 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.960
 and one more little egg needs raisins 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.630
 pour boiling water for 5 minutes in cottage cheese 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 beat egg and put at least 3 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.570
 tablespoons of sugar can be put in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.559
 two times more sugar if you like 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.460
 sweet and now all this needs to be stirred 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.460
 until uniform 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.000
 I pour water from raisins it should not be 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.030
 limp to this point but only 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.449
 slightly swollen with boiling water 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.640
 add raisins to cottage cheese and knead more 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.550
 I want to warn about this moment when 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.280
 you will buy cottage cheese choose one 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.050
 which is well pressed and does not have a sour 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.909
 taste 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.820
 sour taste says that roads 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.490
 no longer fresh and it is consistency 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.479
 should be such that not smeared 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.270
 like a round and kept a lump so that you can 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.170
 it was him to chop off crush that is 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.280
 dry cottage cheese 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 as you see after adding eggs 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 sugar and wet i eat and stuffing 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.280
 it turns out not dry, but such as mashed potatoes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.479
 it is generally done very quickly and easily 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 you see 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.560
 in 10 minutes we will have time to cook it 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.440
 the dough will fit more time and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.780
 while you can grease margarine baking sheet 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.250
 I have 2 aluminum and steel 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 enamelled 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.130
 thanks to margarine, pastries do not burn 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.380
 Well, you can already start cutting 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 the dough must first be divided 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.789
 in half and one part I clean while you can 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.160
 simply cover with a towel can be about 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.370
 take the pot for now so that it does not 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.879
 cool it was warm and now every 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.819
 the part we will cut into small squares 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:25.900
 I fit on one baking sheet 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:30.489
 12-15 pies that is, we need this 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.959
 divide a piece of dough by about 3 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.080
 rows of five pieces of squares such and here 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.940
 as i suggest they sculpt cakes will 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.290
 open from the corners 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.689
 as if envelopes 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.969
 what dough you don't need to roll 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:51.170
 my hands stretch our square 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.709
 the dough is very easy stretches nice on 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.459
 touch 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.720
 it's easy to work with him now 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:04.069
 curd about one tablespoon of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.489
 diagonally dispose stuffing and now 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.120
 wrap up corners how to wrap 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.670
 curd dough 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.620
 It turned out such a bundle 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.370
 one corner inside turns out to be another 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.189
 outside 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.220
 it is desirable that the outer corner 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:25.310
 was brought under the bottom so that the pie 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.730
 lay on that corner then during 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.129
 baking the pie won't open you can not 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.560
 populating blind from this test and this 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.010
 stuffing the usual form of patties 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.700
 This is someone like it, but I still 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.040
 love the variety of fillings and shapes and what 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.449
 and share with you and you probably already understood 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.060
 why cottage cheese should be well pressed 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:53.299
 if there is liquid curd, then he just 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.639
 will emerge from the pie open area 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:01.879
 cottage cheese must be dry and finally 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.750
 fasten the pie of the usual form will show 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.569
 you and 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.109
 triangle pie I generally love 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.629
 make surprises and stuffing change and shape 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.690
 change and almost always have a few 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:18.799
 fillings in one cooking 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.620
 that is, then the pies are put on one 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.280
 dish with different fillings of different shapes 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.979
 and every pie is a surprise that is not 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.340
 you know what filling you get but in 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.190
 Basically they are all delicious, you can not 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.430
 thinking no doubt 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:41.200
 take any stuffing eat everyone likes 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.440
 i.e. this is a win-win lottery 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.380
 I think that each filling has its own 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.190
 virtues but overall i can't choose 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.950
 which one is the most successful well here 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.800
 we put on pies and now we need 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.950
 lubricate their egg for this will need 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.740
 the brush can not smear the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.930
 does not affect just the egg makes baking 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:13.090
 brilliant and ruddy pike i'm patties and when 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:18.890
 temperature 200 250 degrees 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:22.090
 10-15 minutes they are baked here is our baking 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.090
 and ready 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.050
 take it off the baking sheet and invite everyone to 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.050
 the table 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:43.030
 very elegant dessert turned out just 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:47.110
 sight their scent is extraordinary 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:50.570
 of course I don't want to grab but 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.350
 make these cakes taste more tender 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.890
 gentle 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.020
