many<00:00:43.649> videos<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> consistently<00:00:46.140> as

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
many videos you know and consistently as

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.569 
many videos you know and consistently as
well<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> want<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> make<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:47.010> videos<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.370> lot

more consistently like every two or
three<00:00:49.079> days<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.460> be
