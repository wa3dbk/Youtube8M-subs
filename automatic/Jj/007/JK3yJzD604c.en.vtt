00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
add costume I started to see movement

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
add costume I started to see movement
three<00:00:45.059> dimensionally<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
three dimensionally and so it just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
three dimensionally and so it just
happened<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.149> afraid<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
happened for me and I was very afraid to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
happened for me and I was very afraid to

it and see dance like you're feeling
something<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:11.189> choreography<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.659> me

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
something I think choreography for me

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
something I think choreography for me
it's<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.770> about<00:01:13.890> stringing<00:01:14.400> together

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's not just about stringing together

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's not just about stringing together
movement<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.900> wow<00:01:16.409> somebody

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
movement to just wow somebody

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
movement to just wow somebody
choreography<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> language<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.229> move<00:01:19.500> my

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
choreography is a language if I move my

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
choreography is a language if I move my
hand<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.369> there's<00:01:20.580> always<00:01:20.880> intention

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hand that there's always intention

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
hand that there's always intention
behind<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.020> i'm<00:01:22.200> reaching<00:01:22.470> towards<00:01:23.189> something

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
behind it i'm reaching towards something

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
behind it i'm reaching towards something
and<00:01:23.939> pounding<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:24.780> chest<00:01:24.869> doesn't<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and pounding in my chest doesn't want to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.340 
and pounding in my chest doesn't want to
feel<00:01:26.250> something<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:27.180> ignite<00:01:27.810> an

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
feel something that will ignite an

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.600 
feel something that will ignite an
energy<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.640> find<00:01:30.619> game-changing<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.829> think

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
energy to find game-changing I think

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.870 
energy to find game-changing I think
game-changing<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.689> me<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.829> doing<00:01:35.189> an<00:01:35.430> award

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
game-changing for me when doing an award

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630 
game-changing for me when doing an award
show<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> Grammys<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.710> to

elevate<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.659> performance<00:01:40.320> by<00:01:40.500> doing

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
elevate the performance by doing

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.609 
elevate the performance by doing
something<00:01:41.100> unexpected<00:01:42.259> for<00:01:43.259> me<00:01:43.290> that's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
something unexpected for me that's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
something unexpected for me that's
game-changing<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> everybody<00:01:45.270> thought

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
game-changing is that everybody thought

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.850 
game-changing is that everybody thought
that<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> performance<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.320> look<00:01:46.680> like

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that the performance would look like

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
that the performance would look like
this<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.759> make<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.420> the
