00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 And so people are welcome there 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 There is one more video and this time I bring 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.470
 here you go boxing guys this 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.440
 here o 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.710
 minecraft card are collectible cards 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.260
 in fact I have no idea what kind of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.359
 letter that is this and I do not intend 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.359
 collecting the guys because this here 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.130
 It will be my dear, but I bought it to see. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.080
 How's it going to make a box here? 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 You beauty, I think I paid one. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.609
 a little euro each I bought 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 three for us to open here so let's go 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.989
 there I want to see what these are like 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.660
 meat I do not know if it has this in Brazil 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.420
 if I'm not mistaken, guys, I'll show you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.399
 again trying to focus here is also 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590
 difficult light house to try to light up 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.219
 on here 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.870
 I think the focus is on the best, so do not 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.760
 not 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.649
 for those over three years and here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.550
 I think it was even better without 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.579
 light 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.059
 I had seen that it was made in spain 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.980
 are fooling me is ok ago was no longer 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 in focus but anyway it's written there mahdi 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.140
 in Spain 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 Come on people here, it's older I 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.180
 I said I'd do not collect business is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 of the old order is calm and one of each 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.200
 turn 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 first letter gang is a goin sheep and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.000
 it seems that it only has a circle in 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 Back I do not know if it's to take out I think 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.770
 no and athletic is random net with one 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.570
 normal background here we have the inter 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.210
 interesting dragon is your dragon is kind 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.460
 it seems to me that it's a puzzle behind 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 I do not know if it's going to be a puzzle 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.579
 right after the end 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.799
 finally we have here a pig galera and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.040
 behind also breaks down part of the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.700
 puzzle part of the puzzle there 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.229
 to cnet a little packaging that speaks 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.680
 here you want to risk is action 24 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.950
 characters to collect are not 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.899
 so many 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.850
 I thought it would be more difficult 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.659
 they are probably the ones here guys 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.489
 Let's try to show what you can see. 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.910

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.709

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.670
 I bought three each one come three I will have 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.180
 wonder folks well I think here that is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.519
 same thing, I do not think it does any 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.590

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.110

 average brushing wonder in beauty 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.010
 six cards I think the agent 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.109
 got everything repeated until 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.980
 Now, let's go to the last galera, come on. 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.230
 for the last one that is interesting 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.200
 Old man is not repeating that 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.850
 cool, people, slime, slime, too 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.400
 skeleton 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.799
 the cards are very simple in the gallery and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.359
 another here I've been version 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.450
 I do not even know what she's called 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.609
 But finally, I'll see if it will 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.260
 to put a puzzle here one 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.600
 part of the puzzle, I'll go 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.660

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.389

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.790
 Let the people place the cards here at the table. 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.130
 just so you all see here a 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.380
 on the other side that the lighting is 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.599
 catching relief but not 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.000
 You have not even seen a dragon here and 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.459
 slime now we will try to put together a 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.049
 turning these letters I 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.010
 I do not know if it's to do this I think 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.540
 Yes, right 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.329
 and let's see if we can ride 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.660
 at least a part here I do not know how 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.569
 there are few letters 24 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.269
 I'm 9, maybe I can put something together. 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.740
 for example the stive's arm looks only at 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.940

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:21.770
