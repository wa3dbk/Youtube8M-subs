the engine on engine comes on and then

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.990 
the engine on engine comes on and then
it<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.510> rises<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.410> then<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.040> turn<00:01:38.790> it

it kind of rises up and then you turn it
now<00:01:39.180> there's<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.660> little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.080> lag<00:01:40.320> it's

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
now there's a little bit of a lag it's

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.200 
now there's a little bit of a lag it's
not<00:01:40.800> much<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> takes<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.850> don't<00:01:42.150> know

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
not much but it takes I don't know

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
not much but it takes I don't know
second<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.900> two<00:01:43.050> for<00:01:43.410> it<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> rise<00:01:43.980> up<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.430> then

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
second or two for it to rise up and then

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.390 
second or two for it to rise up and then
unlock<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.900> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.140> rotate<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
unlock so that you can rotate it if you

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.980 
unlock so that you can rotate it if you
like<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.790> kind<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> jam<00:01:48.960> it

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.070 
because this thing's pretty light only
3,600<00:02:10.380> miles<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:11.780> comes<00:02:12.780> along

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
3,600 miles it actually comes along

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.010 
3,600 miles it actually comes along
pretty<00:02:13.350> well<00:02:13.440> here's<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> engine<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.810> does

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
pretty well here's the engine it does

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.199 
pretty well here's the engine it does
0-60<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.650> about<00:02:16.890> seven<00:02:17.220> point<00:02:17.490> four<00:02:17.700> seconds

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
0-60 in about seven point four seconds

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.090 
0-60 in about seven point four seconds
which<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> about<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.900> same<00:02:19.050> as<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.350> x3<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
which is about the same as the x3 in the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.890 
which is about the same as the x3 in the
q5<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:22.530> thing<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.660> there<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.870> no

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
q5 but one thing is that there is no

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.460 
q5 but one thing is that there is no
optional<00:02:25.590> engine<00:02:25.980> that's<00:02:26.280> all<00:02:26.519> there<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
optional engine that's all there is you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.650 
optional engine that's all there is you
can<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> six<00:02:29.220> cylinder<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.880> both<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
can get a six cylinder in both of you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.900 
can get a six cylinder in both of you
five<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> x3<00:02:31.769> one<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> other<00:02:32.850> things

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
five and the x3 one of the other things

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.509 
five and the x3 one of the other things
too<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.620> vehicle<00:02:34.860> still<00:02:35.040> only<00:02:35.340> has

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
too is that this vehicle still only has

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.590 
too is that this vehicle still only has
a<00:02:35.550> 6-speed<00:02:37.040> automatic<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.280> both<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.090> X<00:02:39.239> 3<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
a 6-speed automatic and both the X 3 and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
a 6-speed automatic and both the X 3 and
the<00:02:39.660> q5<00:02:40.019> now<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.500> eight-speed<00:02:41.040> automatics

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the q5 now have eight-speed automatics

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.310 
the q5 now have eight-speed automatics
but<00:02:42.360> overall<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.930> pretty<00:02:43.110> cool

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
but overall this is a pretty cool

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.960 
but overall this is a pretty cool
vehicle<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> think<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.340> kind<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
vehicle I think it's kind of like the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.479 
vehicle I think it's kind of like the
old<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.360> suzu<00:02:45.720> vehicross<00:02:46.320> if<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.190> remember

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
old I suzu vehicross if you remember

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.430 
old I suzu vehicross if you remember
that<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.660> sense<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.170> really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that one in the sense that it's really

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.410 
that one in the sense that it's really
different<00:02:50.010> looking<00:02:50.400> from<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.300> about

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
different looking from just about

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.030 
different looking from just about
anything<00:02:51.630> else<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.140> road<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:52.620> unlike<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
anything else on the road but unlike the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.449 
anything else on the road but unlike the
vehicross<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.790> actually<00:02:54.090> pretty<00:02:54.330> practical

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
vehicross it's actually pretty practical

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.000 
vehicross it's actually pretty practical
so<00:02:56.459> that's<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.420> for<00:02:57.660> review<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.440> over<00:02:58.530> eat<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so that's it for review is over eat the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
so that's it for review is over eat the
autos<00:02:59.310> com<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:00.630> catch<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.810> with<00:03:01.019> you
