00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
ducting in it the rest doesn't but this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.370 
ducting in it the rest doesn't but this
heats<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.360> rest<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.780> home<00:02:26.960> pretty

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
heats the the rest of the home pretty

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.830 
heats the the rest of the home pretty
efficiently<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:29.000> not<00:02:29.150> gonna<00:02:29.270> make<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.480> sauna

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
efficiently it's not gonna make a sauna

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.900 
efficiently it's not gonna make a sauna
out<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.260> my<00:02:30.380> home<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.310> heats<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.670> pretty

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
out of my home but it heats it pretty

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.900 
out of my home but it heats it pretty
well<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:33.110> makes<00:02:33.350> us<00:02:33.530> comfortable<00:02:34.010> which<00:02:34.760> is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.600 
well it makes us comfortable which is
nice<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.570> it'll<00:02:35.990> if<00:02:36.230> you're<00:02:36.830> looking<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.430> save

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
nice and it'll if you're looking to save

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.460 
nice and it'll if you're looking to save
some<00:02:37.850> money<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:38.210> your<00:02:38.330> heating<00:02:38.480> bill<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:39.050> think

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
some money on your heating bill I think

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.750 
some money on your heating bill I think
this<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.980> definitely<00:02:40.130> it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
this is definitely it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.290 
this is definitely it
the<00:02:41.030> blower<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.050> little<00:02:42.530> bit<00:02:42.650> loud<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:44.000> that

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the blower is a little bit loud and that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.320 
the blower is a little bit loud and that
might<00:02:44.540> be<00:02:44.570> an<00:02:44.810> issue<00:02:44.960> for<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.790> if<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.060> put<00:02:47.240> it

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
might be an issue for you if you put it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.770 
might be an issue for you if you put it
in<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.510> room<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:48.230> want<00:02:49.480> surround<00:02:50.480> sound

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
in a room that you want surround sound

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.550 
in a room that you want surround sound
you<00:02:51.140> know<00:02:51.530> movie<00:02:52.160> environment<00:02:52.790> whatever<00:02:53.560> but

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you know movie environment whatever but

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.470 
you know movie environment whatever but
if<00:02:54.890> not<00:02:55.190> if<00:02:55.490> you<00:02:55.760> don't<00:02:55.940> care<00:02:56.120> about<00:02:56.240> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
if not if you don't care about the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.090 
if not if you don't care about the
blower<00:02:56.690> being<00:02:56.990> loud<00:02:57.230> then<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.710> not<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.890> big

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
blower being loud then it's not a big

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.940 
blower being loud then it's not a big
deal<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:59.090> works<00:02:59.300> really<00:02:59.540> well<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.620> only

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
deal and it works really well the only

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.410 
deal and it works really well the only
other<00:03:01.100> thing<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.670> would<00:03:01.820> recommend<00:03:02.360> that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
other thing is I would recommend that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.450 
other thing is I would recommend that
you<00:03:02.510> read<00:03:02.780> all<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.110> instructions<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:03.980> watch

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
you read all the instructions and watch

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.190 
you read all the instructions and watch
the<00:03:04.520> video<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.600> shows<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:06.020> how<00:03:06.140> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the video because it shows you how to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.540 
the video because it shows you how to
build<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.530> fire<00:03:06.740> as<00:03:06.920> long<00:03:07.070> as<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.250> build<00:03:07.460> the

build the fire as long as you build the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.330 
build the fire as long as you build the
fire<00:03:07.760> correctly<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:09.020> monitor<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.800> draft

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
fire correctly and you monitor the draft

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.730 
fire correctly and you monitor the draft
until<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.940> drafting<00:03:11.390> properly<00:03:11.900> you'll<00:03:12.410> you

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
until it's drafting properly you'll you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.860 
until it's drafting properly you'll you

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
properly with the proper heat you're not

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.890 
properly with the proper heat you're not
supposed<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.520> heat<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:22.940> up<00:03:23.150> quickly<00:03:23.780> you're

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
supposed to heat it up quickly you're

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.390 
supposed to heat it up quickly you're
supposed<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.170> heat<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.470> slowly<00:03:24.770> so<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.160> the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
supposed to heat it slowly so that the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.150 
supposed to heat it slowly so that the
paint<00:03:25.670> will<00:03:25.970> cure<00:03:26.300> but<00:03:27.110> keep<00:03:27.590> those<00:03:27.710> things<00:03:27.980> in

paint will cure but keep those things in
mind<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.520> think<00:03:28.910> relatively<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:30.020> good

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
