00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone who has 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.529
 have a lathe sooner or later 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.019
 facing the need of turning 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 spheres 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.450
 there are enough techniques of such work 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.520
 a lot and today i will show you one of them 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.650
 it's called copier method and we are from 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.310
 what kind of billets do we make here 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.099
 here's the ball for a start we need hands 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 the ball that we will copy to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.710
 far away weeks take this one on 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.910
 threaded stud chuck we secured 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.670
 our stocking 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.370
 and in exactly the same way but already all 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 Belem button tailstock we fasten on 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 the ball which we will copy in 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.750
 tool post and we fasten two 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.809
 identical forests in my case it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 cutting discs it is important that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.539
 cutting edges culinary height and on 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.010
 one distance from the tool holder then 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 there are absolutely symmetrical 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.580
 Well, then everything is just elementary here 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.930
 these places will in this area and the same 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.930
 we get from this side 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.600
 in my case or manufacturing accuracy 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.120
 This little ball is required 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.580
 he will still be refined with sandpaper 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.400
 so stiffness with this whole system 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.260
 it is generally at such a minimum 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.600
 level, that is, Christ can, in principle, 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.090
 bend this ball a little bit but for this 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.310
 I am not critical if you need 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.610
 highest accuracy and the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.370
 ball mount which is copied and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.880
 billet should be maximized 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.880
 tough 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.560
 after a little polishing we get here 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.930
 such a ball as we see the system 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.299
 making it easy enough 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.219
 make not only round 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.140
 but also any other difficult surfaces and 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.200
 and your exactness depends but stiffness 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.099
 Thank you for watching the installation. 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.099
 and be healthy
