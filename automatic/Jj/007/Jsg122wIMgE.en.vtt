00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.850 
uh that one shot power that he used to
have<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.049> lower<00:02:28.290> weight<00:02:28.560> classes

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
have in the lower weight classes

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.080 
have in the lower weight classes
especially<00:02:29.870> 135<00:02:30.870> where<00:02:31.260> uh<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.730> know<00:02:32.819> if<00:02:32.940> he

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
especially 135 where uh you know if he

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.729 
especially 135 where uh you know if he
put<00:02:33.299> together<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.660> combination<00:02:34.170> he<00:02:34.470> could<00:02:34.620> hurt

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
put together a combination he could hurt

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.030 
put together a combination he could hurt
anybody<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.989> this<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.170> definitely<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
anybody and this is definitely not the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.789 
anybody and this is definitely not the
case<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.540> welterweight<00:02:39.750> division<00:02:40.049> and

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
case in the welterweight division and

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.630 
case in the welterweight division and
Amir<00:02:41.370> Khan<00:02:42.260> certainly<00:02:43.260> he's<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.799> complete

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
Amir Khan certainly he's a complete

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.610 
Amir Khan certainly he's a complete
unknown<00:02:44.849> in<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.360> welterweight<00:02:45.510> division<00:02:45.810> so

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
unknown in the welterweight division so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.350 
unknown in the welterweight division so
both<00:02:46.799> these<00:02:47.010> guys<00:02:47.250> they're<00:02:48.000> not<00:02:48.150> even

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
both these guys they're not even

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.589 
both these guys they're not even
welterweight<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.819> makes<00:02:51.000> sense<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.359> fight

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
welterweight so it makes sense to fight

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.089 
welterweight so it makes sense to fight
each<00:02:51.720> other<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.109> sell<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.319> full-blown<00:02:52.859> guy
