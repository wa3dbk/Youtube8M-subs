see people suffer although i do but
because<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.580> interesting

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
because i think it's really interesting

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
because i think it's really interesting
first<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> first<00:01:07.080> person<00:01:07.140> mod<00:01:07.560> so

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
first because it's a first person mod so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
first because it's a first person mod so
you<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.340> their<00:01:08.490> actions<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.030> second

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you get to see their actions and second

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
you get to see their actions and second
you<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.140> i<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.860> watch<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> ones

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you get to see i like to watch the ones

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
you get to see i like to watch the ones
where<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> pros<00:01:12.119> play<00:01:12.330> off<00:01:12.659> rates

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
where they know the pros play off rates

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
where they know the pros play off rates
because<00:01:13.470> they're<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.890> necessarily<00:01:13.979> playing

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
because they're not necessarily playing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
because they're not necessarily playing
optimally<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.509> could<00:01:15.659> pick<00:01:15.810> up<00:01:15.990> on

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
optimally and you could pick up on

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350 
optimally and you could pick up on
things<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.460> players<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.180> things

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
things that on players you know things

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
things that on players you know things
that<00:01:18.450> players<00:01:18.720> may<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.200> optimally<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that players may not do optimally and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
that players may not do optimally and
sort<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> learn<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.600> almost<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.229> looks

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
sort of learn from that almost it looks

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
sort of learn from that almost it looks
like<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:22.860> spotted<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.400> opponent<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
like he has spotted the opponent at the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.730 
like he has spotted the opponent at the
three<00:01:24.689> o'clock<00:01:24.840> position<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> opponent<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
three o'clock position the opponent is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
three o'clock position the opponent is
tearing<00:01:26.159> by<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> way<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> red<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.600> not

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
tearing by the way in red and I'm not

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390 
tearing by the way in red and I'm not
sure<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.170> he's<00:01:28.530> gotten<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.220> he<00:01:29.340> has

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
sure if I'm he's gotten I think he has

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.710 
sure if I'm he's gotten I think he has
gotten<00:01:29.700> close<00:01:29.880> enough<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.390> pulled<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
gotten close enough that they pulled and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.660 
gotten close enough that they pulled and
probably<00:01:31.079> has<00:01:31.229> spotted<00:01:31.439> him<00:01:31.650> also<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.610> I'm

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
probably has spotted him also but I'm

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
probably has spotted him also but I'm
not<00:01:32.790> sure<00:01:32.850> about<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.329> since<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
not sure about that since the there is a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 
not sure about that since the there is a
building<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.579> he<00:01:36.150> has<00:01:36.240> spotted<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
building there he has spotted the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.850 
building there he has spotted the
building<00:01:36.840> i'm<00:01:36.930> pretty<00:01:37.290> sure<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> upon<00:01:37.680> his

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
building i'm pretty sure the upon his

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
building i'm pretty sure the upon his
body<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:39.119> exactly<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.689> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
body and I'm not not exactly sure in in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.749 
body and I'm not not exactly sure in in
case<00:01:39.900> um<00:01:40.220> looks<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.310> he's<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> be

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
case um looks like he's not going to be

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
case um looks like he's not going to be
going<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> nine<00:01:42.270> poor<00:01:42.509> anything<00:01:42.810> he's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
going for a nine poor anything he's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
going for a nine poor anything he's
going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> three<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.220> drones<00:01:44.549> after

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
going to get a three more drones after

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.960 
going to get a three more drones after
his<00:01:44.909> overlord<00:01:45.270> comes<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.640> yeah<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.820> we'll

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
his overlord comes out and yeah so we'll

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
his overlord comes out and yeah so we'll
see<00:01:48.119> how<00:01:48.149> his<00:01:48.630> serve<00:01:49.079> vs<00:01:49.439> terran<00:01:49.590> play<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
see how his serve vs terran play is I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
see how his serve vs terran play is I
would<00:01:51.030> expecting<00:01:51.450> him<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.810> mean<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> seems<00:01:52.320> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
would expecting him I mean it seems that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.080 
would expecting him I mean it seems that
when<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> pros<00:01:52.829> are<00:01:52.979> playing<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.399> rays<00:01:53.640> they

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
when the pros are playing off rays they

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.300 
when the pros are playing off rays they
actually<00:01:54.450> play<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> standard<00:01:55.560> game<00:01:55.799> in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
actually play more of a standard game in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
actually play more of a standard game in
the<00:01:56.399> opening<00:01:56.759> perhaps<00:01:57.479> pues<00:01:57.689> are<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.110> used

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the opening perhaps pues are not so used

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.160 
the opening perhaps pues are not so used
to<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:59.130> doing<00:01:59.430> rush<00:01:59.610> build<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.600> actually

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to just doing rush build and so actually

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
to just doing rush build and so actually
we're<00:02:01.290> seeing<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> UH<00:02:01.619> we're<00:02:02.490> seeing<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> think

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
we're seeing the UH we're seeing I think

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
we're seeing the UH we're seeing I think
an<00:02:03.030> engineering<00:02:03.420> Bay<00:02:03.570> they're<00:02:03.780> pleased<00:02:04.439> by

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
an engineering Bay they're pleased by

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
an engineering Bay they're pleased by
the<00:02:04.680> amateur<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.490> order<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.790> block<00:02:06.170> reaches

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the amateur in order to block reaches

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
the amateur in order to block reaches
build<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.890> his<00:02:08.310> natural<00:02:08.489> expansion<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
build of his natural expansion that's a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.580 
build of his natural expansion that's a
clever<00:02:09.360> move<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> amateur<00:02:10.259> certainly

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
clever move so the amateur certainly

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
clever move so the amateur certainly
knows<00:02:10.770> where<00:02:10.950> reaches<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:12.180> actually

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
knows where reaches and that actually

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.960 
knows where reaches and that actually
that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.740 
that
SCB<00:02:13.750> got<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:14.080> surprisingly<00:02:14.650> early<00:02:14.890> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
SCB got there surprisingly early so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.520 
SCB got there surprisingly early so
actually<00:02:16.750> I'm<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:16.900> sure<00:02:17.050> I'm<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> might've

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
actually I'm not sure I'm it might've

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.200 
actually I'm not sure I'm it might've
been<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.680> SUV<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.250> built<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:18.910> first

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
been just SUV that built this first

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.970 
been just SUV that built this first
applied<00:02:19.480> evil<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.110> got<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:20.680> quite<00:02:20.860> early

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
applied evil but I got there quite early

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.320 
applied evil but I got there quite early
and<00:02:21.130> that's<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.640> clever<00:02:21.850> move<00:02:22.060> there

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
and that's actually a clever move there

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.090 
and that's actually a clever move there
it's<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.080> prevent<00:02:23.350> reach<00:02:23.860> from

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
it's going to prevent reach from

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's going to prevent reach from
building<00:02:24.640> his<00:02:24.790> uh<00:02:24.820> his<00:02:25.150> natural<00:02:25.660> expansion

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
building his uh his natural expansion

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.350 
building his uh his natural expansion
for<00:02:26.260> quite<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.710> while<00:02:27.010> while<00:02:27.310> he<00:02:27.460> destroys<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
for quite a while while he destroys that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.450 
for quite a while while he destroys that
and<00:02:28.740> anticipating<00:02:29.740> reaches<00:02:30.010> build<00:02:30.220> quite

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
and anticipating reaches build quite

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.730 
and anticipating reaches build quite
well<00:02:30.610> here<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:32.200> actually<00:02:32.320> he's<00:02:32.620> quite

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
well here so that actually he's quite

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.760 
well here so that actually he's quite
clever<00:02:32.920> by<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.340> Terran<00:02:33.610> player<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:35.170> so

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
clever by this Terran player and so

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.560 
clever by this Terran player and so
reaches<00:02:36.100> gonna<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.580> fight<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.330> with

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
reaches gonna have to fight this with

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.210 
reaches gonna have to fight this with
those<00:02:38.050> two<00:02:38.230> drones<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.590> reach<00:02:38.710> now<00:02:38.950> gaining

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
those two drones and reach now gaining

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.450 
those two drones and reach now gaining
his<00:02:39.400> uh<00:02:39.460> his<00:02:39.850> his<00:02:40.510> well<00:02:41.080> he's<00:02:41.410> he<00:02:41.710> tries<00:02:41.980> trying

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
his uh his his well he's he tries trying

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.580 
his uh his his well he's he tries trying
to<00:02:42.550> get<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> hatchery<00:02:42.910> down<00:02:43.270> there<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.260> need<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
to get a hatchery down there you need to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.470 
to get a hatchery down there you need to
get<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.770> hatchery<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.340> immediately<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.209> think

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
get a hatchery down immediately I think

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.790 
get a hatchery down immediately I think
you<00:02:46.540> should<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.750> done<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:46.900> actually<00:02:47.350> like

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
you should have done that actually like

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.760 
you should have done that actually like
30<00:02:48.040> seconds<00:02:48.430> ago<00:02:48.610> just<00:02:48.850> place<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.240> ha's<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
30 seconds ago just place the ha's the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.500 
30 seconds ago just place the ha's the
second<00:02:51.220> hatchery<00:02:51.550> somewhere<00:02:51.850> else<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.330> then

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
second hatchery somewhere else and then

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
second hatchery somewhere else and then
after<00:02:53.290> destroying<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.860> building<00:02:54.190> place<00:02:54.790> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
after destroying that building place the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.760 
after destroying that building place the
correct<00:02:55.360> position<00:02:55.600> for<00:02:55.959> mining<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.650> case

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
correct position for mining but in case

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.530 
correct position for mining but in case
I<00:02:56.800> reach<00:02:57.340> now<00:02:57.520> getting<00:02:57.760> his<00:02:57.850> spawning<00:02:58.090> pool<00:02:58.300> so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
I reach now getting his spawning pool so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.600 
I reach now getting his spawning pool so
it<00:02:59.380> looks<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.310> guess<00:03:00.459> he's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
it looks like I'm going to guess he's

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
it looks like I'm going to guess he's
going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.820> go<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.300> third<00:03:01.840> hatchery<00:03:02.230> because

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
going to go for a third hatchery because

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.470 
going to go for a third hatchery because
otherwise<00:03:03.280> he's<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:03.610> not<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.090> mind

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
otherwise he's just not going to mind

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.150 
otherwise he's just not going to mind
correctly<00:03:04.930> at<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.140> expansion<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.040> he's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160

a third third hatchery at the correct

a third third hatchery at the correct
position<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.769> um<00:03:32.920> i<00:03:33.100> guess<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.550> opponent<00:03:33.970> did

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
position but um i guess the opponent did

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.400 
position but um i guess the opponent did
slow<00:03:34.300> him<00:03:34.390> down<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.570> little<00:03:34.660> bit<00:03:34.930> because<00:03:35.080> reach

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
slow him down a little bit because reach

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.140 
slow him down a little bit because reach
was<00:03:35.590> confused<00:03:36.010> for<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.190> second<00:03:36.489> about<00:03:36.790> what<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
was confused for a second about what the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.280 
was confused for a second about what the
correct<00:03:37.330> responses<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.019> correct

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
correct responses and the correct

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.720 
correct responses and the correct
response<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.010> just<00:03:39.370> plant<00:03:39.610> your

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
response to that is to just plant your

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.610 
response to that is to just plant your
hatchery<00:03:40.090> elsewhere<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:41.080> worry<00:03:41.560> about

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
hatchery elsewhere and then worry about

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.070 
hatchery elsewhere and then worry about
the<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.370> correct<00:03:42.580> positioning<00:03:43.120> later<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
the the correct positioning later so the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.830 
the the correct positioning later so the
opponent<00:03:44.410> actually<00:03:44.620> did<00:03:44.769> well<00:03:44.950> there<00:03:45.130> in

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
opponent actually did well there in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.600 
opponent actually did well there in
stopping<00:03:46.840> him<00:03:46.959> for<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.170> second<00:03:47.680> there<00:03:47.799> in<00:03:48.430> any

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
stopping him for a second there in any

coming up I guess he just didn't rally
enough<00:05:32.020> over<00:05:32.290> there<00:05:32.440> I'd<00:05:32.560> he<00:05:32.680> reaches

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
enough over there I'd he reaches

actually held this rush off when I felt
the<00:05:35.620> opponent<00:05:36.190> could<00:05:36.280> have<00:05:36.400> killed<00:05:36.610> him<00:05:36.790> off

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
the opponent could have killed him off

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.490 
the opponent could have killed him off
right<00:05:37.120> there<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:37.570> incredible<00:05:38.110> rush<00:05:38.290> by<00:05:38.470> the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
right there so incredible rush by the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.920 
right there so incredible rush by the
random<00:05:39.460> bailed<00:05:39.640> on<00:05:39.790> that<00:05:39.850> user<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.480> this<00:05:40.780> is

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
random bailed on that user and this is

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.510 
random bailed on that user and this is
where<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.110> was<00:05:41.260> saying<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.590> don't<00:05:42.310> know<00:05:42.430> if<00:05:42.490> I

over there so in a case I was saying
that<00:06:15.760> it's<00:06:16.090> kind<00:06:16.270> of<00:06:16.360> like<00:06:16.480> poker<00:06:16.750> if<00:06:17.410> you<00:06:17.560> were

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090

percent<00:06:37.330> chance<00:06:37.510> of<00:06:37.690> winning<00:06:37.960> uh<00:06:38.080> you<00:06:38.440> know

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
percent chance of winning uh you know

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.690 
percent chance of winning uh you know
basically<00:06:39.010> a

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
basically a

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.960 
basically a
before<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.210> flop<00:06:40.710> but<00:06:41.710> if<00:06:41.830> you're<00:06:41.980> it's<00:06:42.910> the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
before the flop but if you're it's the

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.580 
before the flop but if you're it's the
same<00:06:43.090> thing<00:06:43.150> because<00:06:43.570> if<00:06:43.660> you<00:06:43.750> try<00:06:43.990> to<00:06:44.050> play

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
same thing because if you try to play

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.770 
same thing because if you try to play
normal<00:06:45.580> sized<00:06:45.730> pots<00:06:46.030> with<00:06:46.240> them<00:06:46.360> you're<00:06:46.600> just

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
normal sized pots with them you're just

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.880 
normal sized pots with them you're just
going<00:06:46.930> to<00:06:46.990> get<00:06:47.050> outplayed<00:06:47.350> if<00:06:47.620> you're<00:06:47.710> playing

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
going to get outplayed if you're playing

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.830 
going to get outplayed if you're playing
like<00:06:48.040> Phil<00:06:48.340> Ivey<00:06:48.640> and<00:06:48.820> the<00:06:49.240> same<00:06:49.390> case<00:06:49.600> here

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
like Phil Ivey and the same case here

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.930 
like Phil Ivey and the same case here
this<00:06:50.290> to<00:06:50.860> adjust<00:06:51.220> to<00:06:51.340> playing<00:06:51.460> a<00:06:51.670> pro<00:06:51.910> player

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
this to adjust to playing a pro player

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.880 
this to adjust to playing a pro player
here<00:06:52.450> it<00:06:52.600> seems<00:06:52.810> that<00:06:52.960> the<00:06:53.200> best<00:06:53.470> way<00:06:53.620> probably

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
here it seems that the best way probably

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.860 
here it seems that the best way probably
is<00:06:54.160> to<00:06:54.280> go<00:06:54.400> in<00:06:54.520> for<00:06:54.700> a<00:06:54.730> rush<00:06:55.000> and<00:06:55.210> to<00:06:55.630> try<00:06:55.810> to

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
is to go in for a rush and to try to

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.390 
is to go in for a rush and to try to
take<00:06:56.050> out<00:06:56.170> the<00:06:56.350> pro<00:06:56.500> player<00:06:56.680> early<00:06:57.010> on<00:06:57.040> and

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
take out the pro player early on and

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.040 
take out the pro player early on and
this<00:06:57.940> Terran<00:06:58.210> player<00:06:58.300> certainly<00:06:58.750> hasn't

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
this Terran player certainly hasn't

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.480 
this Terran player certainly hasn't
succeeded<00:06:59.350> in<00:06:59.620> taking<00:06:59.740> him<00:06:59.980> out<00:07:00.070> but<00:07:00.220> he<00:07:00.280> has

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
succeeded in taking him out but he has

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.640 
succeeded in taking him out but he has
weakened<00:07:00.910> reached<00:07:01.150> quite<00:07:01.390> a<00:07:01.420> lot<00:07:01.600> reach<00:07:02.290> only

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
weakened reached quite a lot reach only

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.650 
weakened reached quite a lot reach only
now<00:07:02.830> Mining<00:07:03.700> gas<00:07:03.850> again<00:07:04.180> looks<00:07:04.390> like<00:07:04.510> he

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
now Mining gas again looks like he

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.420 
now Mining gas again looks like he
finally<00:07:05.140> is<00:07:05.200> going<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:05.440> aspire<00:07:05.710> up<00:07:05.920> I<00:07:06.070> feel

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
finally is going to aspire up I feel

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.680 
finally is going to aspire up I feel
that<00:07:06.460> this<00:07:06.700> Terran<00:07:07.210> player<00:07:07.300> because<00:07:07.540> should

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
that this Terran player because should

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.270 
that this Terran player because should
actually<00:07:07.840> be<00:07:08.050> able<00:07:08.440> to<00:07:08.560> push<00:07:08.770> out<00:07:08.950> by<00:07:09.100> now
