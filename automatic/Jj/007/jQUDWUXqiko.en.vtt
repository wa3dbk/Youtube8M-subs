00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
wasn't drying it wasn't boring because I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.170 
wasn't drying it wasn't boring because I
wasn't<00:02:13.989> getting<00:02:14.170> trimmed<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.430> would<00:02:15.700> hold

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
wasn't getting trimmed and I would hold

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.320
