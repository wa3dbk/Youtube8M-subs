 the environment 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.810
 environment is all that is ours.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 the human beings 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.840
 ecology is the science that studies the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.500
 relations between the elements of the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.500
 environment 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.180
 three quarters of the surface of the planet 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 land is covered by water 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 one room only constitutes the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 continents bedrock is 97% water 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:58.320
 considered salted 2% are available 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.920
 in the polar ice caps in the form of 1% 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 only fresh water found in rivers 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.500
 lakes and bridges of this 1% 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 are in difficult locations. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.430

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.110
 Brazil has 12% of the freshwater 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.869
 but 8% are in the Amazon region 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.040
 1 billion people in the world already suffer 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.040
 with lack of water 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.020
 much of the available fresh water 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.020
 pollution levels 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 pollution is the unfavorable change in 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.150
 environment 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.049
 sub products resulting from the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.049
 human activity 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.700
 are problems caused in relation to the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.920
 transit and the environment air pollution 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.350
 caused by the emission of smoke by 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.670
 motor vehicle noise pollution 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:09.009
 caused by vehicles with exhausts 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:13.569
 deregulated accidents with vehicles 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.569
 transporting dangerous goods 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:26.420
 floods caused by debris 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.310
 or abandoned in the main gases 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.459
 emitted during the burning of 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.000
 carbon dioxide fuels that are not 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.170
 toxic carbon monoxide kills 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.670
 Chemical and choking generated hydrocarbons 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.160
 in the evaporation of aldehyde fuels 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.549
 generated in the burning of the alcohol of 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.120
 sulfur oxides of nitrogen cause 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.459
 acid rain 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.829
 the nitrogen oxide and 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.320
 sulfur present in nature 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.690
 eruption of volcanoes and composition of 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.269
 plants are also expelled by 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.390
 factory chimneys and exhaust 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.120
 vehicles informing the acid rain that 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.299
 cause environmental damage and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.299
 vehicles 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.350
 natural gas gnv pollutes less 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.650
 that alcohol or alcohol pollutes less than 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.440
 and halve the amount of monoxide 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.799
 of carbon in relation to gasoline 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.160
 so add alcohol to gasoline 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.160
 aimed at reducing gasoline pollution 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.790
 less polluting diesel than biodiesel is 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.880
 more pollutant produces smoke, soot and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.859
 dust aggravating respiratory diseases 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.079
 irritating eyes and throat to 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.660
 to reduce pollution caused by 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:58.630
 motor vehicles the driver shall 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.630
 keep the engine of the vehicle well regulated 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.390
 are three equipment developed 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:08.060
 to minimize injection pollution 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.879
 electronics that is more economical and pollutes 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.760
 less and the canister that is placed in the 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:17.900
 out of the fuel tank and absorbs 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.389
 vapors by sending them to the engine and the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.479
 catalyst that transforms the effects 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.220
 toxic gases in gas water 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.220
 carbon dioxide and nitrogen 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.470
 the ozone layer is situated in a 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.750
 range ranging from 15 to 20 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.370
 mile high it protects the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.440
 earth against the action of lightning 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.139
 ultraviolet sun 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.389
 the layer has been degraded due to 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.870
 pollution and, above all, 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:51.199
 as to the indiscriminate use of cfc 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.150
 chlorofluorocarbon used in air sprays 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.979
 conditioning and refrigerators 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.229
 experts are claiming that the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.650
 the ozone layer is recovering 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:06.349
 again due to reduced production and 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.630
 use of sef if the greenhouse effect is 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.599
 heating the lower layers of the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.210
 atmosphere at normal greenhouse 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.010
 solar radiation returns the space 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:21.740
 reflecting to earth 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:24.020
 only the heat needed in the effect 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.199
 greenhouse gas the excess of 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:32.090
 pollution retains more heat preventing its 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.550
 return to space the main 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.690
 the greenhouse effect is gas 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.930
 750 billion tons 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.080
 is the total co2 in the atmosphere currently 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:49.250
 sea ​​level may increase by 88 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.740
 centimeters by 2100 causing flooding 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.800
 experts say that the polar cap 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.479
 melt in the next 100 years 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.789
 the noise pollution the excess noise 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.199
 constitutes a major change in the quality of 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.300
 of the environment 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.190
 motor vehicles are the 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.330
 the main sources of pollution in 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.330
 large urban centers 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.950
