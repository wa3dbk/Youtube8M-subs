go about pronouncing that correctly the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.060 
go about pronouncing that correctly the
CNB<00:00:36.450> 150<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.860> light<00:00:38.190> panel<00:00:38.809> micro<00:00:39.809> Pro<00:00:40.170> in

terms<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> construction<00:00:41.820> both<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.480> pretty

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
terms of construction both are pretty

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.110 
terms of construction both are pretty
much<00:00:42.899> equal<00:00:43.309> both<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.489> made<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> lightweight

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
much equal both are made of lightweight

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
much equal both are made of lightweight
plastic<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.200> probably<00:00:46.620> wouldn't<00:00:46.770> survive<00:00:47.190> a

four-foot drop on concrete in fact I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.080 
four-foot drop on concrete in fact I
don't<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.340> things<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.760> survive

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
don't think these things would survive

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.930 
don't think these things would survive
just<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.230> few<00:00:52.440> years<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.860> constant<00:00:53.340> use<00:00:53.370> before

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
just a few years of constant use before

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
just a few years of constant use before
breaking<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.559> expecting<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.280> metal

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
breaking I was kind of expecting a metal

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
case for the light panel because there's

killed it it was my fault I was kind of
taken<00:01:23.100> back<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> read

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
a note like that to me the circuitry

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.359 
a note like that to me the circuitry
design<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:28.920> thought<00:01:29.340> out

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
design is not really well thought out

and it has no fault protection built in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
and it has no fault protection built in
the<00:01:32.579> next<00:01:32.850> thing<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.270> disappointed

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the next thing that really disappointed

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.660 
the next thing that really disappointed
me<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> light<00:01:34.439> panel<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.310> light

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.520 
me in the light panel was the light
level<00:01:36.090> control<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.320> much

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
level control but it's just as how much

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.039 
level control but it's just as how much
light<00:01:37.860> comes<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> unit<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.720> can

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
light comes out of the unit as you can

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
light comes out of the unit as you can
see<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:40.950> half<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> travel<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> the

quarter turn this is not the case for
the<00:01:49.500> canova<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.220> didn't<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.270> better<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the canova I didn't know better the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
the canova I didn't know better the
person<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.350> designing<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.979> circuitry

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
person that was designing the circuitry

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910 
person that was designing the circuitry
just<00:01:53.820> biffed<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.200> it's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just biffed it on this one and it's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
just biffed it on this one and it's
totally<00:01:56.280> using<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> wrong<00:01:57.090> type<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
totally using the wrong type of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
totally using the wrong type of
potentiometer<00:01:58.350> my<00:01:58.829> guess<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.250> they're<00:01:59.430> using

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
potentiometer my guess is they're using

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.789 
potentiometer my guess is they're using
a<00:01:59.820> logarithmic<00:02:00.329> pot<00:02:00.780> instead<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.439> linear

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
a logarithmic pot instead of a linear

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.069 
a logarithmic pot instead of a linear
one<00:02:01.979> however<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.570> way<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.869> light

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
one however I do like the way the light

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.289 
one however I do like the way the light
panel<00:02:04.320> mounts<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> light<00:02:05.549> stand<00:02:05.820> better

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
panel mounts on a light stand better

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.630 
panel mounts on a light stand better
than<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.659> canova<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:07.860> test<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> seems<00:02:08.489> like

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
than the canova in my test it seems like

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
than the canova in my test it seems like
the<00:02:08.759> canova<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:10.020> bit<00:02:10.140> more<00:02:10.349> light

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the canova a little bit more light

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.940 
the canova a little bit more light
output<00:02:11.370> than<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> light<00:02:12.209> panel

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
output than the light panel

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.740 
output than the light panel
and<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.489> was<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.819> bit<00:02:14.000> more<00:02:14.150> directional

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and it was a little bit more directional

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
and it was a little bit more directional
since<00:02:15.620> both<00:02:15.800> manufactures<00:02:16.459> don't<00:02:16.670> publish

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
first and did all this stuff so why is

perhaps<00:03:40.970> canola<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.690> using<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.109> cheaper<00:03:42.560> LED

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069

perhaps canola is using a cheaper LED
that's<00:03:43.670> more<00:03:43.970> efficient<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.690> green

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
that's more efficient in the green

more green tint I'm not really sure that

this<00:03:59.239> matters<00:03:59.690> much<00:03:59.959> since<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.709> might<00:04:00.920> not<00:04:01.160> be

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
this matters much since it might not be

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.009 
this matters much since it might not be
the<00:04:01.489> light<00:04:01.730> that's<00:04:01.910> issue<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.569> might<00:04:02.720> be<00:04:02.870> the

the light that's issue it might be the

the light that's issue it might be the

the<00:04:04.670> issue<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.540> know<00:04:05.599> you<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:06.079> go<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.530> buy

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
the issue and I know you can go and buy

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.460 
the issue and I know you can go and buy
a<00:04:07.040> whole<00:04:07.340> bunch<00:04:07.519> of<00:04:07.730> gels<00:04:08.000> cheaply<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:09.349> are

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
a whole bunch of gels cheaply that are

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.289 
a whole bunch of gels cheaply that are
like<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:09.950> different<00:04:10.519> increments<00:04:11.180> like

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
like in different increments like

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.449 
like in different increments like
quarter<00:04:11.720> CTO<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.799> all<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.069> different<00:04:13.250> stuff

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
quarter CTO and all this different stuff

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.640 
quarter CTO and all this different stuff
I<00:04:13.790> don't<00:04:14.090> know<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:14.450> I'll<00:04:14.599> I'll<00:04:14.840> get<00:04:15.349> around

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
I don't know but I'll I'll get around

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.349 
I don't know but I'll I'll get around
testing<00:04:15.919> it<00:04:16.160> maybe<00:04:16.340> it's<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.120> gel

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
testing it maybe it's just that the gel

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.659 
testing it maybe it's just that the gel
that's<00:04:17.630> not<00:04:17.870> very<00:04:18.139> good<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.859> last<00:04:19.010> test<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.489> did

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
that's not very good the last test I did

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.520 
that's not very good the last test I did
was<00:04:19.849> look<00:04:20.090> for<00:04:20.150> banding<00:04:20.810> issues<00:04:21.169> like<00:04:21.380> you'd

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
was look for banding issues like you'd

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.500 
was look for banding issues like you'd
get<00:04:21.709> with<00:04:21.890> fluorescent<00:04:22.430> lights<00:04:22.640> but<00:04:23.240> I<00:04:23.330> went

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
get with fluorescent lights but I went

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.420 
get with fluorescent lights but I went
all<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.750> way<00:04:23.900> down<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.289> 30th<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.770> second<00:04:25.159> all

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
all the way down to 30th the second all

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.450 
all the way down to 30th the second all
the<00:04:25.520> way<00:04:25.580> up<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.940> 8

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the way up to 8

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.820 
the way up to 8
of<00:04:26.759> the<00:04:26.910> second<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.780> shudder<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.350> didn't

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
of the second on the shudder I didn't

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.710 
of the second on the shudder I didn't
see<00:04:28.949> any<00:04:29.070> banding<00:04:29.520> issues<00:04:29.820> which<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.509> a<00:04:30.539> good

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
see any banding issues which is a good

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.659 
see any banding issues which is a good
thing<00:04:30.900> given<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.680> cheap<00:04:31.949> construction<00:04:32.250> of

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
thing given the cheap construction of

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.730 
thing given the cheap construction of
both<00:04:32.820> of<00:04:33.030> these<00:04:33.150> lights<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.990> they<00:04:34.289> might<00:04:34.560> only

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
both of these lights and they might only

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.129 
both of these lights and they might only
last<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.250> few<00:04:35.280> years<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.729> constant<00:04:36.330> use<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.750> think

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
last a few years of constant use I think

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.990 
last a few years of constant use I think
the<00:04:37.440> clear<00:04:37.710> winner<00:04:37.949> here<00:04:38.039> is<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.729> canova

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
the clear winner here is the canova

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.760 
the clear winner here is the canova
because<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.690> light<00:04:39.870> panel<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.380> has<00:04:40.530> too

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
because the light panel just has too

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.950 
because the light panel just has too
many<00:04:40.889> circuitry<00:04:41.460> issues<00:04:41.820> that's<00:04:42.539> pretty<00:04:42.810> much

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
many circuitry issues that's pretty much

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.430 
many circuitry issues that's pretty much
it<00:04:43.169> I'll<00:04:43.350> talk<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.800> guys<00:04:43.830> later<00:04:43.949> bye
