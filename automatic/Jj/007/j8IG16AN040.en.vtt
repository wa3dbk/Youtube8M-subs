have your on/off switch this is it Nick
idea<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.720> turn<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.990> laser<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.620> off<00:02:25.710> let<00:02:26.400> me

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
idea to turn the laser on and off let me

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.250 
idea to turn the laser on and off let me
show<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.850> remote<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> box<00:02:27.960> here

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
show you the remote it's in the box here

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.550 
show you the remote it's in the box here
somewhere<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> brand<00:02:29.850> new<00:02:30.000> one<00:02:30.560> anyway

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
somewhere this is a brand new one anyway

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.320 
somewhere this is a brand new one anyway
it<00:02:31.620> does<00:02:31.800> come<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.220> wireless<00:02:32.490> remote<00:02:32.940> and

it does come with a wireless remote and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.860 
it does come with a wireless remote and
it's<00:02:33.780> radio<00:02:34.170> frequency<00:02:34.860> which<00:02:35.130> means<00:02:35.840> some<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's radio frequency which means some of

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.450 
it's radio frequency which means some of
the<00:02:36.960> lasers<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.800> like<00:02:37.980> right<00:02:38.430> in

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
the lasers you have to be like right in

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.610 
the lasers you have to be like right in
front<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.210> laser<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.230> anything<00:02:40.440> with

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
front of the laser to do anything with
