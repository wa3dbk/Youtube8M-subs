00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 4 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.390
 and how it starts 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.970
 the first thing for the people who are going to 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.970
 distribute 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
 so 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.300
 let's play 4 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.300
 yes 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.920
 four useful functions 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.610
 and ready 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.610
 missing close 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.020
 so now what do you have to do and what 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.430
 what are you going to distribute 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 the advantage of a city 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 and you put it 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.810
 you represent them with the creative ones 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810
 practices 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.100
 the unit 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240
 3 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.520
 life 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.520
 4 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.149
 maybe 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.070
 yes 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.070
 then 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 44 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560
 44 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 like once 48 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.319
 Now that this is done, a little bit of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.990
 ingenuity 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.650
 If you take the 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.180
 the matches with the biggest and that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 there are a thousand and now saying 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.870
 this rite deals with distributing 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.200
 you know 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 You can say wow 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.980
 these can be distributed equally 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.980
 in these moments 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.330
 because the red 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.110
 and so 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.780
 Yes Yes 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.540
 how 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.540
 Well, no 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.870
 so some scene 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.870
 nothing is left now 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.500
 there are four units left 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.480
 distribute the four units among all 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.220
 the participants here 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.670
 first you have to climb the southern territory 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.670
 and the green 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.430
 good and we missed something very important 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.430
 register our result 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.810
 we still would not have to heaven terry 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.889
 so many good results 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.889
 how many finals 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.300
 same 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.300
 single 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.060
 one 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.180
 or not 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.120
 those and those movies to orange let's start 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.810
 for these pearls these pearls that 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.810
 we make with the pearls 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.500
 we keep the software in tunisia 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.539
 that 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.380
 we work with these two before certain 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.940
 that's it 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.600
 if not 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.090
 do not 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.090
 tell me what can be 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.909
 we have only four units 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.060
 then how many times can we 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:46.160
 reverse none 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.160
 none is English 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.700
 then we register 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.090
 any imminent 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.550
 Y 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.340
 We return the carts the carts and 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.990
 as always they have two in two 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.249
 we do not follow 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.319
 there is no screw for her 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.319
 clear effect then 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.689
 what's up with these 4 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.229
 today you like it 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.229
 do not 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.419
 you can not continue distributing in a way 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.419
 equitable then 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:54.299
 and this saturates loose 10 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.010
 how
