00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
doing it that way and so I've actually

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.030 
doing it that way and so I've actually
been<00:02:27.780> watching<00:02:28.200> he<00:02:28.290> shared<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> couple<00:02:28.680> raids

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
been watching he shared a couple raids

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.210 
been watching he shared a couple raids

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and I've been watching him and I think

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160 
and I've been watching him and I think
once<00:02:32.400> i<00:02:32.490> get<00:02:32.670> my<00:02:32.700> balloons<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.300> level<00:02:33.630> 5<00:02:33.870> i'm

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
once i get my balloons to level 5 i'm

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.870 
once i get my balloons to level 5 i'm
probably<00:02:34.410> going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> start<00:02:35.220> trying<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.730> do

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
probably going to start trying to do

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.830 
probably going to start trying to do
this<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.210> well<00:02:37.190> because<00:02:38.300> dragons<00:02:39.300> are<00:02:39.630> fun<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
this as well because dragons are fun and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.960 
this as well because dragons are fun and
all<00:02:40.080> but<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:42.060> pretty<00:02:42.570> hard<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.790> do

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
all but it's it's pretty hard to to do

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.810 
all but it's it's pretty hard to to do
much<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:45.390> dragons<00:02:45.810> except<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.580> go<00:02:47.580> after

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
much with dragons except for go after

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.090 
much with dragons except for go after

with his balloon Ian if you have if you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.720 
with his balloon Ian if you have if you
find<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.440> town<00:02:52.620> hall<00:02:52.770> tin<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.280> pick<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.490> town

find a town hall tin you can pick a town
hall<00:02:53.880> tin<00:02:54.090> apart<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.600> pretty<00:02:55.430> pretty

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
hall tin apart like this pretty pretty

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.110 
hall tin apart like this pretty pretty
easily<00:02:56.700> well<00:02:57.630> not<00:02:57.750> easily<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.560> know

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
easily well not easily but you know

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.280 
easily well not easily but you know
relatively<00:03:00.120> well<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.390> guess<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.900> would<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
relatively well I guess you would be the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.290 
relatively well I guess you would be the
better<00:03:01.860> way<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.070> phrase<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:06.120> can

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
better way to phrase that and you can

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.440 
better way to phrase that and you can
get<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> fifty<00:03:06.810> percent<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> Town<00:03:07.590> Hall<00:03:07.620> 10

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
get a fifty percent on the Town Hall 10

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.240 
get a fifty percent on the Town Hall 10

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
and of course he dropped he uses macs

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.800 
and of course he dropped he uses macs
balloons<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.670> his<00:03:11.790> clan<00:03:12.000> castle<00:03:12.240> whenever<00:03:12.630> he

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
can and that helps him to pick up those

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.840 
can and that helps him to pick up those
extra<00:03:16.680> percentage<00:03:16.950> points<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.430> last<00:03:17.700> a

extra percentage points they last a
little<00:03:18.000> bit<00:03:18.120> longer<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.769> see<00:03:22.920> he

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
little bit longer but you can see he

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.430 
little bit longer but you can see he
think<00:03:23.250> he<00:03:23.340> got<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.150> there<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.450> he<00:03:24.510> already<00:03:25.260> had

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
think he got in there and he already had

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.320 
think he got in there and he already had
forty<00:03:25.709> six<00:03:25.920> percent<00:03:26.040> he<00:03:26.370> still<00:03:26.610> got<00:03:26.820> 10<00:03:27.000> mins

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
forty six percent he still got 10 mins

percent see the king he drops his King

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.830 
percent see the king he drops his King
sometimes<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.150> don't<00:05:35.570> think<00:05:35.660> it's

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
sometimes and I don't think it's

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.120 
sometimes and I don't think it's
necessary<00:05:36.290> for<00:05:36.320> him<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.530> drop<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.890> think<00:05:36.950> he

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
necessary for him to drop it I think he

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.560 
necessary for him to drop it I think he
just<00:05:37.160> goes<00:05:37.490> after<00:05:37.760> as<00:05:37.820> much<00:05:37.970> percentages<00:05:38.450> as

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
just goes after as much percentages as

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.920 
just goes after as much percentages as
you<00:05:38.630> can<00:05:39.490> sometimes<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.640> think<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.030> King<00:05:41.270> would

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
you can sometimes I think the King would

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.530 
you can sometimes I think the King would
be<00:05:42.110> better<00:05:42.260> served<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.680> take<00:05:42.890> out<00:05:43.040> some

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
be better served to take out some

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.820 
be better served to take out some
different<00:05:44.540> buildings<00:05:45.050> but<00:05:45.200> he<00:05:45.350> normally<00:05:45.710> uses

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
different buildings but he normally uses

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.320 
different buildings but he normally uses
him<00:05:46.010> at<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:46.190> end<00:05:46.280> of<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.430> raid<00:05:46.610> but<00:05:46.910> sometimes

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
him at the end of the raid but sometimes

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.460 
him at the end of the raid but sometimes
it<00:05:47.480> doesn't<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:48.230> not<00:05:48.320> necessary<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:49.040> do<00:05:49.160> that

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
it doesn't it's not necessary to do that

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.230 
it doesn't it's not necessary to do that
and<00:05:51.470> then<00:05:52.270> that's<00:05:53.270> pretty<00:05:53.570> much<00:05:53.780> all<00:05:55.240> from

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
and then that's pretty much all from

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.560 
and then that's pretty much all from
guru<00:05:56.690> here's<00:05:56.960> Macon<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:57.620> he's<00:05:58.430> got<00:05:58.730> did<00:05:59.450> he

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
guru here's Macon and he's got did he

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.660 
guru here's Macon and he's got did he
one<00:06:00.230> star<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.500> star<00:06:00.890> this<00:06:01.070> on<00:06:01.220> he<00:06:01.340> just<00:06:01.520> one

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
one star to star this on he just one

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.530 
one star to star this on he just one
started<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:02.150> it's<00:06:02.390> just<00:06:02.480> going<00:06:02.660> to<00:06:02.720> be<00:06:02.810> a<00:06:02.870> snipe

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
started so it's just going to be a snipe

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.460 
started so it's just going to be a snipe
so<00:06:05.540> yeah<00:06:05.690> that's<00:06:05.810> pretty<00:06:05.990> much<00:06:06.080> how<00:06:06.260> things

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
so yeah that's pretty much how things

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.670
