in the back behind this one this loop is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
from yesterday and then up to today c1

from yesterday and then up to today c1
start<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> form<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> Earth

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
start to form back here as the Earth

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.950 
start to form back here as the Earth
passes<00:00:49.530> between<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.250> satellite<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.750> Sun

passes between the satellite and the Sun

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
passes between the satellite and the Sun
I<00:00:52.230> guess<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> earth<00:00:53.039> I've<00:00:53.340> never<00:00:53.520> seen

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I guess that's the earth I've never seen

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.959 
I guess that's the earth I've never seen
it<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.930> acrobatics<00:00:55.680> quite<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.520> not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it do acrobatics quite like that not

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
it do acrobatics quite like that not
saying<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> earth<00:00:57.300> data<00:00:57.660> acrobatics<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.320> see

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
saying the earth data acrobatics but see

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.889 
saying the earth data acrobatics but see
how<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.710> horizontal<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.370> vertical<00:00:59.899> but

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
how it was horizontal and vertical but

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
how it was horizontal and vertical but
nevertheless<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:02.239> been<00:01:03.239> told<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.539> me<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
nevertheless it's been told to me that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500 
nevertheless it's been told to me that
that's<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> earth<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.210> guess<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that's the earth so I guess what it is

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.840 
that's the earth so I guess what it is
but<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.020> looking<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.850> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
but what are we looking at here this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.840 
but what are we looking at here this
round<00:01:09.299> sphere<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:12.799> there<00:01:13.799> goes<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.189> magnetic

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
round sphere right there goes a magnetic

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
round sphere right there goes a magnetic
filament<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:19.740> there

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
filament and then it's just right there

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.620 
filament and then it's just right there
it's<00:01:20.310> totally<00:01:20.610> obvious<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:21.150> gonna<00:01:21.299> put<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's totally obvious I'm gonna put the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's totally obvious I'm gonna put the
magnifier<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.560> please<00:01:22.680> bear<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.040> me

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
magnifier on it so please bear with me

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.440 
magnifier on it so please bear with me
this<00:01:23.490> greens<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.210> white<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.390> there<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
this greens gonna go white and there it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.280 
this greens gonna go white and there it
is<00:01:28.880> there's<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> plasma<00:01:30.509> vortex<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is there's the plasma vortex kind of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.550 
is there's the plasma vortex kind of
reminds<00:01:31.560> me<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> an<00:01:32.040> umbilical<00:01:32.400> cord<00:01:33.560> that's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
reminds me of an umbilical cord that's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.160 
reminds me of an umbilical cord that's
feeding<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.689> plasma<00:01:36.689> sphere<00:01:38.869> totally<00:01:39.869> new<00:01:40.020> one

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
feeding a plasma sphere totally new one

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
feeding a plasma sphere totally new one
to<00:01:40.229> me<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.189> very<00:01:41.460> interesting<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to me it's a very very interesting to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.990 
to me it's a very very interesting to
say<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> least<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.159> I'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.460> worth<00:01:44.729> keeping

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
say the least so I'll be worth keeping

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
say the least so I'll be worth keeping
an<00:01:45.240> eye<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.869> sure<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.560> we're

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
an eye on for sure I don't know if we're

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.090 
an eye on for sure I don't know if we're
witnessing<00:01:46.860> something<00:01:47.549> extraordinary<00:01:47.880> here

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
witnessing something extraordinary here

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
witnessing something extraordinary here
it<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> me<00:01:50.520> I've<00:01:51.270> never<00:01:51.540> seen<00:01:51.780> anything

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it is to me I've never seen anything

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.760 
it is to me I've never seen anything
like<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.549> that's<00:01:53.549> clearly<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.270> round<00:01:54.770> sphere

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
like that that's clearly a round sphere

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.569 
like that that's clearly a round sphere
that<00:01:56.040> has<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.640> sort<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> energy<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.600> its<00:01:57.750> own

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
that has some sort of energy of its own

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.030 
that has some sort of energy of its own
to<00:01:59.579> be<00:02:00.479> able<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.380> against<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> Sun

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
to be able to do that up against the Sun

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.399 
to be able to do that up against the Sun
and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.369> corona<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.299> also<00:02:03.479> visible<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:05.270> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
and the corona it's also visible on the

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.619 
and the corona it's also visible on the
Soho<00:02:07.409> space<00:02:07.770> craft<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.090> see<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> right

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
Soho space craft you can see it right

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.700 
Soho space craft you can see it right
down<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:10.289> gonna<00:02:10.410> put<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> magnifier<00:02:11.129> on

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
down here I'm gonna put the magnifier on

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.590 
down here I'm gonna put the magnifier on
time<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.380> see<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.620> down<00:02:14.740> there<00:02:14.950> too<00:02:15.600> and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
time you can see it down there too and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.780 
time you can see it down there too and
this<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.930> through<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> different<00:02:17.440> filter<00:02:17.790> leave

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
don't know it's very very interesting

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.990 
don't know it's very very interesting
almost<00:02:50.440> looks<00:02:50.710> like<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.130> sun's<00:02:51.370> given<00:02:51.790> birth

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
almost looks like the sun's given birth

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.260 
almost looks like the sun's given birth
to<00:02:52.270> up<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.630> up<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.380> planet<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:54.820> not<00:02:55.000> saying

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
to up to up to a planet I'm not saying

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.870 
to up to up to a planet I'm not saying
it's<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.600> planet<00:02:55.990> yet<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.340> got<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.670> start

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
it's a planet yet but it's got to start

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.710 
it's a planet yet but it's got to start
somehow<00:02:58.330> starts<00:02:58.870> out<00:02:59.020> as<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> sphere<00:02:59.770> and<00:02:59.950> then

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
somehow starts out as a sphere and then

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.810 
somehow starts out as a sphere and then
you<00:03:01.720> know<00:03:01.870> she<00:03:02.650> releases<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.280> umbilical<00:03:03.790> cord

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
you know she releases the umbilical cord

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.770 
you know she releases the umbilical cord
and<00:03:04.390> way<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.320> goes<00:03:05.560> starts<00:03:06.460> collecting<00:03:06.790> cosmic

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
and way it goes starts collecting cosmic

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.000 
and way it goes starts collecting cosmic
dust<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:09.690> many<00:03:10.690> years<00:03:10.750> later<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.890> have

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
dust and a many years later you you have

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.320 
dust and a many years later you you have
a<00:03:12.100> planet<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.970> theory

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
a planet it's just a theory

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.270 
a planet it's just a theory
I<00:03:13.480> don't<00:03:13.810> know<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.230> that's<00:03:15.100> quite
