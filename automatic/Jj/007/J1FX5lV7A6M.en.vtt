00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.980
 today show the results of fitting 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.519
 rear axle with car wheels 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.730
 matiz 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.269
 Well you can see vskidku what a venture 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.400
 succeeded 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.400
 that is, briefly recall the essence of the beam 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.039
 back axle to the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.260
 finalized to establish on it 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.830
 brake drums 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.780
 4 hairpin and matiz car wheels 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.230
 Well, for this flange rear beam 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.739
 bridge reworked here is the essence of alteration 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.050
 how it all happened was shown in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.960
 previous videos but now i 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.829
 demonstrate how the suspension works 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.829
 the car 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:11.899
 Well that is all there is nothing unusual 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.130
 ordinary now look at 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.130
 car rear view 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.890
 here you can see fresh white springs 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.590
 stand on a dirty rusty old back 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.600
 bridge but nothing over time i 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.450
 handle the rear axle everything will be 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:50.500
 ok now let's go watch right 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:50.500
 side well here 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:59.420
 right rear wheel of a car here 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.630
 everything is about the same as the left well 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.039
 about the same gaps 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.080
 so that means once again that here 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.959
 worth the drive 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.890
 four stud sizes in 13 tire 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:21.819
 pathetic gislaved 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.599
 165 to 70 r13 bast shoes are quite wide 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.989
 even in the Matiz these bastards touch for 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:34.370
 kit although there is more voluminous wheel 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:39.709
 Arch's well seen that it is quite 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.290
 It looks good gaps that to the right of that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:48.409
 on the left about the same well in every 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:52.450
 case and offhand and measurements 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.450
 I'll show you how the suspension works. 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.650
 Well, that's about as things stand 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:18.139
 today's moment as a bonus 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.819
 I suggest to look at the rear suspension 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:27.909
 right wheel is this mother Yezovsky 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:30.799
 4-month drum here it is spinning 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.549
 quite noisy we will see because 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.900
 bearings are old here it is not very 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.840
 clearly visible means the rear axle beam 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.449
 new factory spring new factory 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.379
 shock absorber 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.469
 chipper 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.000
 Well, that's actually all of us here 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.919
 small novelty 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.090
 and now I do not manually hook the nuts 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.090
 only by tool 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.699
 Well, that's really nothing but nice 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.810
 all well, now everything is exactly
