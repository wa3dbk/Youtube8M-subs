these<00:01:19.170> values<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.460> probably<00:01:20.850> because

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
these values but that's probably because

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.620 
these values but that's probably because
I'm<00:01:21.360> using<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.490> custom<00:01:23.490> character<00:01:24.150> creation

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I'm using a custom character creation

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990

screen<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> course<00:01:25.979> everyone<00:01:26.580> uses

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
screen which of course everyone uses

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.380 
screen which of course everyone uses
these<00:01:27.150> days<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.590> why<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.979> doing<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
these days so that's why it's doing this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.850 
these days so that's why it's doing this
but<00:01:30.390> regardless<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but regardless here we go we can go to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130 
but regardless here we go we can go to
hair<00:01:32.189> course<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.939> normal<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.630> choose

whatever haircut we want which is a

whatever haircut we want which is a
million<00:01:37.560> times<00:01:37.799> better<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.000> opinion

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
million times better in my opinion

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.960 
million times better in my opinion
because<00:01:39.900> why<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.280> lot<00:01:41.460> friends<00:01:41.820> list
