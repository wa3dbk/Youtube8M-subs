00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
wanting to do is is follow the concepts
so<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.990> want<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> remove<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:39.450> skin<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so you want to remove the skin from the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850 
so you want to remove the skin from the
outside<00:01:41.750> now<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> question<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.500> becomes

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
outside now the question then becomes

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.060 
outside now the question then becomes
now<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.579> I've<00:01:44.670> removed<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.509> skin<00:01:46.040> I'm<00:01:47.040> not

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
now that I've removed the skin I'm not

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.340 
now that I've removed the skin I'm not
going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.840> let<00:01:48.840> me<00:01:48.869> show<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.229> what

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
going to do with it let me show you what

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
going to do with it let me show you what
you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> skin<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.600> now

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you can do with all of the skin so now

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.289 
you can do with all of the skin so now
I've<00:01:51.869> removed<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.380> skin<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> inside

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I've removed the skin now on the inside

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.959 
I've removed the skin now on the inside
is<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> nice<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.409> fat<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is a nice little bit of fat to do it to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.370 
is a nice little bit of fat to do it to
skin<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:57.869> hand<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
skin is when you put your hand on the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.730 
skin is when you put your hand on the
grill<00:01:58.710> lay<00:01:59.520> with<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> skin<00:02:00.090> side<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
grill lay with the skin side down then

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
grill lay with the skin side down then
place<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> ham<00:02:02.369> right<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.759> top<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
place the ham right on top of it that

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.959 
place the ham right on top of it that
way<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> hand<00:02:04.680> gets<00:02:04.860> soaked<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.790> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
way the hand gets soaked and all of that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.609 
way the hand gets soaked and all of that
fat<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.509> keeps<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> ham<00:02:07.020> from<00:02:07.229> actually

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
fat it keeps the ham from actually

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.160 
fat it keeps the ham from actually
sticking<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> grate<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.899> little

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sticking to the grate and this little

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.110 
sticking to the grate and this little
piece<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.500> ham<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.910> missing

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
piece of ham right here that's missing

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.410 
piece of ham right here that's missing
on<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> fat<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> best

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
on the fat is the best

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.660 
on the fat is the best
part<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.930> whole<00:02:14.080> entire<00:02:14.349> thing<00:02:14.610> now<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
part of the whole entire thing now you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.040 
part of the whole entire thing now you
can<00:02:15.970> take<00:02:16.060> your<00:02:16.180> ham<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.630> can<00:02:16.690> put<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.020> right

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
can take your ham you can put it right

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.030 
can take your ham you can put it right
on<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> grill<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.250> cook<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:20.040> another

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
on the grill and you can cook it another

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.830 
on the grill and you can cook it another
little<00:02:21.280> tip<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.760> use<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.330> give<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.630> ham

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
little tip that I use to give the ham

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.470 
little tip that I use to give the ham
kind<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.440> old-school<00:02:24.280> look<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
kind of that old-school look the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
kind of that old-school look the
old-world<00:02:25.840> look<00:02:26.349> like<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.860> maybe<00:02:27.010> grandma

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
old-world look like it maybe grandma

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.040 
old-world look like it maybe grandma
used<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.849> make<00:02:27.910> her<00:02:28.150> ham<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.720> give<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.989> a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
used to make her ham is to give it a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.410 
used to make her ham is to give it a
crosshatch<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.819> way<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> give<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.360> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
crosshatch the way I give it a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.690 
crosshatch the way I give it a
crosshatch<00:02:31.900> take<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> nice<00:02:32.560> sharp<00:02:32.980> knife<00:02:33.130> and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
crosshatch take a nice sharp knife and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.580 
crosshatch take a nice sharp knife and
this<00:02:34.540> start<00:02:34.900> making<00:02:35.590> some<00:02:35.739> cuts<00:02:37.410> parallel<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
this start making some cuts parallel to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.720 
this start making some cuts parallel to
each<00:02:38.770> other<00:02:40.019> all<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.050> way<00:02:41.830> around<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:44.730> start

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
each other all the way around I start

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.160 
each other all the way around I start
from<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.910> top<00:02:45.940> here<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:46.630> span<00:02:46.900> down

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
from the top here and just span down

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.110 
from the top here and just span down
trying<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.010> cut<00:02:48.250> about<00:02:48.370> an<00:02:48.610> eighth<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.060> a
