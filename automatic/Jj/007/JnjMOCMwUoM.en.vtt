tree people just don't seem to know how

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.999 
tree people just don't seem to know how
to<00:00:10.410> properly<00:00:10.769> mulch<00:00:11.519> their<00:00:11.820> trees<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:13.740> in

the in the effort to make their trees
better<00:00:17.779> they're<00:00:18.779> ending<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.260> actually<00:00:19.680> making

known<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.720> volcano<00:00:25.199> mulching<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> tree

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
known as volcano mulching you see a tree

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.750 
known as volcano mulching you see a tree
with<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.420> big<00:00:27.689> mound<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.740> volcano<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.519> mulch

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
with a big mound or volcano of mulch

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.049 
with a big mound or volcano of mulch
around<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.179> base<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.369> now<00:00:32.369> volcano

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.870 
around the base of it now volcano
mulching<00:00:33.630> causes<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.860> bark<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> tree<00:00:35.730> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
mulching causes the bark of the tree to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.450 
mulching causes the bark of the tree to
be<00:00:36.000> wet<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> time<00:00:36.920> when<00:00:37.920> things<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.309> wet

be wet all the time when things are wet
all<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.570> disease

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
all the time they can get disease

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
all the time they can get disease
volcano<00:00:41.579> mulching<00:00:42.090> also<00:00:42.750> causes<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.010> roots

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
volcano mulching also causes the roots

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.190 
volcano mulching also causes the roots
of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> tree<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.969> grow<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.329> into<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.840> mulch

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
of the tree to grow up into this mulch

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.700 
of the tree to grow up into this mulch
and<00:00:47.329> by<00:00:48.329> being<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.960> mulch<00:00:49.260> over<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and by being up in this mulch over the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.340 
and by being up in this mulch over the
summer<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.219> things<00:00:50.460> dry<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:52.020> tree<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
summer when things dry out the tree is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
summer when things dry out the tree is
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> dry<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.800> rather<00:00:53.370> than<00:00:53.579> sending<00:00:53.910> its

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
going to dry out rather than sending its

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
going to dry out rather than sending its
roots<00:00:54.270> deep<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> soil<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> find

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
roots deep into the soil to find

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.880 
roots deep into the soil to find
moisture<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.730> shallow<00:00:57.090> roots<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
moisture they're all shallow roots and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.380 
moisture they're all shallow roots and
then<00:00:58.890> also<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> you'll<00:01:00.239> get

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
then also what you can get is you'll get

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
then also what you can get is you'll get
rodents<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> mulch<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.489> rodents

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
rodents in this mulch and the rodents

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
rodents in this mulch and the rodents
will<00:01:03.000> start<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.449> chew<00:01:04.260> away<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.830> bark<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
will start to chew away at the bark of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.929 
will start to chew away at the bark of
the<00:01:05.250> tree<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.770> out<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.189> nature<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the tree if you go out into nature and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.600 
the tree if you go out into nature and
walk<00:01:09.900> through<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> forest<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
walk through the forest you're going to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
walk through the forest you're going to
see<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> trees<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> have

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
see that all the trees are going to have

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
see that all the trees are going to have
a<00:01:13.200> nice<00:01:13.470> flare<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.189> call<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> root<00:01:14.790> flare

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
a nice flare we call it the root flare

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.200 
a nice flare we call it the root flare
at<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.780> base<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> tree<00:01:16.700> trees<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:18.000> go

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
at the base of the tree trees don't go

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.749 
at the base of the tree trees don't go
into<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> ground<00:01:18.750> straight<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> down

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
into the ground straight up and down

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
into the ground straight up and down
usually<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.060> you're<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.560> home<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> see

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
usually if you're in a home and you see

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
usually if you're in a home and you see
a<00:01:23.130> tree<00:01:23.400> straight<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.090> down<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:25.020> because

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
a tree straight up and down it's because

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.950 
a tree straight up and down it's because
somebody<00:01:25.799> did<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.189> filling<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.659> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
somebody did some filling around the you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.010 
somebody did some filling around the you
know<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> degree<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.280> build<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> house

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
know the degree to to build the house

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
know the degree to to build the house
but<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> woods<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.189> trees<00:01:32.850> are

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
but out in the woods all the trees are

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
but out in the woods all the trees are
going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> flare<00:01:33.720> because<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
going to have a flare because that's the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
going to have a flare because that's the
way<00:01:34.590> they're<00:01:34.770> meant<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> grow<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.280> you've

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
way they're meant to grow so if you've

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.380 
way they're meant to grow so if you've
got<00:01:40.310> volcano<00:01:41.310> mulching<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:41.909> property

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
got volcano mulching on your property

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.389 
got volcano mulching on your property
the<00:01:42.509> best<00:01:42.689> thing<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.250> go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the best thing you can do is just go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.600 
the best thing you can do is just go
ahead<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.850> peel<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> off<00:01:45.390> very<00:01:45.869> carefully

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
ahead and peel it off very carefully

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
ahead and peel it off very carefully
without<00:01:47.610> damaging<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> bark<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> tree<00:01:49.290> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
without damaging the bark of the tree so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
without damaging the bark of the tree so
we're<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> shovel<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.750> but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
we're going to use a shovel out here but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.780 
we're going to use a shovel out here but
once<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.710> near<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> bark<00:01:53.250> we're<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
once we get near the bark we're going to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.499 
once we get near the bark we're going to
just<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.060> our<00:01:54.210> hands<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.720> peel<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> away<00:01:56.509> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
just use our hands to peel that away so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.179 
just use our hands to peel that away so
all<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.049> mulch<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.759> just<00:01:59.759> excess<00:02:00.360> mulch<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
all this mulch is just excess mulch that

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.359 
all this mulch is just excess mulch that
was<00:02:02.189> dumped<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.850> poor<00:02:03.119> tree<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:05.189> can

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
was dumped on this poor tree and you can

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.240 
was dumped on this poor tree and you can
see<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:05.909> digging<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.360> here

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.510 

these<00:02:10.119> are<00:02:10.330> all<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.720> roots<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.200> tree<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
these are all the roots of the tree the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.870 
these are all the roots of the tree the
mulch<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.880> kind<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.180> sticking<00:02:13.510> together<00:02:17.880> but

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
mulch is kind of sticking together but

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.670 
mulch is kind of sticking together but
you<00:02:19.030> can<00:02:19.180> also<00:02:19.360> see<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.170> mulch<00:02:20.500> is

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
you can also see how this mulch is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100 
you can also see how this mulch is
extremely<00:02:21.220> dry<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.720> funny<00:02:22.960> I've

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
extremely dry and it's funny I've

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.410 
extremely dry and it's funny I've
actually<00:02:23.320> got<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.800> history<00:02:24.400> I've<00:02:24.640> got

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
actually got like a history I've got

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.210 
actually got like a history I've got
like<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> history<00:02:26.050> like<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.470> geology<00:02:26.770> there's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
like a history like in geology there's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.190 
like a history like in geology there's
the<00:02:27.310> layers<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> see<00:02:28.780> there<00:02:28.930> was<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.050> little

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the layers so I see there was a little

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.930 
the layers so I see there was a little
bit<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.470> red<00:02:29.620> mulch<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.100> at<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.550> point<00:02:30.580> they

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
bit of red mulch so at one point they

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.300 
bit of red mulch so at one point they
went<00:02:31.150> with<00:02:31.330> some<00:02:31.480> red<00:02:31.660> mulch<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.310> then

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
went with some red mulch and then

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.720 
went with some red mulch and then
there's<00:02:33.550> some<00:02:33.700> brown<00:02:33.940> too<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.580> how

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
there's some brown too but you see how

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.550 
there's some brown too but you see how
all<00:02:36.940> these<00:02:37.120> roots<00:02:37.420> are<00:02:37.570> up<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.960> soil<00:02:38.170> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
all these roots are up in the soil and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.170 
all these roots are up in the soil and
as<00:02:38.800> soon<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.190> gets<00:02:39.370> dry<00:02:39.610> these<00:02:39.670> roots<00:02:40.060> are

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
as soon as it gets dry these roots are

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.949 
as soon as it gets dry these roots are
going<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.330> dry<00:02:40.570> out<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> we're<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.630> going<00:02:46.900> to

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
going to dry out so we're just going to

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.860 
going to dry out so we're just going to
come<00:02:47.200> through

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.520 

and<00:02:53.160> clean<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:57.900> I'm<00:02:58.900> glad<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.379> got

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
and clean this up and I'm glad we got

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.640 
and clean this up and I'm glad we got
here<00:02:59.739> early<00:03:00.099> before<00:03:00.959> most<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.140> damage<00:03:02.500> was

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
here early before most the damage was

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.910 
here early before most the damage was
done

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
done

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.589 
done
so<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> see<00:03:03.550> here<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.879> here's<00:03:04.239> some<00:03:04.420> bigger

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
so you see here is here's some bigger

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.020 
so you see here is here's some bigger
roots<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.099> is<00:03:06.280> really<00:03:06.550> where<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.730> grade

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
roots so this is really where the grade

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.660 
roots so this is really where the grade
should<00:03:07.239> be<00:03:07.390> around<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.840> tree<00:03:08.400> now<00:03:09.400> around

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
should be around this tree now around

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.380 
should be around this tree now around
the<00:03:09.849> tree<00:03:10.150> we're<00:03:10.660> going<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> use<00:03:11.019> our<00:03:11.170> hands<00:03:11.530> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the tree we're going to use our hands to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.940 
the tree we're going to use our hands to
pull<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.540> mulch<00:03:13.810> away<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:17.410> don't<00:03:17.620> want<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.860> go

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
pull this mulch away we don't want to go

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.559 
pull this mulch away we don't want to go
damaging<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.580> bark<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:24.299> these<00:03:25.299> roots

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
damaging the bark and these roots

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.589 
damaging the bark and these roots
they're<00:03:25.930> growing<00:03:26.290> up<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.360> take<00:03:28.540> a

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
they're growing up and if you take a

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.030 
they're growing up and if you take a
look<00:03:28.840> here<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:29.290> don't<00:03:29.410> know<00:03:29.560> how<00:03:29.680> well<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:29.950> can

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
look here I don't know how well you can

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.030 
look here I don't know how well you can
see<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.260> going<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.470> become<00:03:32.620> what's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
see it this is going to become what's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.620 
see it this is going to become what's
known<00:03:33.099> as<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.400> girdling<00:03:33.880> root<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.299> root<00:03:34.329> is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
known as a girdling root the root is

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.479 
known as a girdling root the root is
actually<00:03:34.780> circled<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.440> tree<00:03:38.099> so<00:03:39.099> in<00:03:39.280> maybe

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
actually circled the tree so in maybe

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.430 
actually circled the tree so in maybe
ten<00:03:39.819> maybe<00:03:40.030> fifteen<00:03:40.540> years<00:03:40.569> this<00:03:41.079> root<00:03:41.319> will

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
ten maybe fifteen years this root will

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.170 
ten maybe fifteen years this root will
be<00:03:41.530> big<00:03:41.709> enough<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.129> is<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> tree<00:03:42.579> expanded

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
be big enough that is the tree expanded

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.199 
be big enough that is the tree expanded
its<00:03:43.329> growth<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:44.709> root<00:03:44.950> right<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.250> would

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
its growth this root right here would

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.940 
its growth this root right here would
actually<00:03:46.599> end<00:03:46.720> up<00:03:46.810> girdling<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.620> choking

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
actually end up girdling it and choking

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.309 
actually end up girdling it and choking
the<00:03:48.010> tree<00:03:48.250> out<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.650> we're<00:03:50.829> getting<00:03:52.319> we're

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
the tree out so we're getting we're

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.839 
the tree out so we're getting we're
getting<00:03:53.349> this<00:03:53.739> mulch<00:03:54.010> pulled<00:03:54.340> away<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.790> I

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
getting this mulch pulled away and I

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.580 
getting this mulch pulled away and I
just<00:03:55.030> feel<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.239> much<00:03:55.690> better<00:03:55.959> for<00:03:56.170> this<00:03:56.290> tree

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
just feel so much better for this tree

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.440 
just feel so much better for this tree
already<00:03:59.160> and<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.519> want<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.880> be<00:04:00.970> careful<00:04:01.359> I<00:04:01.420> don't

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
already and I want to be careful I don't

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.309 
already and I want to be careful I don't
want<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.810> use<00:04:01.900> any<00:04:02.109> sharp<00:04:02.590> metal<00:04:02.889> tools<00:04:04.319> when

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
want to use any sharp metal tools when

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:13.870 
want to use any sharp metal tools when
I'm<00:04:05.440> digging<00:04:05.769> around<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:06.130> base<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.609> tree

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.880 

and<00:04:14.330> any<00:04:14.690> thicker<00:04:15.050> roots<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.560> end<00:04:15.740> up

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
and any thicker roots you end up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.680 
and any thicker roots you end up
exposing<00:04:16.280> cut<00:04:16.760> them<00:04:16.880> nice<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.060> clean<00:04:17.390> they'll

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
exposing cut them nice and clean they'll

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.740 
exposing cut them nice and clean they'll
heal<00:04:17.870> over<00:04:18.140> much<00:04:18.350> quicker<00:04:18.590> much<00:04:18.950> better<00:04:19.750> so

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
heal over much quicker much better so

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.780 
heal over much quicker much better so
there<00:04:20.900> was<00:04:21.020> really<00:04:21.230> no<00:04:21.530> reason<00:04:21.560> whatsoever<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
there was really no reason whatsoever to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.660 
there was really no reason whatsoever to
have<00:04:22.970> this<00:04:23.150> extra<00:04:23.570> six<00:04:23.840> inches<00:04:24.170> of<00:04:24.350> mulch

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
have this extra six inches of mulch

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.820 
have this extra six inches of mulch
sitting<00:04:25.670> on<00:04:25.820> top<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.090> this<00:04:26.330> poor<00:04:26.570> tree<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.230> I'm

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
sitting on top of this poor tree and I'm

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.220 
sitting on top of this poor tree and I'm
happy<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.160> say<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.490> don't<00:04:28.790> see<00:04:28.940> any<00:04:29.090> signs<00:04:29.990> of

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
happy to say I don't see any signs of

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.360 
happy to say I don't see any signs of
damage<00:04:30.410> from<00:04:30.800> creatures<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:33.010> don't<00:04:34.010> see<00:04:34.190> any

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
damage from creatures I don't see any

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.370 
damage from creatures I don't see any
rot<00:04:34.700> so<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:35.570> think<00:04:35.690> we<00:04:35.960> got<00:04:36.140> it<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.410> time<00:04:38.380> it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
rot so I think we got it in time it

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.230 
rot so I think we got it in time it
looks<00:04:39.680> like<00:04:39.890> this<00:04:40.040> tree<00:04:40.340> was<00:04:40.520> still<00:04:40.760> planted<00:04:41.210> a

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
looks like this tree was still planted a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.820 
looks like this tree was still planted a
little<00:04:41.330> bit<00:04:41.480> too<00:04:41.660> deeply<00:04:42.110> because<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.710> way

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
little bit too deeply because of the way

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.060 
little bit too deeply because of the way
trees<00:04:43.160> are<00:04:43.340> dug<00:04:43.490> mechanically<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.300> nurseries

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
trees are dug mechanically and nurseries

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.210 
trees are dug mechanically and nurseries
sometimes<00:04:46.070> are<00:04:46.250> already<00:04:46.550> buried<00:04:46.940> too<00:04:47.120> deeply

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
sometimes are already buried too deeply

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.040 
sometimes are already buried too deeply
because<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.640> way<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:50.000> Machine<00:04:50.600> digs<00:04:50.900> them

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
because of the way the Machine digs them

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.930 
because of the way the Machine digs them
out<00:04:51.170> and<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.440> way<00:04:51.560> they're<00:04:51.710> cultivated<00:04:52.370> so

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
out and the way they're cultivated so

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.240 
out and the way they're cultivated so
whenever<00:04:53.120> you're<00:04:53.450> planting<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.960> new<00:04:53.990> tree<00:04:54.250> you

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
whenever you're planting a new tree you

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.080 
whenever you're planting a new tree you
really<00:04:55.610> want<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:57.190> scrape<00:04:58.190> off<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.490> top<00:04:58.670> of<00:04:59.000> the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
really want to scrape off the top of the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.520 
really want to scrape off the top of the
ball<00:04:59.240> very<00:04:59.570> carefully<00:04:59.990> like<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.230> did<00:05:00.380> here

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
ball very carefully like I did here

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.740 
ball very carefully like I did here
today<00:05:00.710> until<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.790> come<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.240> flair<00:05:02.600> of

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
today until you come to the flair of

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.870 
today until you come to the flair of
that<00:05:02.870> tree<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:03.380> make<00:05:04.190> sure<00:05:04.400> when<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.640> plant

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
that tree and make sure when you plant

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.070 
that tree and make sure when you plant
the<00:05:05.030> Flair<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.450> tree<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.780> got<00:05:05.930> that

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
the Flair of that tree you got that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.860 
the Flair of that tree you got that
flare<00:05:06.380> at<00:05:06.680> ground<00:05:07.250> level<00:05:07.370> or<00:05:08.210> sometimes<00:05:08.690> I'll

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
flare at ground level or sometimes I'll

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.330 
flare at ground level or sometimes I'll
put<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.140> flare<00:05:09.350> just<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.680> touch<00:05:09.860> higher<00:05:10.070> than

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
put the flare just a touch higher than

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.770 
put the flare just a touch higher than
ground<00:05:10.490> level<00:05:10.910> because<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.480> know<00:05:11.540> there's

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
ground level because I know there's

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.320 
ground level because I know there's
going<00:05:11.870> to<00:05:11.930> be<00:05:11.990> mulch<00:05:12.200> around<00:05:12.350> there<00:05:12.650> anyways

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
going to be mulch around there anyways

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.610 
going to be mulch around there anyways
so<00:05:14.330> we've<00:05:14.480> got<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.840> base<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.230> this<00:05:15.320> tree

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
so we've got the base of this tree

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.350 
so we've got the base of this tree
cleaned<00:05:15.920> up<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.430> can<00:05:16.700> see<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.240> I've

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
cleaned up and you can see that I've

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.740 
cleaned up and you can see that I've
lowered<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.840> grip<00:05:18.970> that's<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.150> good<00:05:20.330> six<00:05:20.660> to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
lowered the grip that's a good six to

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.280 
lowered the grip that's a good six to
seven<00:05:21.200> inches<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:23.300> just<00:05:23.570> hurts<00:05:23.840> me<00:05:24.020> every

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
seven inches and it just hurts me every

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.350 
seven inches and it just hurts me every
time<00:05:24.470> I<00:05:24.530> Drive<00:05:24.890> by<00:05:24.950> houses<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:25.910> see<00:05:26.120> this

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
time I Drive by houses and I see this

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.930 
time I Drive by houses and I see this
this<00:05:27.290> volcano<00:05:27.710> mulching<00:05:28.250> around<00:05:28.310> trees<00:05:28.760> and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
this volcano mulching around trees and

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.880 
this volcano mulching around trees and
shrubs<00:05:29.210> because<00:05:29.990> well<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.350> doesn't<00:05:30.530> do<00:05:30.740> any

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
shrubs because well it doesn't do any

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.460 
shrubs because well it doesn't do any
short-term<00:05:31.280> damage<00:05:31.970> long-term<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:33.170> know<00:05:33.230> it's

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
short-term damage long-term I know it's

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.660 
short-term damage long-term I know it's
going<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.650> affect<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.010> health<00:05:34.160> of<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> tree

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
going to affect the health of the tree

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.580 
going to affect the health of the tree
and<00:05:35.240> what<00:05:35.420> I'm<00:05:35.510> going<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:35.690> do<00:05:35.870> here<00:05:36.230> is<00:05:36.320> I'll<00:05:36.440> go

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
base of the tree

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.650 
base of the tree
go<00:05:39.950> ahead<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.310> re<00:05:40.430> mulch<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:41.060> I'll<00:05:41.480> leave<00:05:41.630> a
