screen sharing device for lumia devices

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.709 
screen sharing device for lumia devices
this<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.889> basically<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.340> miracast<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.360> with

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
this is basically a miracast on the with

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.560 
this is basically a miracast on the with
NFC<00:00:13.710> coaster<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.280> top<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.420> basically

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
NFC coaster on top so this is basically

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.840 
NFC coaster on top so this is basically
the<00:00:15.870> device<00:00:16.230> let's<00:00:16.590> take<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> quick<00:00:17.369> hardware

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the device let's take a quick hardware

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
the device let's take a quick hardware
walkthrough<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.539> very<00:00:19.400> minimalistic

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
walkthrough of it very minimalistic

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.179 
walkthrough of it very minimalistic
looking<00:00:20.880> device<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.390> mean<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.660> much<00:00:22.560> there<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
looking device I mean not much there you

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.939 
looking device I mean not much there you
know<00:00:23.310> Mike<00:00:23.490> miracast<00:00:24.240> dongle<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.109> anyway<00:00:25.560> you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
know Mike miracast dongle so anyway you

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.759 
know Mike miracast dongle so anyway you
got<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.189> LED<00:00:26.699> light<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.140> status<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
got a LED light for what the status of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
got a LED light for what the status of
the<00:00:29.070> device<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.750> currently

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the device is so this is currently

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
the device is so this is currently
powered<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.099> micro<00:00:32.460> USB<00:00:32.790> connection

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
powered on with the micro USB connection

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
powered on with the micro USB connection
that<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.530> micro<00:00:34.890> USB

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that we have here so this micro USB

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.479 
that we have here so this micro USB
connection<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> USB<00:00:37.770> source<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
connection can be from a USB source or a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
connection can be from a USB source or a
power<00:00:38.730> source<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> hdmi

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
power source and then you have the hdmi

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.250 
power source and then you have the hdmi
which<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> obviously<00:00:41.910> needed<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.780> output

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
which is obviously needed to output

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
which is obviously needed to output
whatever<00:00:43.829> comes<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.700> storm<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.149> do

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
whatever comes to this storm will do

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
whatever comes to this storm will do
your<00:00:45.570> TV<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:45.930> any<00:00:46.289> other<00:00:46.530> HDMI<00:00:47.160> monitor<00:00:47.360> so

that's<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> screen<00:00:49.469> sharing<00:00:49.680> device<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that's the screen sharing device in in a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
that's the screen sharing device in in a
nutshell<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.680> also<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> magnetic

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
nutshell so there is also the magnetic

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
nutshell so there is also the magnetic
coaster<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> attaches<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.370> top

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
coaster that attaches to it over the top

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.930 
coaster that attaches to it over the top
it's<00:00:57.180> basically<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.530> quick<00:00:59.190> shortcut<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's basically just a quick shortcut to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.720 
it's basically just a quick shortcut to
the<00:00:59.969> project<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.539> screen<00:01:00.930> app<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.070> Windows

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the project my screen app on the Windows

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.810 
the project my screen app on the Windows
Phone<00:01:02.969> device<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.870> 8.1<00:01:04.619> broad<00:01:04.920> support<00:01:05.159> for

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
Phone device so 8.1 broad support for

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
Phone device so 8.1 broad support for
miracast<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> tap<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.549> just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
miracast and when you tap it it just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060 
miracast and when you tap it it just
goes<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> project<00:01:09.780> my<00:01:09.900> screen<00:01:10.260> app<00:01:10.470> which

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
goes to the project my screen app which

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.910 
goes to the project my screen app which
then<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.729> use<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.479> quickly<00:01:12.689> connect<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
then you can use to quickly connect to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.090 
then you can use to quickly connect to
the<00:01:14.070> miracast<00:01:15.000> dongle<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.830> currently

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the miracast dongle so it's currently

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890 
the miracast dongle so it's currently
disconnecting<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.060> sure<00:01:18.270> why<00:01:18.479> but

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
disconnecting and not sure why but

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.460 
disconnecting and not sure why but
that's<00:01:19.350> how<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.650> easily<00:01:20.250> connect<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:21.119> the

that's how you easily connect with the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
that's how you easily connect with the
project<00:01:22.470> project<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> Americas<00:01:24.299> dongle

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
project project or the Americas dongle

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
project project or the Americas dongle
you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> actually<00:01:25.290> pass<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.979> around<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.490> if

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it and go to the project my screen thing

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.550 
it and go to the project my screen thing
and<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.560> hit<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.259> sort<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.380> an
