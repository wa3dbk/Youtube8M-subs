the new model the toilet separates the
ones<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:55.020> these

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
ones into is to make these

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
ones into is to make these
transformations<00:00:55.860> easier<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.550> will

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
transformations easier and it will

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
transformations easier and it will
include<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.000> handle<00:00:57.300> pump<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> operate<00:00:57.660> the

include a handle pump to operate the
pneumatic<00:00:58.379> tubes<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> lot<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> science

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
pneumatic tubes there's a lot of science

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.349 
pneumatic tubes there's a lot of science
involved<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.910> gets<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.149> bit

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
involved and it gets a little bit

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.880 
involved and it gets a little bit
confusing<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.840> overall<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.710> cool

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
confusing but overall it's really cool

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.080 
confusing but overall it's really cool
because<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.280> potentially<00:01:02.820> providing

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
because they are potentially providing

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.609 
because they are potentially providing

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
away for people all over the world to go

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.380 
away for people all over the world to go
to<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> bathroom<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.460> cleanliness<00:01:05.729> is

to the bathroom in a cleanliness is

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.609 
to the bathroom in a cleanliness is
something<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> people<00:01:07.350> take<00:01:07.500> for

the planet yeah and the fact of this
toilet<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.119> potentially<00:01:12.540> help<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.780> other

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
toilet could potentially help in other

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
toilet could potentially help in other
areas<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.530> energy<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.250> fertilization<00:01:14.670> and
