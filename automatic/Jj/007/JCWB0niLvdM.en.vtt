Ashwin<00:06:05.009> could<00:06:05.189> have<00:06:05.310> done<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.610> again<00:06:05.729> and<00:06:06.120> this

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
Ashwin could have done it again and this

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.850 
Ashwin could have done it again and this
time<00:06:06.300> he<00:06:06.870> would<00:06:07.139> have<00:06:07.259> had<00:06:07.409> to<00:06:07.529> have<00:06:07.650> gone<00:06:09.860> that

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
time he would have had to have gone that

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.850 
time he would have had to have gone that
was<00:06:11.159> even<00:06:11.729> after<00:06:12.419> that<00:06:12.599> incident<00:06:13.080> so<00:06:13.469> I<00:06:13.500> can't

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
was even after that incident so I can't

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.999 
was even after that incident so I can't
believe<00:06:14.539> what<00:06:15.539> Kilimani<00:06:16.259> is<00:06:16.560> actually

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
believe what Kilimani is actually

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.369 
believe what Kilimani is actually
thinking<00:06:17.399> about<00:06:17.550> if<00:06:18.210> he's<00:06:18.479> continued<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.139> do

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.379 
thinking about if he's continued to do

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.139 
thinking about if he's continued to do
it<00:06:19.409> which<00:06:19.680> he's<00:06:19.889> just<00:06:20.279> done<00:06:20.490> this<00:06:20.669> delivery

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:21.149 
it which he's just done this delivery

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:22.939 
it which he's just done this delivery
out<00:06:21.419> of<00:06:21.779> his<00:06:21.899> ground<00:06:22.199> before<00:06:22.349> the<00:06:22.620> ball<00:06:22.800> is

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
out of his ground before the ball is

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.769 
out of his ground before the ball is
released<00:06:23.099> he<00:06:23.909> deserves<00:06:24.300> to<00:06:24.419> be<00:06:24.569> run<00:06:24.750> out

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
released he deserves to be run out

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.860 
released he deserves to be run out
simple<00:06:25.710> as<00:06:25.800> that

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
simple as that

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.929 
simple as that
he<00:06:27.870> hasn't<00:06:28.169> even<00:06:28.529> let<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:29.099> ball<00:06:29.310> go<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.759> he's

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939 
he hasn't even let the ball go and he's

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:35.689 
he hasn't even let the ball go and he's
three<00:06:30.330> strides<00:06:30.719> down<00:06:31.139> the<00:06:31.649> pitch<00:06:34.009> what<00:06:35.009> is<00:06:35.219> he

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
three strides down the pitch what is he

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:36.230 
three strides down the pitch what is he
thinking

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
thinking

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.760 
thinking

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
tee Romani should learn

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.939
