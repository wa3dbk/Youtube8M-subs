00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 It's a proportional cock for the CIA some time 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.559
 I am sitting on the jetty that counts in Silvis 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.559
 The OGH has meanwhile become my home 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.200
 the wind farm is up to my ears but despite everything he can hear the sounds of the celebration 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 do not drown in the village 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.009
 the villagers see dancing dancing 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.169
 and also the fire that surrounded them, it is visible here 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.399
 After Music Watch Pain &amp; I announced today, force studies to deter it 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.070
 could 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 With the help of Beckmann can completely destroy organic eggs 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 Some people are celebrating in the game on 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.240
 there are not many who even if he knew all existence at all 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.100
 Actually we were like Park the only thing 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.900
 and we had to avoid trumpeting the news around you 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 thought of what a pranic would have triggered 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.840
 but many people still join us tonight 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.120
 partly because of the fact 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.450
 that the enmity between the Youth League is getting restive 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.500
 be settled 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 only here is not in the party to celebrate 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.070
 Of course, I am glad that this is generally new stairs and especially 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.870
 nice somebody could learn again francs 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.149
 anyway 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.490
 I just can not communicate 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.860
 I miss my luck 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 or rather someone 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.700
 I give my head and look at the sun on the horizon 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.810
 over the sea and Hecking 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.360
 a beautiful sight 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.469
 if I could wish for one Â«eat animalsÂ» 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.450
 that you put me here by my side and that is with me together 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.650
 is 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.700
 but slowly knows 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.270
 that these imagine could never become reality 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.730
 because you are 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.420
 I have the feeling that I should finally understand and process this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.910
 but I do not want it 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.270
 I do not want to pretend that I have never existed 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.720
 if i can not do it either 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.149
 but how should it continue now? 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.359
 the clue that the train brought my life as change and search for 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 to turn out to be wrong 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.399
 That we camouflaged him showed a person the round I did not give him 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.299
 clear 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.559
 Then I started to search my friend for her 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.109
 but then we learned that not only there to see but study 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.499
 after that, the events have turned over I did not have time 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.139
 had to think about it extensively 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.869
 but now I recognize 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.159
 do it quickly 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.309
 the one thing that has made me out of my lethargy 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.589
 tear out 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.179
 at this four by Dipl-ing 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.069
 I finally had a goal in front of my eyes 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.509
 finally a reason to get up and easy 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.219
 to live 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.079
 but now that I know that was a lie 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.429
 I do not know 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.519
 Does it make sense to go further? 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.479
 and if I have no clues 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.419
 "It may be better 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.489
 to follow up and try 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 easy to realize that they will never come back 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.290
 but how can i just go out 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.329
 search for them afterwards 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.329
 if I still love you so much 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:21.529
 but stop 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.849
 can not wait for a problem with the whole thing at St 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.729
 luckily I'm way too partial 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.719
 I still have feelings for you 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.089
 and maybe it's exactly these feelings that push me to it 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.789
 continue to search for the when my mind would actually say that 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.179
 that does not make sense 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.309
 but what should I do now 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.309
 It might be advisable to consult an old guard 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.509
 they are all my friends 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.409
 and if there are people who can not unconditionally trust, they are 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.529
 it 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.749
 maybe you know what to do 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.469
 my knees suddenly clear again how much my entire guard always me 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.909
 supported me and gave me advice 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.909
 without her, I would never have come this far 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.839
 and who knows 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.069
 maybe I will not even sit here anymore 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.579
 The wind continues to blow around me and messes up my hairstyle 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.570
 I realize how I get goose bumps and we unconsciously get the CENIT 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.870
 close to 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.130
 fastest I flipped my hands together around my hands 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.499
 Knee and protect me a little from the cold 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.050
 but basically I do not really care if I recognize myself or not 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.770
 Anyway, in the last few hours, I do not really care 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.559
 Everything I had been fighting for the last few weeks 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.169
 the study design 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.009
 and not everyone 1 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.969
 and he probably will not be back 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.389
 the more I think about it, the more logical it never seems 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.620
 because it would have had the opportunity to return 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.309
 he would not have done that long ago 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.309
 There is even a spark of hope KÃ¼nzer 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.229
 Can I just turn up somebody well then ever declined the decision 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.229
 whether I should continue searching for depth or not 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 unconsciously I bump into a big Goltz 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.709
 had
