00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello and welcome to my new 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.690
 video of loch every day in december 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 today I take you to my 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.699
 cooking where I'm going to make the recipe 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.380
 who bead and they close it are 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 German Christmas cupcakes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.189
 for example in Alsace in 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.430
 germany but also in austria you 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.430
 think 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.369
 these cupcakes is really married 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.020
 great with a little and afternoon 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.879
 to accompany your reading by 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.290
 example the proportions here allow 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.790
 to really do a lot but you 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.230
 can divide to make less 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:47.260
 obviously we will need 500 g 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:54.610
 flour 400 g butter 2 100 grams 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:57.699
 ground almonds 160 g sugar one 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.909
 teaspoon of vanilla liquid from 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.150
 vanilla sugar packet a pinch of 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.650
 salt then obviously the principle a little 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 the balls of this recipe is 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 that it must be really necessary 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.619
 to mix with the hands is hard enough 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.930
 it takes me like 20 minutes to the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.930
 do well because it takes the dough 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.420
 be well homogeneous so you put yourself 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 all loose in a salad bowl and after 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.549
 what to do 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.610
 so here it has to look like 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:02:00.110
 it's a very homogeneous dough all pretty 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:02.390
 like that in a ball is beautiful so after 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.390
 put a stretch film there to the plastic 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.770
 and then 30 minutes in the fridge you 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.020
 find with a pretty ford legs 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.480
 like that you have to spread it out you can 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.680
 use the cookie cutter I like 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.480
 because it makes small shapes 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.400
 Funny Stars of the Little Moons 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 rates like that but you can also 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.570
 make rolls of small sausages 15 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.120
 minutes in the oven and that's it 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.720
 beautiful is not it yes it's 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.880
 magnificent 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.410
 they are beautiful and cupcakes the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.390
 tradition wants us to leave it to the powders 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.060
 icing sugar 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.060
 but you can do no name to tomorrow
