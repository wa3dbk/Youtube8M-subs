what<00:01:10.400> looked<00:01:10.640> as<00:01:10.760> though<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:10.910> was<00:01:11.090> going<00:01:11.360> in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
what looked as though it was going in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.999 
what looked as though it was going in
but<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.780> keeper<00:01:12.050> had<00:01:12.140> other<00:01:12.320> ideas

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.300 

go

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.349 

well<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.430> he<00:01:22.490> going<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.700> be<00:01:22.759> up<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.090> task

well is he going to be up to the task
here<00:01:23.719> I'm<00:01:23.840> not<00:01:23.960> sure<00:01:26.020> when<00:01:27.020> he<00:01:27.140> reached<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.679> he

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
here I'm not sure when he reached it he

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.740 
here I'm not sure when he reached it he
thought<00:01:28.159> he<00:01:28.310> saved<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.850> when<00:01:29.240> he<00:01:29.299> got<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.450> strong

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
thought he saved it when he got a strong

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.510 
thought he saved it when he got a strong
enough<00:01:29.960> hand<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.439> think<00:01:30.590> he's<00:01:30.920> made<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.130> wicket

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520

there to the middle of the goal not
quite<00:01:38.840> sure<00:01:38.869> whether<00:01:39.319> he<00:01:39.469> meant<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:39.860> that<00:01:40.039> he's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130

quite sure whether he meant it that he's
done<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.399> job<00:01:40.429> not<00:01:41.149> today
