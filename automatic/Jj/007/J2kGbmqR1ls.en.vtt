00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
great-looking vehicle as well my

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.870 
great-looking vehicle as well my
downside<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.160> going<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.340> be<00:04:44.460> some<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.790> the

small<00:04:45.180> interior<00:04:45.510> material<00:04:46.169> choices<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.650> I

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
small interior material choices and I

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.400 
small interior material choices and I
think<00:04:46.919> are<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> little<00:04:47.280> bit<00:04:47.639> on<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:48.360> well<00:04:48.840> basic

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
think are a little bit on the well basic

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.409 
think are a little bit on the well basic
side<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:49.979> you<00:04:50.070> know<00:04:50.190> what<00:04:50.400> at<00:04:50.430> 30<00:04:50.820> grand<00:04:51.120> again

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419
