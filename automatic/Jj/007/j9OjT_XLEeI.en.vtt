00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
liftoff attack so we will use an arcane

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.249 
liftoff attack so we will use an arcane
blast<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:50.070> he<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.970> wishes<00:01:51.210> love<00:01:51.600> well

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
why not use an arcane blast and blast

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.850 
why not use an arcane blast and blast
him<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.420> then<00:01:57.719> use<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.380> light<00:01:58.590> attack

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
him and we will then use a light attack

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
him and we will then use a light attack
and<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> made<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> big<00:02:00.299> blunder<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.840> this

flesh and then my arcane or my flesh and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.490 
flesh and then my arcane or my flesh and
then<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.299> dog<00:02:06.450> attack<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> double

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
then my dog attack because the double

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
this is faster and he is going to burrow

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.070 
this is faster and he is going to burrow
more<00:03:06.010> unlikely<00:03:06.220> yep<00:03:07.090> he<00:03:07.330> burrows<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.690> I'm

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
more unlikely yep he burrows so I'm

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.390 
more unlikely yep he burrows so I'm
gonna<00:03:08.230> use<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> trouble<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:08.860> strike<00:03:09.100> then

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
gonna use a trouble that strike then

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.480 
gonna use a trouble that strike then
make<00:03:09.610> my<00:03:09.820> attacks<00:03:10.750> stronger<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.470> he's<00:03:12.280> going

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
make my attacks stronger and he's going

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.860 
make my attacks stronger and he's going
to<00:03:12.550> come<00:03:12.670> out<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.240> I'm<00:03:13.420> gonna<00:03:13.600> fuck

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
those two so we're probably gonna die

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.800 
well of course we're gonna die for
fuck's<00:03:43.780> sake<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:45.160> it's<00:03:45.430> all<00:03:45.610> up<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.540> flux

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
fuck's sake so it's all up to the flux

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.770 
fuck's sake so it's all up to the flux
fire<00:03:47.260> fucking<00:03:47.860> bunny<00:03:48.250> rabbit<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:48.790> her<00:03:48.910> kitten

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.170 
fire fucking bunny rabbit and her kitten
so<00:03:50.140> let's<00:03:50.590> see<00:03:50.800> if<00:03:51.040> we<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.489> beat<00:03:51.670> him<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:52.000> two

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
so let's see if we can beat him in two

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.580 
so let's see if we can beat him in two
turns<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:54.190> unlikely<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.140> we<00:03:56.140> might<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.440> able

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
turns it's unlikely but we might be able

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.340 
turns it's unlikely but we might be able
to<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.100> we<00:03:57.730> will<00:03:57.970> get<00:03:58.300> our<00:03:58.540> super<00:03:58.810> charge<00:03:59.170> on

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
to and we will get our super charge on

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.720 
to and we will get our super charge on
again<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.010> hopefully<00:04:00.459> he<00:04:00.850> uses<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.709> heal<00:04:02.730> would

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
again and hopefully he uses a heal would

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.270 
again and hopefully he uses a heal would
be<00:04:03.820> nice<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.989> we'll<00:04:05.530> use<00:04:05.739> our

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.630 

2,600<00:04:11.280> oh<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:12.090> do<00:04:12.360> love<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.930> attack<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:14.010> right

I<00:04:14.819> made<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> big<00:04:15.360> blunder<00:04:15.569> there<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.880> with<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
I made a big blunder there and with the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.340 
I made a big blunder there and with the
attack<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:19.250> my<00:04:20.250> wisp<00:04:21.169> shouldn't<00:04:22.169> have

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
attack of my wisp shouldn't have

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.350 
really think that you could take him out
using<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.409> level<00:05:58.620> 1<00:05:58.919> pet<00:05:59.159> you<00:05:59.580> know<00:05:59.699> the<00:06:00.240> way<00:06:00.330> I

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
using a level 1 pet you know the way I

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.500 
using a level 1 pet you know the way I
did<00:06:00.750> with<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.530> farmer<00:06:01.919> or<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.760> used<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.270> level

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
did with the farmer or I used the level

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.149 
did with the farmer or I used the level
1<00:06:03.659> pet<00:06:03.840> because<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.199> was<00:06:04.320> able<00:06:04.409> to<00:06:04.590> take<00:06:04.860> him<00:06:05.010> out

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
1 pet because I was able to take him out

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.909 
1 pet because I was able to take him out

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
with the one pet I definitely don't

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.230 
with the one pet I definitely don't
think<00:06:08.039> you'll<00:06:08.400> be<00:06:08.550> able<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:08.789> do<00:06:08.909> it<00:06:09.030> here

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
think you'll be able to do it here

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.100 
think you'll be able to do it here
especially<00:06:09.930> because<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:12.419> liftoff<00:06:12.810> and

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
especially because of the liftoff and

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.740 
especially because of the liftoff and
the<00:06:13.169> burrow<00:06:13.320> attacked<00:06:13.770> because<00:06:14.460> if<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.270> you

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
the burrow attacked because if you you

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.719 
the burrow attacked because if you you
get<00:06:15.900> hit<00:06:16.110> by<00:06:16.260> them<00:06:16.470> you're<00:06:17.070> pretty<00:06:17.280> much<00:06:17.430> dead

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
get hit by them you're pretty much dead

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.930 
get hit by them you're pretty much dead
anyway<00:06:18.210> so<00:06:19.219> you're<00:06:20.219> gonna<00:06:20.370> have<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.700> use<00:06:20.789> at

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
least two level 25

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.219

for<00:06:22.889> this<00:06:22.979> guy<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.430> think<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:24.810> might<00:06:24.990> be<00:06:25.020> able

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229
