00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.880
 hey people today stylish ashley benson 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.949
 or hannah of the pretty 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 little liars after and that's right 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.820
 stark look the picture you can find in 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.420
 the infobox and that's what I use 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.850
 me today 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.320
 I'll start an eyeshadow with it 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.300
 primer on my eyelids 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.300
 Apply and blend well 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.510
 Now I take a dark brown 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.250
 eyeshadow tone and wear it with one 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.440
 eyeshadow brush out of my whole 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.339
 movable lid and something in the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.339
 fold on 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.230
 with a light brown tone and a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:19.690
 I blended fluffy blender brush 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:22.180
 now the hard edges therefore the make up 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.890
 looks pretty reddish on the photo 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.080
 I take a rusty brown now 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.400
 eyeshadow tone and still blinded 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 times above my eyelet fold 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.479
 I associate the whole thing with me again 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.479
 paint my blender 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.850
 I wear my moving song 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.890
 now a black eyeshadow tone 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 on to the make up even more 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.280
 darken 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.280
 and here again I use it 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.280
 The transitions 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 on my upper and lower waterline 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 I generously wear a black one 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.010
 kajal on moreover at the bottom 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.010
 eyelash wreath 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 then I take one again 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.500
 very little blender brush the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.270
 Rusty brown clay on and off 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.870
 then I join the black again 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.870
 lower lash line 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.120
 very close to my upper lash line 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.400
 in the eyelashes I carry something else 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.050
 black eyeshadow on it there 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.050
 simply no bright gaps arise 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.860
 Wear this cream eyeshadow 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 I again directly under a 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.850
 eyebrow on so there just no 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.850
 hard transitions can be seen 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.480
 hannah is probably wearing the picture 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.099
 false eyelashes but I have to 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.269
 my eyelashes just decided 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.269
 very strong to deceive 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.019
 probably ashley benson is from 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.150
 nature rather brunette than blond 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.069
 that's why she has very dark eyebrows 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.810
 I try mine too, relatively strong 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.819
 but I wanted to go now 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.950
 not quite as dark eyebrows paint 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.950
 that he did something crass from 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.790
 in the photo she wears red rouge and 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.530
 red lipgloss and that's why I have 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.390
 that's exactly what I am doing 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.700
 had to improvise something because 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.650
 Unfortunately, I did not find my red 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.750
 yes and red lips together with the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.790
 I think smokie already something 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.709
 I would not be so violent in general 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.959
 wear but I really try that 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.030
 picture after picture and on the picture 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.030
 she wears red lips to smokey eyes 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.760
 Last but not least, I am still wearing one 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:40.350
 highlight on the highest point of my 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:42.300
 cheekbones on we go on with the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.550
 hair on the photos and also in general 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.320
 hannah wears her hair in the series 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.600
 whenever I or lured 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.670
 and always in a rather moderate way 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.590
 and here I take a streak 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.050
 for stranded and wrapped around you 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.060
 let curling iron of phillips do it 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.550
 but I always end up the left out so 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.230
 the curls or waves are not quite like that 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.460
 look awesome but more like this 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.320
 bit different 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.330
 and to add a little more to this look 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.040
 I change support by myself 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.290
 my hair sometimes to the face 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.060
 or to the face away that is 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.130
 either I put the curling iron in front of the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.020
 strand and here and then put the 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.910
 strict around it or I take that 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.740
 curl and hold him behind the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.460
 streak and then wrap my hair 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.560
 around 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.050
 This simply prevents the curls 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.640
 fall into each other and just like that 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.640
 look a bit mediocre 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.360
 Now I want to finger my 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.220
 just go through the hair with it 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.500
 Hair is a little loose and one 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.080
 look a bit more messi and now 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.820
 I take a volume brother from the taffeta 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.370
 and I'll give that to me then 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.770
 approach and then you can then the hair 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.660
 still a bit more voluminous 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.370
 that means you just rub it 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.350
 so all hurt that can see now and 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.250
 then the hair at the beginning is still something 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.250
 raised 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.740
 Finally, I fix my hair 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.960
 still with hairspray and knead something 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.850
 so that it still looks fluffy 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.280
 and then we would be done with 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.570
 this inspired look by hannah resp 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.570
 ashley benson 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.320
 so I hope you have been inspired 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.600
 look from hannah or ashley benson 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.340
 the series pretty little liars liked 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.199
 and I just like it too 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.090
 make up something stronger lux because 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.220
 I think that's cool, too, if you are 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.600
 then you want to see more star looks 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.250
 definitely gives the video one 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.110
 Thumb up and write me in the 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.699
 comments which is the next one 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.289
 times to steep 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.150
 and otherwise as always mean 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.139
 last two videos next to her linked 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.820
 and I wish you one more 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.660
 beautiful day and see you on 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.660
