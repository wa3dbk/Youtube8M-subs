48,000<00:02:47.680> people<00:02:48.040> which<00:02:48.220> i<00:02:48.370> think<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.640> pretty

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
48,000 people which i think is pretty

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.320 
48,000 people which i think is pretty
good<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.050> new<00:02:50.440> stadium<00:02:50.769> especially<00:02:51.730> since

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
good for a new stadium especially since

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.350 
good for a new stadium especially since
we<00:02:52.630> see<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.170> status<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.860> San<00:02:54.069> Siro<00:02:54.100> we<00:02:55.060> can

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
we see the status of the San Siro we can

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.560 
we see the status of the San Siro we can
fill<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:55.930> therefore<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:57.519> think<00:02:58.239> this<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.420> a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
fill it up therefore I think this is a

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.300 
fill it up therefore I think this is a
pretty<00:02:58.780> good<00:02:59.019> number<00:02:59.200> forty<00:02:59.739> eight<00:02:59.829> thousand

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
pretty good number forty eight thousand

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.150 
pretty good number forty eight thousand
just<00:03:00.820> about<00:03:01.030> 50,000<00:03:01.870> there<00:03:01.989> should<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.829> very

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
just about 50,000 there should be very

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.229 
just about 50,000 there should be very
good<00:03:03.390> for<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.540> new<00:03:04.750> stadium<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:06.280> some<00:03:07.090> other

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
stadium won't be more than 30 meters now

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.210 
stadium won't be more than 30 meters now
the<00:03:42.760> San<00:03:43.150> Siro<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.630> actually<00:03:44.049> 60<00:03:44.650> meters<00:03:45.010> so

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the San Siro is actually 60 meters so

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.800 
the San Siro is actually 60 meters so
it's<00:03:45.370> double<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.910> what<00:03:45.940> they're<00:03:46.209> planning<00:03:46.480> to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
it's double of what they're planning to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.740 
it's double of what they're planning to
make<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.549> also<00:03:48.790> due<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.420> new
