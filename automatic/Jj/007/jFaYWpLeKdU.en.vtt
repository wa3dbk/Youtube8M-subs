okay<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:00.870> here's<00:00:01.230> my<00:00:01.439> set<00:00:01.709> up<00:00:01.829> for<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay so here's my set up for the

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.760 
okay so here's my set up for the
automatic<00:00:02.460> watering<00:00:02.939> system<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.659> have<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> jug

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
automatic watering system I have a jug

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.680 
automatic watering system I have a jug
my<00:00:05.220> timer<00:00:06.379> the<00:00:07.379> water<00:00:07.649> pump<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.639> timer<00:00:09.300> only

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
my timer the water pump the timer only

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.110 
my timer the water pump the timer only
used<00:00:09.960> uses<00:00:10.679> two<00:00:10.889> prongs<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.490> plug<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.090> I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
used uses two prongs to plug in so I

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.370 
used uses two prongs to plug in so I
have<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> put<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> gap<00:00:12.750> driver<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
have to put in a gap driver for the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.090 
have to put in a gap driver for the
ground<00:00:13.650> wire<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> Rio<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.969> water<00:00:15.719> pump

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
ground wire for this Rio be water pump

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.859 
ground wire for this Rio be water pump
this<00:00:17.100> water<00:00:17.430> pump<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.029> actually<00:00:18.690> used<00:00:19.109> for

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
this water pump is actually used for

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.980 
this water pump is actually used for
cutting<00:00:23.029> tiles<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.210> stuff<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.660> they

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
cutting tiles and stuff like that they

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.589 
cutting tiles and stuff like that they
sell<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.320> home<00:00:25.529> depot<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.279> lowes<00:00:26.599> cost

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
sell that home depot and lowes cost

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.710 
sell that home depot and lowes cost
about<00:00:27.779> fifteen<00:00:28.199> dollars<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.689> is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
about fifteen dollars so what you do is

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.370 
about fifteen dollars so what you do is
you<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.679> stick<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.640> pump<00:00:33.450> into<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.170> water

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
you just stick the pump into your water

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.100 
you just stick the pump into your water
source<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.980> used<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.399> milk<00:00:35.640> jug<00:00:35.719> because<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.809> can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
source I used a milk jug because I can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.680 
source I used a milk jug because I can
find<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> large<00:00:37.829> bucket<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.090> would<00:00:39.239> probably<00:00:39.450> be

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
find a large bucket it would probably be

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
find a large bucket it would probably be
better<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> bucket<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
better with the bucket you want to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.810 
better with the bucket you want to
submerge<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.660> pump<00:00:43.040> into<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.579> water

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
submerge the the pump into your water

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.290 
submerge the the pump into your water
source<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> way<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:48.000> this

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
source all the way and then i have this

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200 
source all the way and then i have this
quarter<00:00:49.140> inch<00:00:49.379> tubing<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.610> connect<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
quarter inch tubing that connect to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
quarter inch tubing that connect to
where<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> water<00:00:52.170> pumps<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
where the water pumps out of so as you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.459 
where the water pumps out of so as you
can<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.039> fully<00:00:56.280> submerged<00:00:57.289> at<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
can see it's fully submerged at the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.090 
can see it's fully submerged at the
bottom<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.719> then<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> quarter

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
bottom there and then i have the quarter

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
bottom there and then i have the quarter
inch<00:01:02.219> tubing<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.879> how<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> tubing<00:01:03.449> goes<00:01:03.600> down

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
inch tubing see how the tubing goes down

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.620 
inch tubing see how the tubing goes down
to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> ground<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.860> makes<00:01:05.159> water<00:01:05.760> pump<00:01:06.150> real

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to the ground that makes water pump real

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
to the ground that makes water pump real
quick<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.770> picking<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> raising<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
quick so picking it up and raising and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.920 
quick so picking it up and raising and
this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> 2<00:01:10.770> 15<00:01:11.220> footers<00:01:11.729> coupled<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
this is a 2 15 footers coupled with a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
this is a 2 15 footers coupled with a
copper<00:01:14.479> coupler<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> total<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:18.000> 30

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
copper coupler this is so total about 30

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
copper coupler this is so total about 30
feet<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.840> tubing<00:01:19.880> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.119> raise<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
feet of tubing if you raise it up it the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.210 
feet of tubing if you raise it up it the
water<00:01:22.799> drain<00:01:23.479> pumps<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.720> slower<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> came

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
water drain pumps much slower so I came

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
water drain pumps much slower so I came
up<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.610> 30<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.229> timing

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
up with 30 because that was the timing

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.569 
up with 30 because that was the timing
that<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> needed<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.770> here's<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.009> timer<00:01:32.340> I'm

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that I needed so here's the timer I'm

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.100 
that I needed so here's the timer I'm
just<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.820> turn<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.329> instead<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.810> setting

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
just gonna turn on instead of setting

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
just gonna turn on instead of setting
the<00:01:34.200> time<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.619> had<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.490> function

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the time we had that on and all function

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.260 
the time we had that on and all function
so<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.900> gonna<00:01:36.990> turn<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
so I'm just gonna turn it on here and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.810 
so I'm just gonna turn it on here and
the<00:01:39.270> water<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.630> pumping<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.619> it'll<00:01:41.280> pump<00:01:41.549> all

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the water is pumping the it'll pump all

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.399 
the water is pumping the it'll pump all
the<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.119> through<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> again<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> move

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the way through and again if you move

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.399 
the way through and again if you move
and<00:01:44.220> elevate<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.759> tubing<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> slows<00:01:45.840> down<00:01:45.869> how

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and elevate the tubing it slows down how

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.520 
and elevate the tubing it slows down how
fast<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> water<00:01:47.070> pumps<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.290> now

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
fast the water pumps so as it is now

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.170 
fast the water pumps so as it is now
it's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.860> pumping<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.340> full<00:01:50.579> speed<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it's just pumping at full speed and I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's just pumping at full speed and I
have<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> sit<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.780> high<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> water<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
have a sit on high and see the water is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
have a sit on high and see the water is
just<00:01:53.280> coming<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.000> said<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> minute

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
just coming out I said it for a minute

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.030 
just coming out I said it for a minute
on<00:01:56.420> every<00:01:57.420> Saturday<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.200> every<00:01:58.500> Wednesday<00:01:59.009> to
