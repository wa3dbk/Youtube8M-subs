I'll just go onto a creative world on

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.600 
I'll just go onto a creative world on
the<00:02:27.630> seed<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.200> i<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.470> try<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.709> find<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:31.550> ok<00:02:32.550> so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the seed so i can try and find it ok so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.970 
the seed so i can try and find it ok so
i'm<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> creative<00:02:33.330> world<00:02:33.980> typical
