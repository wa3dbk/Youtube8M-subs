but<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.340> fine<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.210> just<00:02:27.450> do

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
but this is fine and then you just do

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.030 
but this is fine and then you just do
that<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.310> flip<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:29.970> over<00:02:30.620> no<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.650> get

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
that and you flip it over no you get

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.400 
that and you flip it over no you get
this

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
this

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.980 
this
and<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:36.030> sort<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.480> out<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.810> really

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
and you sort it out but this is really

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.840 
and you sort it out but this is really
creased<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> folds<00:02:40.980> are<00:02:41.070> coming<00:02:41.370> not<00:02:41.550> for

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
creased so the folds are coming not for

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.840 
creased so the folds are coming not for
me<00:02:41.940> I'm<00:02:42.510> their<00:02:42.840> new<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.350> bring<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> over<00:02:45.830> like

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
me I'm their new just bring it over like

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.420 
me I'm their new just bring it over like
that<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.830> sort<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:52.430> for

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that and then you sort it out and for

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.050 
that and then you sort it out and for
now<00:02:53.610> what<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.120> do<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.800> put<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.490> bit<00:02:56.820> is

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
now what you do is you put this bit is

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.180 
now what you do is you put this bit is
you<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.630> put<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.020> up<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.470> and<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:02.160> just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you do put it up like that and you just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.110 
you do put it up like that and you just
pin<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.990> but<00:03:03.990> don't<00:03:04.320> worry<00:03:04.470> about<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.670> showing

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
pin it but don't worry about it showing

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.600 
pin it but don't worry about it showing
through<00:03:06.810> anything<00:03:07.340> because<00:03:08.340> you're<00:03:08.489> gonna

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
through anything because you're gonna

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.970 
through anything because you're gonna
hide<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.560> but<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.800> bit<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.489> get<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.880> bit

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
hide it but this bit so you get this bit

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.320 
hide it but this bit so you get this bit
and<00:03:14.510> I'm<00:03:15.510> trying<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.840> figure<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.820> yeah<00:03:17.820> this

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
and I'm trying to figure out yeah this

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.240 
and I'm trying to figure out yeah this
bits<00:03:18.540> gonna<00:03:18.780> be<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.260> need<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:20.010> play

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
bits gonna be you need to just play

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.520 
bits gonna be you need to just play
around<00:03:20.489> with<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:20.970> get<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.270> right<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.500> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
around with it and get it right so that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.850 
around with it and get it right so that
this<00:03:23.489> side<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.209> longer<00:03:24.570> than<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.230> side<00:03:25.500> so

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
this side is longer than that side so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.650 
this side is longer than that side so
it's<00:03:26.010> like<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.320> then<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:29.160> get<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.660> fold

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
it's like that then you get that fold

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.080 
it's like that then you get that fold
fold<00:03:31.020> fold

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
fold fold

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.360 
fold fold
I'm<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.239> fold<00:03:33.600> like<00:03:33.930> gather<00:03:34.470> kind<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.160> thing

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
I'm not fold like gather kind of thing

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.500 
I'm not fold like gather kind of thing
then<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.300> bring<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.690> over<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.480> put

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
then you bring it over and you you put

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.360 
then you bring it over and you you put
it<00:03:39.870> really<00:03:40.470> wherever<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:41.250> want<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:43.370> had

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it really wherever you want to I had

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.010 
it really wherever you want to I had
mined<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.730> little<00:03:44.940> bit<00:03:45.060> more<00:03:45.209> diagonally<00:03:45.870> and

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
mined a little bit more diagonally and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.380 
mined a little bit more diagonally and
stuff<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.500> see<00:03:46.890> when<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.160> put<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.459> here<00:03:47.700> you

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
stuff and see when you put it here you

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.870 
stuff and see when you put it here you
hide<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.019> other<00:03:49.170> side<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.010> then<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.580> just

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
hide the other side and then you just

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.800 
hide the other side and then you just
get<00:03:51.840> your<00:03:52.019> PIN<00:03:53.090> I'm<00:03:54.090> using<00:03:57.019> one<00:03:58.019> up<00:03:59.239> then<00:04:00.239> you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
get your PIN I'm using one up then you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.490 
get your PIN I'm using one up then you
pin<00:04:01.110> it

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
pin it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.330 
pin it
and<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.460> a<00:04:03.490> little<00:04:03.850> tip<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:05.020> pin<00:04:05.530> one

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
and this is a little tip so you pin one

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.660 
and this is a little tip so you pin one
pin<00:04:06.730> like<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.280> see<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.380> put<00:04:11.740> pin<00:04:12.460> one

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
pin like can you see so you put pin one

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.240 
pin like can you see so you put pin one
pin<00:04:13.120> like<00:04:13.330> that<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.080> then<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:15.070> get<00:04:15.190> another

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
pin like that and then you get another

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.030 
pin like that and then you get another
pin<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.810> pin<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:17.109> like<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:19.709> if<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.890> get

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
pin and you pin it like that if you get

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.680 
pin and you pin it like that if you get
what<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.250> mean<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.760> hope<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.120> guys<00:04:22.270> get<00:04:22.480> what<00:04:22.660> I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
what I mean I hope you guys get what I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.630 
what I mean I hope you guys get what I
mean<00:04:22.810> let<00:04:23.140> me<00:04:23.170> show<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.500> I'll<00:04:24.040> do<00:04:24.430> like<00:04:24.580> a

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
mean let me show you I'll do like a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.450 
mean let me show you I'll do like a
little<00:04:25.000> demo<00:04:25.270> like<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.560> put<00:04:26.770> one<00:04:27.010> pin<00:04:27.220> like

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
little demo like you put one pin like

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.370 
little demo like you put one pin like
this<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.710> then<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:29.860> get<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.160> other<00:04:30.310> pin<00:04:30.640> and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
this and then you get the other pin and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.190 
this and then you get the other pin and
you<00:04:32.380> pin<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.890> like<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:34.090> if<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.690> do<00:04:34.930> that

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
you pin it like that and if you do that

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.400 
you pin it like that and if you do that
so<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:38.410> just<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:39.820> will<00:04:39.940> never<00:04:40.180> move<00:04:40.420> I've<00:04:41.170> been

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
so it just it will never move I've been

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.490 
so it just it will never move I've been
doing<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.280> it's<00:04:42.670> never<00:04:43.240> moved<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:44.320> make

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
doing it and it's never moved but make

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.400 
doing it and it's never moved but make
sure<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.800> use<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.040> kind<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.790> long<00:04:46.300> pin<00:04:46.600> or<00:04:46.900> you

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
sure you use a kind of a long pin or you

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.620 
sure you use a kind of a long pin or you
put<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:47.830> in<00:04:48.100> like<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.610> couple<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.120> times<00:04:49.390> because

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
put it in like a couple of times because

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.260 
put it in like a couple of times because
putting<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.230> in<00:04:50.350> once<00:04:50.740> is<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.610> enough<00:04:51.940> and

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
putting it in once is it enough and

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.050 
putting it in once is it enough and
using<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.690> long<00:04:52.900> pin<00:04:53.170> and<00:04:53.470> doing<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:53.980> like<00:04:54.790> a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
using a long pin and doing it like a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.120 
using a long pin and doing it like a
couple<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.450> times<00:04:55.630> it's<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.080> much<00:04:56.260> better<00:04:56.440> so

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
couple of times it's so much better so
