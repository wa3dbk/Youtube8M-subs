00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
some minor programs installed so there

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.200 
some minor programs installed so there
you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.630> it'll<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.200> earth<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.210> ROM

you know it'll be the earth at the ROM

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.709 
you know it'll be the earth at the ROM
or<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.840> bare<00:00:40.260> rom<00:00:40.910> in<00:00:41.910> order<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
or the bare rom in order to do this

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.819 
or the bare rom in order to do this
you'll<00:00:42.960> need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:44.450> recovery<00:00:45.450> image

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
you'll need to have a recovery image

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
you'll need to have a recovery image
flashed<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> there's<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.390> threads<00:00:50.840> about<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
flashed so there's some threads about it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
flashed so there's some threads about it
and<00:00:52.260> also<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.280> flash<00:00:53.550> new<00:00:53.820> modems<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and also you can flash new modems to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
and also you can flash new modems to
clockworkmod<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.520> other<00:00:56.670> thing

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
clockworkmod from here the other thing

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.590 
clockworkmod from here the other thing
only<00:00:57.000> download<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.550> format<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.730> for

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
only download is this format all for

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.469 
only download is this format all for
epic<00:01:00.870> touch<00:01:01.050> 4g<00:01:03.769> zip<00:01:04.769> file<00:01:05.060> which<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
epic touch 4g zip file which will be the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.399 
epic touch 4g zip file which will be the
first<00:01:06.659> step<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:08.490> assumes<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.390> video<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
first step so this assumes this video is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
first step so this assumes this video is
going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> assume<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.040> downloaded<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
going to assume that you downloaded the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to assume that you downloaded the
epic<00:01:12.540> touch<00:01:12.720> 4g<00:01:13.140> rom<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.830> bare<00:01:14.130> rom<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.960> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
epic touch 4g rom or bare rom and this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.590 
epic touch 4g rom or bare rom and this
format<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.860> every<00:01:17.340> touch<00:01:17.490> 4g<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> have

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
format all for every touch 4g and have

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.399 
format all for every touch 4g and have
also<00:01:18.869> installed<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:20.450> clockwork<00:01:21.450> mod<00:01:21.630> or<00:01:22.020> some

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
also installed a clockwork mod or some

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
also installed a clockwork mod or some
other<00:01:22.530> recovery<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> allows<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.900> flash

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
other recovery that allows you to flash

other recovery that allows you to flash
zip<00:01:24.930> files<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> we'll<00:01:26.970> move<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.299> from<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.780> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
zip files so we'll move on from here so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.609 
zip files so we'll move on from here so
here's<00:01:28.710> our<00:01:28.799> phone<00:01:30.049> in<00:01:31.049> order<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> boot<00:01:31.530> in

here's our phone in order to boot in

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
here's our phone in order to boot in
recovery<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.710> hold<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> power<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> the

flash this you'll end up with the rogue

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.640 
flash this you'll end up with the rogue
recovery<00:02:35.000> instead<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.380> know<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
recovery instead of the you know the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.250 
recovery instead of the you know the
standard<00:02:36.830> clockworkmod<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.600> here<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
standard clockworkmod so here we go the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.449 
standard clockworkmod so here we go the
rogue<00:02:39.710> epic<00:02:40.040> touch<00:02:40.250> recovery<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.310> we<00:02:43.430> go

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
rogue epic touch recovery and here we go
