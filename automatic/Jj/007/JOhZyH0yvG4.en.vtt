00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello dear friends with you on 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.670
 bond claudia root and here you see 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 such a mountain and reward is a grade of moldova 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.660
 in the market it is cheap here yesterday I bought 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.029
 10 kilogram now 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.529
 juice is made without 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:31.250
 pulp it in juice makers 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 we will wash the grapes from 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.579
 Georgia but I will show you a juice pot 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 bottom we pour filtered 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.950
 water here by mark then such a measure then 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 we put rays on it 2 part 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.079
 turn you on 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.329
 then we will lay out my grapes and here in 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.930
 such a grating capacity is 3 capacity 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.740
 separate in rose and 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.360
 from can of course la everyday with tassels 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:18.590
 well then take a lot of space 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:26.289
 and so here is our construction of the two we 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:36.110
 by our very third already our grapes and 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:40.970
 close tightly the lid we 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.880
 covered and that's how juice goes with us 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:49.270
 the pot here is a clamp so that the steam is not 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.170
 got out of here and the juice that comes in 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.869
 while softening the berries in this container 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.460
 spills over here and now we will start 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.579
 disassemble our design 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.430
 From the beginning we open the lid there we remove 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.369
 up there is quite a bit left 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.910
 see only put on than them left from 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.910
 grape 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:34.189
 further there we still have juice 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:38.180
 we pour it a lot more water 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:41.510
 and now we have rolled up our banks 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.849
 natural juice without preservatives without 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.389
 sugar is very useful to us in the winter 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.299
 the jars are very beautiful nice 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:57.010
 appetite and good luck to you 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.010
 it's a half liter dashed off
