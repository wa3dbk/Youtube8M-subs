keeping<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.250> bit<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.670> my<00:01:24.270> diet<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
keeping a little bit in my diet then it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.539 
keeping a little bit in my diet then it
won't<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.290> hard<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.650> reintroduce<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
won't be so hard to reintroduce more of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.020 
won't be so hard to reintroduce more of
it<00:01:26.640> later

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it later

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.590

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
vlogs with people who have stabilized

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.080 
vlogs with people who have stabilized
and<00:02:49.799> maintained<00:02:50.310> their<00:02:50.549> weight<00:02:50.700> loss<00:02:50.730> after

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
and maintained their weight loss after

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.089 
and maintained their weight loss after
HCG<00:02:51.630> that's<00:02:51.840> actually<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:52.530> most

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
HCG that's actually one of my most

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.819 
HCG that's actually one of my most
exciting<00:02:53.310> things<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.970> watch<00:02:54.239> on<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.959> and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
exciting things to watch on here so and

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.680 
exciting things to watch on here so and
she<00:02:55.980> has<00:02:56.099> done<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.459> after<00:02:56.880> both<00:02:57.180> rounds

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
she has done that after both rounds

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.970 
she has done that after both rounds
she's<00:02:57.870> stabilized<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.680> has<00:02:58.829> been

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
she's stabilized and has been

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.130 
she's stabilized and has been
maintaining<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:00.660> she<00:03:00.750> lost<00:03:00.930> her

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
maintaining so and I think she lost her

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.589 
maintaining so and I think she lost her
around<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.500> 30<00:03:02.190> 30<00:03:02.670> pounds<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.180> first<00:03:03.420> round

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
around like 30 30 pounds of first round

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.630 
around like 30 30 pounds of first round
and<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.019> 25<00:03:04.799> or<00:03:05.040> something<00:03:05.099> like<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.519> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and like 25 or something like that the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.130 
and like 25 or something like that the
second<00:03:05.910> round<00:03:06.030> she's<00:03:06.180> done<00:03:06.329> extremely<00:03:06.930> well

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
second round she's done extremely well

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.580 
second round she's done extremely well
so<00:03:07.950> anyway<00:03:08.370> HCG<00:03:08.970> mom<00:03:09.209> my<00:03:09.690> friend<00:03:10.019> go<00:03:10.260> check<00:03:10.470> her

um<00:04:48.270> it's<00:04:49.270> not<00:04:49.479> my<00:04:49.689> favorite<00:04:50.259> with<00:04:50.590> stevia<00:04:51.069> as

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
um it's not my favorite with stevia as

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.510 
um it's not my favorite with stevia as
the<00:04:51.430> sweetener<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.439> does<00:04:53.740> work<00:04:54.009> and<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.400> is

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
the sweetener but it does work and it is

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.070

a really good tea and I think with other

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.860 
a really good tea and I think with other
sweeteners<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.740> would<00:04:56.860> be<00:04:57.009> superb<00:04:57.699> so<00:04:58.300> that

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
sweeteners it would be superb so that

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.110 
sweeteners it would be superb so that
one<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.259> then<00:04:59.590> there's<00:04:59.740> just<00:04:59.919> two<00:05:00.129> more<00:05:00.279> from

shouldn't have more than one cup of this

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.469 
shouldn't have more than one cup of this
because<00:06:27.550> you<00:06:27.639> know<00:06:27.729> chocolate<00:06:27.969> does<00:06:28.300> have

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
because you know chocolate does have

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.260 
because you know chocolate does have
caffeine<00:06:28.870> as<00:06:29.050> well<00:06:29.229> and<00:06:29.560> maybe<00:06:30.460> I<00:06:30.729> had<00:06:31.240> a

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
caffeine as well and maybe I had a

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.700 
caffeine as well and maybe I had a
couple<00:06:31.509> cups<00:06:31.779> one<00:06:31.990> day<00:06:32.139> and<00:06:32.289> I<00:06:32.379> was<00:06:32.500> just<00:06:32.620> like

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
couple cups one day and I was just like

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.760 
couple cups one day and I was just like
whew<00:06:33.060> really<00:06:34.060> jittery<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:34.719> um<00:06:34.990> I<00:06:35.259> guess<00:06:35.500> that

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
whew really jittery so um I guess that

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.230 
whew really jittery so um I guess that
caffeine<00:06:36.310> does<00:06:36.520> add<00:06:36.639> up<00:06:36.669> it<00:06:36.880> doesn't<00:06:37.089> say<00:06:37.180> how
