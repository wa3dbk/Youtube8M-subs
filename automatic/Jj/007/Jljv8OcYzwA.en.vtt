00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
I'm using the vector which I really

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.069 
I'm using the vector which I really
hasn't<00:00:57.960> haven't<00:00:58.739> used<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> um<00:01:00.750> I'm

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
hasn't haven't used a lot of but um I'm

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.799 
hasn't haven't used a lot of but um I'm
starting<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> start<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.809> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
starting to start to like it and the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.780 
starting to start to like it and the
vector<00:01:04.019> silenced<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.770> fantastic

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
vector silenced is a very fantastic

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.539 
vector silenced is a very fantastic
weapon<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> try<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.340> said

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
weapon so I try to you know like i said

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.469 
weapon so I try to you know like i said
i<00:01:11.729> try<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> variety<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:17.310> guess<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
i try to use a variety and I I guess I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
i try to use a variety and I I guess I
don't<00:01:18.720> realize<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.409> can't<00:01:19.650> long<00:01:19.860> range

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
don't realize that you can't long range

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
don't realize that you can't long range
with<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.150> pretty<00:01:21.360> weak<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
with that it's pretty weak from that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.420 
with that it's pretty weak from that
distance<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.939> um<00:01:24.920> looks<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.100> i'm<00:01:26.220> just

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
distance and so um looks like i'm just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.340 
distance and so um looks like i'm just
trying<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.869> speedy<00:01:27.869> classes<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
trying to speedy classes a kind of the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
trying to speedy classes a kind of the
kind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> goal<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.799> match<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.720> spazz

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
kind of the goal in this match and spazz

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.249 
kind of the goal in this match and spazz
red<00:01:34.200> dot<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.939> you<00:01:35.939> won't<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.570> tell<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.140> i

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
have a red dot on my spazzes before i

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
have a red dot on my spazzes before i
even<00:01:39.329> got<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.720> grip<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.740> once<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.250> my

goes on it the spaz grip is pretty much

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.910 
goes on it the spaz grip is pretty much
just<00:01:49.680> amazing<00:01:50.250> i<00:01:50.490> am<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> fan<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:52.470> Last

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
Stand you bastard get that out of here

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
Stand you bastard get that out of here
so<00:01:58.229> um<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> fairly<00:01:59.219> decent<00:01:59.250> score<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so um I get a fairly decent score for a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
so um I get a fairly decent score for a
free-for-all<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.509> actually<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.020> right

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
free-for-all and actually I think right

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
free-for-all and actually I think right
there<00:02:02.250> was<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> majority<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:03.240> kills

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
there was like the majority of my kills

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.670 
there was like the majority of my kills
I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.719> died<00:02:04.009> twice<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:06.000> um<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> just

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
I think I died twice more but um so just

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.810 
I think I died twice more but um so just

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
he was but he was back there sitting and

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.450 
he was but he was back there sitting and
made<00:04:23.860> sure<00:04:23.949> that<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.220> killed<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.690> guy<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.460> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
made sure that I killed the guy and I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.280 
made sure that I killed the guy and I
didn't<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.940> wasn't<00:04:28.210> able<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.449> kill<00:04:28.660> my<00:04:28.870> teammate

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
didn't I wasn't able to kill my teammate

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.280 
didn't I wasn't able to kill my teammate
but<00:04:30.190> um<00:04:30.510> because<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.720> know<00:04:31.840> he<00:04:31.990> was<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.169> one

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
but um because you know he was the one

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.450 
but um because you know he was the one
boosting<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:33.790> we<00:04:34.120> still<00:04:34.979> were<00:04:35.979> managed<00:04:36.340> to

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
boosting but we still were managed to
