00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.990
 good i am quiksilver and today we are at 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.730
 I work in minecraft on the second map 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.169
 of the series quit mod that is going to be the 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.089
 map that we will use from 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:14.059
 now until good until I get another 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:17.420
 new that will be quite ahead of a 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.610
 Month Two Months do not know well the map 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.670
 called good maps created by quiksilver 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.539
 channel the map of the wilmot series 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.689
 ruined and my name is the street 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.509
 the name will generate randomly a little bit 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.629
 I know it occurred to me to destroy is already 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:40.670
 well the map let's see it now before 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:44.809
 not good now intro you see this 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.620
 and here I will put the episode number and 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:52.269
 good the sixth map this one you'll say good 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.370
 it's not good either 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.370
 mainly has this part of the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.539
 center here that for the tutorials already 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.580
 which is a broad clean part of stone 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.180
 in which you can do everything then 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 we have that part of there 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.610
 the little beach, so to speak, a little beach 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.930
 this would be like a kind of field 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.900
 then this does not make much sense 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.600
 but hey it 's here we can not create 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.300
 music while we record then 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.110
 We have the port with its respective 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.110
 part in case there is a boat mod then 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.940
 we have a part of height that would be the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.170
 the tower and finally we have this from 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.170
 here that if we enter 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 we go down 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.299
 We have export at birth and inc 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.570
 like the lit ones because if we give 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.570
 here 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.960
 and it is understood well this is a bit of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 but that 's better than giving him the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.350
 merit and I do not leave it activated already almost 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.810
 noises and pretty stripe 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.670
 good the new map where are you going to do in 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.619
 the cosmos here with this central part 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.590
 where we are going to give almost always here and 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.930
 doing the little things and a little more 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.140
 decoration a better world made better 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.610
 defined with more little things then we have 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.069
 for x normal part of the world itself 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.260
 you have to look for minerals or something 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.500
 and it's a map that I'll leave in the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.800
 description so you can download it 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.470
 as you already know 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.850
 within a month to and I'll get another one 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.540
 map and send me those and I like what 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.180
 I will use and well nothing we are going to 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.820
