evolution like happen and this is
basically<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> cheating<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> not

really<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> cheating<00:00:50.789> method<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.899> because

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
really a cheating method just because

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
really a cheating method just because
with<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> fourth<00:00:52.649> gen<00:00:52.890> games<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:54.000> cannot

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
with the fourth gen games you cannot

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.250 
with the fourth gen games you cannot
trade<00:00:55.039> to<00:00:56.039> each<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.180> decimate<00:00:57.930> even

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
trade to each game on decimate even

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.299 
trade to each game on decimate even
through<00:00:58.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:59.100> um<00:00:59.460> decimating<00:01:00.680> 0.97<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
through Wi-Fi on um decimating 0.97 the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
through Wi-Fi on um decimating 0.97 the
older<00:01:02.579> version<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> allows<00:01:03.480> Wi-Fi<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
older version that allows Wi-Fi you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
older version that allows Wi-Fi you
can't<00:01:04.619> even<00:01:04.680> trade<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> through<00:01:05.280> Wi-Fi<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
can't even trade it through Wi-Fi so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
can't even trade it through Wi-Fi so
it's<00:01:06.330> nearly<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.990> pot<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.380> impossible

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's nearly in pot it's impossible

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.609 
it's nearly in pot it's impossible
nearly<00:01:08.640> impossible<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.180> unless<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.320> do

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
nearly impossible actually unless you do

some codec things and stuff and Bob and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.810 
some codec things and stuff and Bob and
um<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.880> trade<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.820> I'm

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

it<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.780> pops<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.740> because

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it just pops up as that just because

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.999 
it just pops up as that just because
it's<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.600> hacking<00:02:03.600> device<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.320> cheating<00:02:04.770> device

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it's a hacking device or cheating device

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
it's a hacking device or cheating device
and<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> hit

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and so with that I'm just going to hit

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.889 
and so with that I'm just going to hit

playing down in a pearl and so let's see

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.660 
playing down in a pearl and so let's see
electro<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.380> right<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.190> we're<00:02:32.490> going<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
electro is right here so we're going to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.490 
electro is right here so we're going to
go<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> party<00:02:33.240> at<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.630> we're<00:02:34.050> gonna<00:02:34.170> edit

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
go to party at it and we're gonna edit

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.850 
go to party at it and we're gonna edit
electro<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.110> all<00:02:37.110> we're<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> do<00:02:37.650> is

we're<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.160> change<00:02:38.400> magnet<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.180> into

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
we're going to change magnet on into

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.350 
we're going to change magnet on into
magnezone<00:02:40.470> that's<00:02:41.190> all<00:02:41.550> we<00:02:41.820> have<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.180> now

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
magnezone that's all we have to do now

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.760 
magnezone that's all we have to do now
you<00:02:42.390> see<00:02:42.720> there's<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.080> bunch<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.380> stuff<00:02:43.470> here

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
you see there's a bunch of stuff here

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.650 
you see there's a bunch of stuff here
that<00:02:43.800> allows<00:02:44.310> me<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.610> change<00:02:44.760> stats<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.540> it's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that allows me to change stats and it's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.350 
that allows me to change stats and it's
move<00:02:45.870> set<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.260> whatever<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:48.210> do

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360

him to Magnezone now all I'm going to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.850 
him to Magnezone now all I'm going to
hit<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.340> OK<00:02:57.410> save<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.210> exile<00:03:00.210> if<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.410> open<00:03:01.800> up

hit is OK save and exile if you open up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.070 
hit is OK save and exile if you open up
the<00:03:02.010> emulator<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.850> easy<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.960> to

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the emulator it's that easy just to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.070 
the emulator it's that easy just to
evolve<00:03:04.350> him<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.790> already<00:03:05.940> tested<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.840> out

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
evolve him and I already tested this out

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.410 
evolve him and I already tested this out
with<00:03:07.410> my<00:03:07.530> souls<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:08.010> my<00:03:08.160> heart<00:03:08.370> gold<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:09.150> on

with my souls on my heart gold for on
first<00:03:10.200> sight<00:03:10.500> there<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.580> nest<00:03:12.510> like<00:03:12.660> that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
first sight there and to nest like that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.790 
first sight there and to nest like that
to<00:03:13.230> us

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
to us

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.920 
to us
yeah<00:03:14.100> site<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:14.460> into<00:03:14.640> scissor<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
yeah site there into scissor and so it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.450 
yeah site there into scissor and so it
worked<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.320> we<00:03:16.470> perfectly<00:03:17.190> fine

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
worked for if we perfectly fine

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.670 
worked for if we perfectly fine
hopefully<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.120> does<00:03:18.330> too<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.440> check

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
hopefully this does too and if you check

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.040 
hopefully this does too and if you check

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
you see we have a Magnezone so looks

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.390 
you see we have a Magnezone so looks
like<00:03:26.520> we<00:03:26.820> finally<00:03:27.300> have<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> Magnezone<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.220> our

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
like we finally have a Magnezone on our

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.030 
like we finally have a Magnezone on our
team<00:03:29.640> obviously<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.390> Dex<00:03:30.720> number<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.260> past

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
team obviously it's Dex number is past

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.860 
team obviously it's Dex number is past
being<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> national<00:03:32.880> dex<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.240> can<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.570> enjoyed

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
being the national dex it can be enjoyed

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.420 
being the national dex it can be enjoyed
Oh<00:03:33.930> Dex<00:03:34.200> since<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.500> can't<00:03:34.740> really<00:03:34.920> evolve<00:03:35.250> it

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
Oh Dex since you can't really evolve it

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.020 
Oh Dex since you can't really evolve it
yet<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.810> there<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.500> go<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:37.980> see<00:03:38.459> we

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
yet but there you go as you see we

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.170 
yet but there you go as you see we
finally<00:03:39.330> have<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.990> Magnezone<00:03:40.860> after<00:03:41.760> all<00:03:41.940> this

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
finally have a Magnezone after all this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.250 
finally have a Magnezone after all this
time<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.860> did<00:03:44.220> was<00:03:44.670> raise<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.209> stats<00:03:45.540> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
time and all I did was raise it stats to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960 
time and all I did was raise it stats to
how<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:46.620> supposed<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.250> actually<00:03:47.700> didn't
