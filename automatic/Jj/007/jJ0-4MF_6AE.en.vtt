00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
w13 because we still don't know too much

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.369 
w13 because we still don't know too much
about<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.480> other<00:00:06.810> than<00:00:06.899> there<00:00:07.200> would<00:00:07.319> be

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
about it other than there would be

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.280

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
updated features and the lights but

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.080 
updated features and the lights but
there's<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.559> thing<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.740> grinded<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.550> gears

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
there's one thing that grinded my gears

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.620 
there's one thing that grinded my gears
in<00:00:12.690> w12<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.860> was<00:00:14.009> interfering<00:00:15.000> because

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
in w12 and that was interfering because

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.760 
in w12 and that was interfering because
interviewing<00:00:16.410> WB<00:00:16.710> 12<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.330> annoyingly<00:00:18.330> bad<00:00:19.320> in

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
interviewing WB 12 was annoyingly bad in

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
interviewing WB 12 was annoyingly bad in
the<00:00:19.980> sense<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:21.180> could<00:00:21.359> only<00:00:21.510> attack

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the sense that you could only attack

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
the sense that you could only attack
them<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> beginning<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> match<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.670> was

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
them at the beginning of a match it was

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.060 
them at the beginning of a match it was
the<00:00:23.850> same<00:00:24.150> cutscene<00:00:24.689> animation<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.740> couldn't

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the same cutscene animation you couldn't

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070 
the same cutscene animation you couldn't
really<00:00:26.250> use<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:26.789> weapons<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.750> under<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
really use any weapons from under the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.750 
really use any weapons from under the
hood<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.560> don't<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.250> only<00:00:29.519> had<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
hood so you don't really only had the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120 
hood so you don't really only had the
steps<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> ring<00:00:30.420> bell<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.009> go

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
steps in the ring bell so here we go

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
steps in the ring bell so here we go
there's<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> same<00:00:32.610> animation<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.239> saw<00:00:33.390> every
