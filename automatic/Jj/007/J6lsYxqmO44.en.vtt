00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.570
 Hello 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.990
 you know what is this are some sprouts 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 of alfalfa that are beautiful and very easy 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:25.000
 to do what he taught everything here you see 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.630
 these are alfalfa seeds we have it 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.079
 in a house and so you can see how it's done 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.719
 this is the end, but we can no longer 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.329
 eat but you can even see all that are missing 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.329
 you no longer eat where you are taking each 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:47.470
 day a little bit and they go van van 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:51.130
 growing every morning and every night 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.590
 without without even this stage 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.210
 I water them because they are plants that 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.340
 they need water for fish 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 and simply the second 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.860
 and I overturn it because because if I leave it with 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 water gets 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.700
 and then I have there as a grid 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.069
 but good is anything that does not 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.579
 cover these holes we can no longer 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:22.039
 leave it on one at a table because if not 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.650
 would love would stagnate and that water would 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.050
 I know that you start asking for the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.420
 free 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.240
 and that's it and this every morning and every 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.730
 night and if you forget one day it does not happen 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.450
 nothing as if one day we do not eat 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:43.840
 personal but already two or three now not 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.840
 I want a few to eat lame 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.179
 with these 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.360
 how are you going to eat 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.680
 and I wash them well 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.450
 I like to get rid of a little bit of what 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.030
 would be the remains of seed of the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.440
 remains of shell 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.440
 I put in a colander 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.170
 the last pass 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.830
 and I'm already ready to eat 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.050
 like these that I have done a 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.840
 now and they are precious to serve 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.640
 the dishes 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 also that it is very rich and has many 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.650
 vitamins 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.540
 we are very healthy as life is like 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.250
 just born he even has enzymes that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.030
 They help you to digest 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.069
 this would cover it 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.040
 and I would water it again tomorrow and night 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:44.670
 until it is maintained is a way of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.670
 keep it and who does not spoil 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.920
 but now I'm going to empty everything for 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.530
 teach you to start the zero 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.130
 imagine you are many to eat this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.440
 ya lola marín 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.780
 I recover my jar 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.610
 if you do not have this glass jar so 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.290
 nice to finish then you can 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.510
 do similar catch it and diego with a 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.780
 glass jar catch the idea of ​​the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.780
 little holes and nothing and make some invention 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.340
 I do not have clean 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.250
 and we start again these are the 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.790
 seeds that I have told you before we are going to 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.350
 put a few but not many because 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.110
 because this is when it starts to 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.450
 grow will fill the whole pot and if 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.700
 there are too many, it 's like everything 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.489
 they stack up with each other and not 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.910
 germinate well we put water back 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.330
 but this time we 're going to leave it at 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.650
 less eight hours soak for 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.269
 begin to germinate as the first 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.269
 push cited well hydrated 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.010
 when these 8 hours pass, they are all 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.650
 we will empty the water 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.830
 and we will do the east cycle of watering tomorrow 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.930
 and night is that as life does not 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.520
 open the seed has a little green 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.890
 you eat it, seeing it with more green starts it 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.430
 to bulge more and start to grow 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.080
 until you get this 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.160
 that very simple since you already know 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.150
 make seeds the germinating jar or 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.150
 some similar invention 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.030
 trip to milan come see you up 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.030
