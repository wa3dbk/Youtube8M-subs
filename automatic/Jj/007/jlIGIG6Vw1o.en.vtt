that I actually think it would be to the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.300 
that I actually think it would be to the
heights<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.910> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.480> I<00:01:25.160> don't<00:01:26.160> even

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
heights that it is now I don't even

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.220 
heights that it is now I don't even
think<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> could<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.790> predicted<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230
