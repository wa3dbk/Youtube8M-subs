00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you die with this exploit I think you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.850 
you die with this exploit I think you
still<00:02:13.239> have<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:13.599> yep<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.989> still<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
still have it yep you still have it is

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.649 
still have it yep you still have it is
so<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.430> not<00:02:15.550> like<00:02:15.730> no<00:02:15.879> clip<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.450> don't<00:02:16.569> have

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
so it's not like no clip you don't have

so it's not like no clip you don't have
to<00:02:16.750> keep<00:02:16.870> changing<00:02:17.379> it<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.920> turn<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.430> off<00:02:18.610> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
to keep changing it and to turn it off I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.740 
to keep changing it and to turn it off I
think<00:02:20.200> what<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.340> your<00:02:21.700> movie<00:02:22.180> restore

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
think what we do is your movie restore

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.720 
think what we do is your movie restore
with<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.050> original<00:02:23.140> code<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.859> then<00:02:24.340> restore

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
with the original code and then restore

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.800 
with the original code and then restore
with<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:24.969> original<00:02:25.060> code<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.599> you're<00:02:25.689> back

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
with the original code and you're back

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.600 
with the original code and you're back
to<00:02:25.840> normal
