00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

I<00:00:00.060> went<00:00:00.299> ahead<00:00:00.420> and<00:00:00.690> did<00:00:00.840> everything<00:00:01.070> but

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
I went ahead and did everything but

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.030 
I went ahead and did everything but
we'll<00:00:02.399> be<00:00:02.429> focusing<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.929> nose<00:00:04.140> many<00:00:04.770> times

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
we'll be focusing on the nose many times

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.299 
we'll be focusing on the nose many times
people<00:00:05.279> think<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.390> manga<00:00:07.130> people<00:00:08.130> don't

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
people think that in manga people don't

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.339 
people think that in manga people don't
really<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.790> noses<00:00:09.150> but<00:00:09.719> if<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.170> look

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
really have noses but if you look

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.950 
really have noses but if you look
carefully<00:00:10.650> through<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.309> different<00:00:11.820> man<00:00:12.630> gets

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
carefully through the different man gets

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.900 
carefully through the different man gets
through<00:00:13.200> different<00:00:13.679> enemies<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.460> come<00:00:14.790> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
through different enemies you come and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
through different enemies you come and
realize<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.960> characters<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
realize that the characters have a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.099 
realize that the characters have a
different<00:00:17.940> nose<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.900> identify

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
different nose and so you can identify

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.160 
different nose and so you can identify
with<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.890> different<00:00:20.750> character<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.930> that's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
with a different character and that's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
with a different character and that's
what<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.590> basically<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.550> look<00:00:23.760> at

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
what we're basically going to look at

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.390 
what we're basically going to look at
here<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.600> some<00:00:24.869> four<00:00:25.529> different<00:00:25.949> types<00:00:26.189> of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
here just some four different types of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
here just some four different types of
course<00:00:26.730> there<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.060> whole<00:00:27.660> lot<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:28.109> different

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
course there are whole lot of different

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279 
course there are whole lot of different
other<00:00:28.830> types<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.849> noses<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.810> want<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
other types of noses but we want to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.120 
other types of noses but we want to
focus<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.200> you'd<00:00:34.200> say<00:00:34.380> more<00:00:34.649> or<00:00:34.739> less<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
focus on the you'd say more or less the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.130 
focus on the you'd say more or less the
popular<00:00:36.079> genres<00:00:37.079> which<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:39.140> okay

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
popular genres which are out there okay

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.639 
popular genres which are out there okay
I've<00:00:40.440> gone<00:00:41.040> ahead<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> focused<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:43.200> first

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I've gone ahead and focused on our first

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.610 
I've gone ahead and focused on our first
one<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> I'll<00:00:47.789> go<00:00:48.030> ahead<00:00:48.059> now<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.840> start

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
one here so I'll go ahead now and start

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
one here so I'll go ahead now and start
and<00:00:51.230> I'll<00:00:52.230> start<00:00:52.620> from<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> bottom<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.850> work

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and I'll start from the bottom and work

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.670 
and I'll start from the bottom and work
my<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.860> they<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.579> easier<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.449> do

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
my way up they because it's easier to do

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.819 
my way up they because it's easier to do
that<00:00:58.680> way<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.399> least<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.820> me<00:01:00.469> possibly<00:01:01.469> people

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
that way at least for me possibly people

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
that way at least for me possibly people
who<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.010> left-handed<00:01:02.460> would<00:01:02.910> work<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.329> other

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
who are left-handed would work the other

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:24.090 
who are left-handed would work the other
way

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:40.540 

it's<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:25.240> simple

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.630 

I<00:01:41.620> really<00:01:42.620> don't<00:01:42.830> want<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.160> overwork<00:01:43.580> it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
I really don't want to overwork it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.220 
I really don't want to overwork it
because<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.270> may<00:01:44.660> lose<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:47.240> character<00:01:47.840> there

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.180 

okay<00:01:55.120> so<00:01:56.120> simple<00:01:56.870> as<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:56.990> don't<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.890> anymore

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
okay so simple as that don't do anymore

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.960 
okay so simple as that don't do anymore
and<00:01:58.700> that's<00:01:59.690> it<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:04.220> may<00:02:04.400> want<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.730> give

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
and that's it and you may want to give

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.940 
and that's it and you may want to give
it<00:02:05.090> some<00:02:05.300> shading<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.350> have<00:02:06.680> some

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
it some shading just to have some

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:16.720 
it some shading just to have some
contrast<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.030> I'll<00:02:08.180> go<00:02:08.450> ahead<00:02:15.010> okay<00:02:16.010> that's<00:02:16.490> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
contrast so I'll go ahead okay that's it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.190 
contrast so I'll go ahead okay that's it
we<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.540> move<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.020> next<00:02:18.230> one<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:19.030> but

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
we can move to the next one then but

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.980 
we can move to the next one then but
i'll<00:02:21.200> go<00:02:21.530> ahead<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.370> one<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.390> this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
i'll go ahead and do this one and this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.230 
i'll go ahead and do this one and this
one<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:24.680> keep<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.580> simply<00:02:26.120> there<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.850> just

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
one just keep it simply there it's just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.340 
one just keep it simply there it's just
like<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> slight<00:02:30.670> arch<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:33.220> slide<00:02:34.220> half<00:02:34.610> moon

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
like a slight arch there slide half moon

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.400 
like a slight arch there slide half moon
that's<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.740> no<00:02:37.370> need<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.820> do<00:02:37.970> anything<00:02:38.410> after

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
that's it no need to do anything after

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.880 
that's it no need to do anything after
that<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:40.580> pretty<00:02:40.730> simple<00:02:41.270> but<00:02:41.630> let's<00:02:42.380> give

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
that it's pretty simple but let's give

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.449 
that it's pretty simple but let's give
some<00:02:43.160> shading<00:02:43.490> just<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:45.100> give<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.130> some<00:02:46.570> depth

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
some shading just to give it some depth

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.260 
some shading just to give it some depth
so<00:02:51.040> typically<00:02:52.040> you'll<00:02:52.190> find<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.640> shading<00:02:53.090> in

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
so typically you'll find the shading in

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.979 
so typically you'll find the shading in
there<00:02:53.510> which<00:02:53.840> actually<00:02:54.230> comes<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.920> give<00:02:55.250> it

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
there which actually comes to give it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.990 
there which actually comes to give it
the<00:02:56.989> depth<00:02:57.320> which<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.890> needs

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.940 

so<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.930> kind<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.710> don't

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
so you see so you kind of just don't

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.320 
so you see so you kind of just don't
have<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> nose<00:03:08.400> floating<00:03:09.000> out<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:11.330> actually

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
have a nose floating out there actually

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.580 
have a nose floating out there actually
has<00:03:12.450> some<00:03:12.870> depth<00:03:13.910> that's<00:03:14.910> basically<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.290> I

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
has some depth that's basically it and I

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.480 
has some depth that's basically it and I
think<00:03:16.830> I'll<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.220> leave<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:19.130> leave<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.190> there

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
think I'll just leave it leave it there

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.580 
think I'll just leave it leave it there
look<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.820> we'll<00:03:24.240> go<00:03:24.450> ahead<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.750> do<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.320> one

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
look so we'll go ahead and do this one

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.380 
look so we'll go ahead and do this one
and<00:03:25.860> in<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.220> case<00:03:26.459> we're<00:03:26.760> looking<00:03:27.030> at<00:03:27.360> a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
and in this case we're looking at a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.380 
and in this case we're looking at a
