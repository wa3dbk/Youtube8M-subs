 sugar and began to beat when and 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.280
 ingredients of our dough we add 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.809
 little by little the sifted flour we continue 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.650
 beating for the dough to take 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.220
 consistency and to conclude it's up to us 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.750
 work a little helped from our 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.360
 hands 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 we will continue to knead all 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 ingredients until a dough is left 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.539
 with the texture and consistency that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.990
 we want and we will remove the mass of 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:22.430
 our bowl and lass we will place between two 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 vegetable papers 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.250
 then we stretch the dough 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.120
 helping us with a roller with levels 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.150
 so that it comes out perfectly balanced 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.030
 and finally we will introduce it into 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.030
 refrigerator between 2 and 3 hours 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.100
 already it is being left less to have lists 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.770
 our cookies we take out of the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.160
 refrigerated the dough that we had 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.430
 previously introduced below 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.790
 we cut it with the cutters that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.640
 we like it we have decided 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.009
 prepare this with halloween shapes and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.670
 our cookie tray is ready 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.750
 to put it in the oven we light 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.810
 the bottom to 180 degrees and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.530
 we place the tray in the middle of the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.440
 oven we are going to bake for 10 minutes 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.950
 or until they start to toast the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.000
 edges from the oven once the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.370
 we let five minutes rest and we passed 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.629
 to a grate to cool 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.230
 and once cooled they are ready to 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.230
 eat them
