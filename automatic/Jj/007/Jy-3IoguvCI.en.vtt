00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.570
 free trade for this tablet blog.de i 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.630
 I'm just at the booth of sony and we 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.300
 have the new sony vaio temple is one 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 new 11.6 inch tablet with windows down 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.950
 as you can see on the tiles because 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.910
 As I said 11.6 inches we have a full 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.099
 hd resolution so 1920 x 1200 pixels 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.860
 under it hides an intel core i5 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.270
 this is the new currently also the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.290
 title came with a memory 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.839
 as well as 128 gigabytes ssd that all stands 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.910
 but not forever for each test because 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.829
 as usual with sony one will go in the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.280
 Configure shop again as you like 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.739
 can 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.359
 So you can do more 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.160
 memory space or something needed 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.140
 accordingly, the tablet costs 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.170
 but also more standard is the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.739
 price at 799 euro and the sony 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.809
 vaio tab will appear in october well 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.519
 Why do we turn around the tray? 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.900
 a front camera and in the typical 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.130
 windows home button 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.500
 then hides behind this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.290
 Cover a micro sd card slot and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.760
 obviously in some devices a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.680
 sim card slot 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.990
 also in the plate as we see here 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 next to it is a so -called 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.120
 sony first button you need to be honest 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.690
 said not then we have a fan 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.100
 Slit with 2 hess but wants a bit 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.140
 still need 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 the newest processor from intel anyway 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.060
 we have a USB 2.0 connection 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.780
 Under this flap company was one 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.360
 micro usb connection and a hdmi usb 3.0 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 micro usb hdmi output 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.049
 then we have the connection for let's 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.280
 talk and nothing else on 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.920
 we have one on this page 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.530
 volume rocker a power button and 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.440
 I suspect that is behind you here 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.789
 audio output or 1 gampe citizen such a 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.369
 headset out input 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.990
 me this backup is from sony in it 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.940
 but I assume that there is no 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.210
 any kind of Kensington lock or so 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.210
 is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.209
 Well that's the tablet 1.6 should like 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.709
 said we need to know windows 8 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.019
 do not look any further 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.750
 interesting is that keyboard cover that 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.069
 one gets delivered with is out 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.050
 plastic one has but a full-fledged 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.840
 keyboard does not feel quite like that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.780
 high quality as the thin sony vaio z 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.879
 wave itself but good it is only one 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.620
 keyboard is not that right but 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.110
 is not quite the same nor as 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.430
 protection for the display 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.160
 So you have someone like that 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.489
 full-blown ultrabook netbook how to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.030
 would like to 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.620
 There is also a stylus and that 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.140
 you can make handwritten notes 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 shows megamarkt we know from different 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.370
 men of other windows 8 tablet is 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.040
 sometimes quite practical to 100 to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.989
 this not any time 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.239
 preinstalled finally joins a note 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.769
 not so special but in handy 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.629
 if you have a second wheel and take notes 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.150
 Of course, when he says he wants to do 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.980
 but also some features for the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.950
 stylus integrates the hand disablement 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.349
 is basically pretty good 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.450
 that's a first short with cent 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.040
 the sony vaio carpet is attacking 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.040
 tablet lures the app to see
