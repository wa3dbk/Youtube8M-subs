because the storm is rolling in and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
because the storm is rolling in and
standing<00:00:27.630> next<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.019> cannon<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> good

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
standing next to a cannon is not a good

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.690 
standing next to a cannon is not a good
place<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.939> lightning<00:00:30.330> strikes<00:00:31.700> okay

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
place to be when lightning strikes okay

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.729 
place to be when lightning strikes okay
so<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:33.300> using<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.690> swarm<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> challenge

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so I'm using a swarm for this challenge

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190 
so I'm using a swarm for this challenge
because<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.219> warm<00:00:35.610> sorrow<00:00:36.000> talents<00:00:36.480> it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
because it's warm sorrow talents it's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.160 
because it's warm sorrow talents it's
out<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> only<00:00:37.739> fitting<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.960> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
out that it only fitting and on this you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
out that it only fitting and on this you
want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> lead<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.370> less<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
want to lead just a little bit less you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.360 
want to lead just a little bit less you
lot<00:00:44.940> early<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.860> aim<00:00:47.190> with

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
lot early and you can you can aim with

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.240 
lot early and you can you can aim with
left<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.420> stake<00:00:49.160> there<00:00:50.160> we

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
left and right I'm gonna stake there we

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.550 
left and right I'm gonna stake there we
go

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
go

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.090 
go
[Applause]

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
[Applause]

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
[Applause]
so<00:00:53.100> basically<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.879> three<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.300> four<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so basically get like three or four this

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.410 
so basically get like three or four this
you<00:00:54.809> hit<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> different

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
you hit and then you go to a different

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
you hit and then you go to a different
cannon<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.260> test<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.100> them

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
cannon and you test that out for them

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.279 
cannon and you test that out for them
and<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.629> fly<00:01:00.930> through<00:01:01.140> these

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and I'm just gonna fly through these

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.860 
and I'm just gonna fly through these
guys<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.129> power<00:01:02.460> throw<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.239> fast<00:01:03.300> as

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
guys and this power throw as fast as

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.130 
guys and this power throw as fast as
possible<00:01:04.350> because<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:06.210> gets<00:01:06.450> really<00:01:06.930> hairy

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
possible because it gets really hairy

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010 
possible because it gets really hairy
later<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.640> add<00:01:08.880> rocks<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.900> gonna

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
later on so you add rocks so it's gonna

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
later on so you add rocks so it's gonna
do<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.320> harder<00:01:10.640> it's<00:01:11.640> again<00:01:11.880> time<00:01:12.330> alright

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
do a lot harder it's again time alright

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
do a lot harder it's again time alright
leave<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.460> suit<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
leave out a little bit just suit a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.289 
leave out a little bit just suit a
little<00:01:14.760> bit<00:01:14.970> early<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.610> make<00:01:17.610> sure<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> try

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
out time here for the rocks there we go

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.330 
out time here for the rocks there we go
so<00:01:21.810> let's<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.229> fly<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.900> excuse<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.340> come

everything
over<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.500> way<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.659> did<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.780> once<00:01:34.049> before<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
over this way I did this once before and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.179 
over this way I did this once before and
I<00:01:34.560> failed<00:01:34.970> because<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.630> fourth<00:01:37.380> wave<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.009> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I failed because this fourth wave it is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.390 
I failed because this fourth wave it is
really<00:01:39.150> insane<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> distance<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
really insane this is a distance I so

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.120 
really insane this is a distance I so
bad<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:43.579> it<00:01:44.579> slid<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:46.110> bit<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.530> again

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bad but it slid a little bit right again

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.230 
bad but it slid a little bit right again
next<00:01:47.340> time

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
next time

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.370 
next time
there<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.840> go<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> each<00:01:52.110> time

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
there we go and this one and each time

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.500 
there we go and this one and each time
we<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.640> goes<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> lot<00:01:54.000> faster<00:01:54.240> time<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
we see one it goes a lot faster time so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.430 
we see one it goes a lot faster time so
three<00:01:57.510> two<00:01:58.050> one<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.920> shoot<00:01:59.630> ya<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.930> there

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
line so I'm just gonna shut down flyby

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.639 
line so I'm just gonna shut down flyby
flight<00:02:08.729> around<00:02:08.880> these<00:02:09.060> guys<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.380> really
