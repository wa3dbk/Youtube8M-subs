look at the specifications we got on
this<00:00:13.679> virtual<00:00:13.860> machine<00:00:14.690> as<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:15.870> see<00:00:15.960> we

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
this virtual machine as you can see we

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.080 
this virtual machine as you can see we
got<00:00:16.109> about<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:17.100> gigabytes<00:00:17.609> total<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
got about two gigabytes total on the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.189 
got about two gigabytes total on the
disk<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:19.170> 1.5<00:00:19.920> gigs<00:00:20.189> free<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:21.539> mall

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
disk and about 1.5 gigs free but mall

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.390 
disk and about 1.5 gigs free but mall
dog<00:00:22.410> will<00:00:22.529> certainly<00:00:22.800> change<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
dog will certainly change all that so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160 
dog will certainly change all that so
we'll<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.580> ahead<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.760> run<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.810> supposed<00:00:25.109> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
realize is that past your desktop it is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.340 
realize is that past your desktop it is
still<00:01:28.680> filling<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> got<00:01:31.079> the

still filling them up so I got the
original<00:01:31.680> model<00:01:32.070> executable<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:32.939> our

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
original model executable here on our

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.080 
original model executable here on our
desktop<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.570> got<00:01:33.689> shroom<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
desktop we got shroom and it's just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.030 
desktop we got shroom and it's just
going<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.079> shroom

let's<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.160> how<00:01:44.280> many<00:01:44.430> items<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.730> have<00:01:46.400> 18<00:01:47.400> I

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
let's see how many items we have 18 I

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.270 
let's see how many items we have 18 I
know<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:48.120> it's<00:01:48.540> quite<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> few<00:01:48.990> shortcuts<00:01:49.280> if

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
know for it's quite a few shortcuts if

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.930 
know for it's quite a few shortcuts if
we<00:01:50.370> were<00:01:50.460> fresh<00:01:52.190> now<00:01:53.190> we<00:01:53.280> got<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.430> bunch<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.670> Bush

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
we were fresh now we got a bunch of Bush

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.040 
we were fresh now we got a bunch of Bush
dot<00:01:54.330> exe<00:01:54.479> s<00:01:56.060> WS<00:01:57.060> taken<00:01:57.390> over<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.570> computer

dot exe s WS taken over your computer

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.730 
dot exe s WS taken over your computer
again<00:01:59.119> now<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.330> over<00:02:00.540> 10,000<00:02:01.110> items<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
again now we have over 10,000 items and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940 
again now we have over 10,000 items and
these<00:02:02.670> aren't<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.970> shortcuts<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.740> take<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
these aren't just shortcuts if we take a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
these aren't just shortcuts if we take a
look<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.280> C<00:02:05.490> driver<00:02:06.060> yet<00:02:06.690> our<00:02:08.450> available

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
look at the C driver yet our available

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.120 
look at the C driver yet our available
space<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.810> rapidly<00:02:10.229> diminishing<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:10.979> down

space is rapidly diminishing we are down

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.260 
space is rapidly diminishing we are down
to<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.459> four<00:02:11.670> hundred<00:02:12.030> megabytes<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:14.270> since

that we are down another 50 megabytes to
366<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.220> see<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.640> filling<00:02:21.209> up<00:02:21.300> your

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
366 so as you see it is filling up your

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.590 
366 so as you see it is filling up your
hard<00:02:21.570> drive<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.110> kind<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.320> bad

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
hard drive which is kind of bad

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
hard drive which is kind of bad
eventually<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.870> should<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.230> running<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
eventually we should be running out of

eventually we should be running out of
space<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.330> were<00:02:30.390> aware<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:30.810> was

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
oh it is still going I guess we got to

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.270 
oh it is still going I guess we got to
restart<00:04:27.580> but<00:04:28.479> uh<00:04:28.510> it's<00:04:29.500> not<00:04:29.680> really<00:04:29.950> point<00:04:30.160> and

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
restart but uh it's not really point and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.730 
restart but uh it's not really point and
we're<00:04:30.370> starting<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:30.760> just<00:04:30.820> showing<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.270> so

you can have a real lack of disk space

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.029 
you can have a real lack of disk space
to<00:04:40.930> work<00:04:41.050> with<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.380> that's<00:04:41.500> about<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.860> for<00:04:41.950> the
