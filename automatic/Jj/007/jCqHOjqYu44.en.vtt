move<00:00:23.930> in<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.170> game<00:00:24.320> but<00:00:25.250> before<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:25.610> get<00:00:25.730> into

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
move in the game but before I get into

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.210 
move in the game but before I get into
why<00:00:26.270> here's<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.230> quick<00:00:27.410> rundown<00:00:27.590> of<00:00:27.830> what<00:00:28.100> we

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
why here's a quick rundown of what we

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.290 
why here's a quick rundown of what we
already<00:00:28.460> know<00:00:28.730> about<00:00:28.970> her<00:00:29.060> face

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.100 

so<00:00:33.200> here<00:00:33.440> we<00:00:33.559> have<00:00:33.590> Molina's<00:00:34.190> fade<00:00:34.430> options

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
so here we have Molina's fade options

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.670 
so here we have Molina's fade options
she<00:00:36.110> could<00:00:36.260> fade<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.559> place<00:00:36.800> fade<00:00:37.790> backers<00:00:38.270> say

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
she could fade in place fade backers say

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.350 
she could fade in place fade backers say
towards<00:00:39.680> her<00:00:39.800> corner<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.399> in<00:00:41.030> close<00:00:41.239> range

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
towards her corner and in close range

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.180 
towards her corner and in close range

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
fate behind them while invisible she

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.069 
fate behind them while invisible she
avoids<00:00:46.579> any<00:00:46.760> attack<00:00:47.120> that's<00:00:47.510> not<00:00:47.720> a<00:00:47.750> ground

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
avoids any attack that's not a ground

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.979 
avoids any attack that's not a ground
pad

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.660 

she<00:00:56.989> can<00:00:57.140> also<00:00:57.289> delay<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:58.010> how<00:00:58.160> long<00:00:58.399> she

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
she can also delay just how long she

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.520 
she can also delay just how long she
stays<00:00:58.910> hidden<00:00:59.149> for<00:00:59.690> about<00:00:59.930> up<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.350> three

stays hidden for about up to three

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.289 
stays hidden for about up to three
seconds<00:01:03.369> the<00:01:04.369> difference<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.879> with<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.150> ex

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
seconds the difference is with the ex

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.539 
seconds the difference is with the ex
fade<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:05.810> primarily<00:01:06.590> lie<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.460> her

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
fade now primarily lie and her

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.210 
fade now primarily lie and her
invincibility<00:01:08.119> on<00:01:08.360> startup<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.740> insane

invincibility on startup and the insane
recoveries<00:01:10.880> feed<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:14.330> what<00:01:14.509> does<00:01:14.659> this<00:01:14.750> mean

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
recoveries feed so what does this mean

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.260 
recoveries feed so what does this mean
well<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.520> lot<00:01:17.149> actually<00:01:18.550> if<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.759> saw<00:01:19.970> take<00:01:20.240> a

well a lot actually if you saw take a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.899 
well a lot actually if you saw take a
chance<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:20.750> guides<00:01:20.960> you'll<00:01:21.890> know<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.220> exa<00:01:22.670> can

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
chance as guides you'll know the exa can

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.789 
chance as guides you'll know the exa can
be<00:01:23.030> used<00:01:23.210> at<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.450> end<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.750> block<00:01:23.960> string<00:01:24.320> to

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
be used at the end of a block string to

be used at the end of a block string to
not<00:01:24.979> only<00:01:25.100> make<00:01:25.369> Molina<00:01:25.700> safe<00:01:26.110> but<00:01:27.110> leave<00:01:27.320> her

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
you to link together strings it wouldn't

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.210 
you to link together strings it wouldn't
be<00:01:37.820> possible<00:01:38.000> otherwise<00:01:38.800> creating<00:01:39.800> some<00:01:39.979> very

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
be possible otherwise creating some very

then<00:01:50.610> yeah<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.420> also<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.870> as<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> strong

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
then yeah we also know that as a strong

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.040 
then yeah we also know that as a strong
wake<00:01:52.830> up<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:53.160> drop<00:01:53.520> day<00:01:53.790> long<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.720> she<00:01:54.930> can

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:11.550 

Oh

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.530 

all<00:02:12.370> these<00:02:12.670> things<00:02:12.940> should<00:02:13.120> already<00:02:13.300> be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
all these things should already be

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.320 
all these things should already be
enough<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.110> make<00:02:14.260> my<00:02:14.440> case<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:16.120> there's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
enough to make my case but there's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.110 
enough to make my case but there's
another<00:02:16.630> use<00:02:16.900> for<00:02:16.930> exp<00:02:17.650> one<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.849> only

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
another use for exp one that has only

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
another use for exp one that has only
really<00:02:19.569> been<00:02:19.690> hinted<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.580> one<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:22.060> time

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
really been hinted and one that in time

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.620 
really been hinted and one that in time
could<00:02:23.290> end<00:02:23.440> up<00:02:23.590> defining<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.910> how<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.180> best

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
could end up defining just how to best

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.229 
could end up defining just how to best
play<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.170> variation<00:02:26.920> all<00:02:27.069> together<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.090> if

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
play this variation all together so if

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.759 
play this variation all together so if
you're<00:02:28.420> still<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> fence<00:02:28.930> about<00:02:29.410> the

you're still on the fence about the
