00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.460
 videos 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 behind the value of this action and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.759
 It is also Eduardo Gomez when got 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.789
 in the center of the ball he is leaving you 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.650
 it seemed like it was for more comes out now 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.509
 playing the touch directly for the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 arrival I was looking for the short touch 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.170
 opening now for q coop 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.629
 is going to play for samayoa that way 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.530
 that you have faith the auction does not have to 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.000
 mode 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.280
 in the analysis today 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.370
 in the team from courts then they 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.309
 we tell why you are looking for it during and 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.620
 after the gloves and the ball goes away 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.690
 above the arch it seemed that the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.220
 opening on the scoreboard and that's what 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.250
 we also mentioned on behalf of Luis 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.930
 martínez is an aspiring player who 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.610
 he knows how to run behind his backs 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.430
 defenses in this case played him perfect 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.410
 the return to a likewise that is 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.970
 get hooked but how long is it 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.340
 leg your stride frequency 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.960
 prolonged almost to reach 30 minutes 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.920
 in the Mario camposeco when he puts the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.659
 center the ball seemed to work 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.329
 one side of the stick 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.789
 or almost and would address the blooper of the 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.939
 night what if we saw the move to 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.729
 decorate because you do not have control 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.200
 of the ball and the goalkeeper goes but does not 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.200
 Tell your player what's going 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.420
 the ground floor has the mark of marmosets 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.940
 to get far south of the center's 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.530
 head butt that came back tried 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.340
 look for it in the air at half height 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.170
 you have a greater 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.420
 samayoa trying to make the hitch 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.640
 out the target curve leads but 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.130
 the ball will move outside the arc 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.690
 pretty but that has no transcendence 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 in the marker of the one that is touching has 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.150
 wanted to move the marker here in there 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.360
 return a foul and reprimand later 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.430
 Jose Manuel 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.290
 yes for claudio albizuris second 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.560
 cautioned for the municipal team 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.810
 there stops the player July estacuy and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 with this he accumulates his door in 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.110
 tournament the case of claudio albizuris no 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.210
 will be next weekend when 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.730
 municipal receive the set of heredia 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.700
 it is not by the force of the fault but yes 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.890
 by the reiteration of the same 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.440
 people would be better for pedro still 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.260
 but there was samayoa step on the ball 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.069
 I will tell you something else 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.069
 wheelock 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.970
 well let's go we were there to claudio the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.230
 peanut albizuris and now then the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.270
 in the second game of the second 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 yellow warning and therefore the red 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.790
 yes that stays with days the team of 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.650
 municipal ownership and control of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.330
 party by presence in the area of 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.230
 municipal team that was all that 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.390
 won in the first hand 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.780
 the ball that was left now is the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.780
 eat 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.880
 is marking criminal 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.320
 got lost by a stranger in the party 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.060
 he himself escaped the domain and the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.580
 control of a meeting that does not give you 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.770
 to lose yourself in that way we are 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.880
 reaching very very complicated limits 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.610
 until the repetition is going to tell us 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.640
 many things gets in the way of walking 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.380
 part of de isela martínez no longer able 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.350
 stop the body is already a reaction 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.730
 unthought of part of I made the base in the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.180
 tournament the historic and captain and 9 of 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.180
 left 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.750
 I'm going 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:29.460
 the politician and others but queen puts him 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:32.509
 on a tray the Brazilian does not waste 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.690
 chapín and is up with the maximum penalty 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:39.259
 the 9 is uncovered and crashes in the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.259
 closing 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.570
 now on the side we are in 89 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.850
 minutes chinchilla trying to get the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.389
 center are returning the value to 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.389
 counted 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.590
 sela 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.590
 is for the little south that is 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.530
 above borat and that only as 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.870
 watch as the match ends with 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.389
 liquidate in the end is another was a 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.610
 another party's play is one of those 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.370
 definitions that clearly mark the 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.759
 difference between who knows between whom 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.500
 He has a perfectly educated leg 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.650
 if we go to the education of the leg 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.139
 It would be as a college for 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.330
 the Costa Rican player of the set 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.490
 of the xelajú mario camposeco first 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.229
 because he knows where he is standing because 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.789
 see the movement of the goalkeeper and this 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.680
 do not look askance because you already know how 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.560
 enter the ball that surface of 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.470
 contact have on the spherical all 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.710
 this in a fraction of seconds is a power 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.800
 of impressive resolution the one that has 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.479
 sergio morals and at the height of the minute 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.280
 who says get this is pretty much 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.100
 to seal 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.460
 to clear it prefers to do it in 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.560
 cortito the Honduran archer ladies and 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.300
 Gentlemen ends the match 2 to 0 is the 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.630
 municipal arrival josé manuel soberanis 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.680
 at court level in the mario camposeco 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.440
 welcome teacher who tells us about 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.560
 this journey no no no nothing you do not 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.560
 they saw 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:39.960
 we do not talk about now we were not seven 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.960
 matches and yes 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.080
 we got a victory the truth that 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.600
 it is for god we are in a very moment 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.210
 difficult but also the soccer ratio 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.460
 but I think with those victories and 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.660
 the goal for me I think for all the 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.310
 team is not enough moral and good 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.080
 why all rethink in another party the 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.960
 very difficult but I think good hug 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.440
 it's golf and it does not arrive at the moment 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:13.060
 true is sure is the best people 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:17.530
 because to me normal 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:20.920
 17 very happy I wanted to send today we 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:24.730
 say hello kill me for you but now my 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.560
 cousins and abroad but greetings 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.220
 to go and empty that is the goal 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.510
 only we know that this one 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.780
 in the first round for us was the 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.180
 wta that is very bad but I think it is 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.290
 improving and good I think little by little 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.290
 the team would be up
