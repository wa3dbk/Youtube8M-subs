these little shaky spots in the grass

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.830 
these little shaky spots in the grass
and<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.119> you're<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and so then you're just going to want to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.210 
and so then you're just going to want to
walk<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> shaky<00:01:22.680> spot<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> got

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
walk right in the shaky spot and I got

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.499 
walk right in the shaky spot and I got
actually<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.729> lucky<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.090> fund<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> right

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
actually really lucky and fund it right

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.149 
actually really lucky and fund it right
on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> first<00:01:24.810> try<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:25.979> really

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
on the first try so that was really

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.550 
on the first try so that was really
awesome<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.790> usually<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.420> takes<00:01:27.600> about<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
awesome but usually it takes about I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.749 
awesome but usually it takes about I
think<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> five<00:01:29.159> percent<00:01:29.460> chance<00:01:29.640> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
think there's a five percent chance of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.710 
think there's a five percent chance of
finding<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.240> you're<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> do

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
finding it so you're gonna have to do

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
finding it so you're gonna have to do
that<00:01:30.869> quite<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.280> actually<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.729> your

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that quite a bit to to actually get your

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.450 
that quite a bit to to actually get your
ninetails<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.770> just<00:01:34.770> keep<00:01:34.920> walking<00:01:35.280> back<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
ninetails so just keep walking back and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.859 
ninetails so just keep walking back and
forth<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> grass<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> wait<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
forth in the grass and wait for one of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
forth in the grass and wait for one of
those<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.320> shaky<00:01:38.100> spots<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:38.640> just

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
those little shaky spots and then just

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.890 
those little shaky spots and then just
walk<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.240> top<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.869> should

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
