going<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.700> using<00:02:30.880> about<00:02:31.150> equal<00:02:31.570> amounts<00:02:31.990> of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to be using about equal amounts of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.850 
going to be using about equal amounts of
everything<00:02:32.800> in<00:02:32.920> here<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> that's<00:02:34.600> probably<00:02:35.560> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
everything in here so that's probably a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.090 
everything in here so that's probably a
good<00:02:36.190> amount<00:02:36.820> we've<00:02:37.630> got<00:02:37.870> raspberry<00:02:38.770> leaf

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
good amount we've got raspberry leaf

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.330 
good amount we've got raspberry leaf
which<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.330> always<00:02:40.720> say<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:40.990> it's<00:02:41.380> very<00:02:41.680> poofy

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
so you always know what the raspberry

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.970 
so you always know what the raspberry
leaf<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.490> very<00:02:45.910> very<00:02:46.180> poofy<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.410> raspberry

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
leaf is very very poofy so raspberry

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.100 
leaf is very very poofy so raspberry
leaf<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.400> wonderful<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.300> very<00:02:49.600> anti

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
leaf is wonderful it's very anti

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.660 
leaf is wonderful it's very anti
bacterial<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.070> great<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.459> lot<00:02:51.520> of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
case it's very anti bacterial it's also

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.310 
case it's very anti bacterial it's also
anti<00:02:59.260> gingivitis<00:02:59.800> if<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.550> believe<00:03:01.320> you
