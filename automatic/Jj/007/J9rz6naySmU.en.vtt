00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.870
 r 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.409
 Hello in this video just a small formation over a single 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:18.070
 Weak point in Windows XP, as I said, old and was also the active time never 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.739
 the biggest threat anyway, it is a vulnerability and therefore can 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.900
 so far it is important to exploit 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.359
 that we know the whole thing 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.839
 sometimes when you think you have checked everything it comes down to being accurate 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.100
 overlooked this point 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.350
 the so-called departure gap is the top priority they know 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.400
 certainly for years but without knowing exactly how the whole thing exactly 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.900
 now works an example that demonstrates on all-popular 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.560
 Calculator 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.160
 they know that they can call this from any position below 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.790
 over the start menu 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.160
 and then execute 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 You can also call without having to enter the complete numbers 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.200
 this works because Windows does not just stop in the directory after the program 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.730
 searches by starting the command but in this case also to 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.750
 Example in the directory System 32 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.160
 that's why 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.410
 Kayak everywhere are here once the system 32 times a statement 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 Blatter and here we have our pocket calculator 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.790
 So our people look at us a little closer to their serve 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.470
 Kayak Point AXA opens 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 Click on Play and what happens it opens Not device 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.810
 there it is our gap we do not want to start a complex and it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.010
 just appears complex and not because they made a mistake and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.110
 not because of ours 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.580
 Calculator was hijacked as an application like the one in the other video 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.900
 Semper Video have already shown but because Windows does not do what 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.950
 should do it 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.469
 So let's get back to our top priority so the problem seems so 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.990
 to be a directory 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.610
 this is even more important than the system 32 directory so we have to 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.370
 from which directory that is and why that is a problem for 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.210
 could represent us so far I have now here a bed neighborhoods 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.930
 The only one simple message I have now here on mine 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 the DOSB is called in virus points who carries 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.169
 Let's take a look 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.050
 but only a text 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.540
 does not work properly but for our purposes it is completely sufficient 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 the only important thing is that we get output in this line in this case 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.520
 run this line 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.000
 this file is located in the System 32 directory 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.409
 has risen 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.820
 with control and sees grouping and then just here in the Windows directory 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.910
 System 32 is already dumping Marshall on incidents 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.619
 the second step 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.169
 the same in green but this time with the windows directory 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.369
 b 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:05.369
 save 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.849
 Copy 17 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.669
 v 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.669
 a game 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.599
 CG Roth 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.579
 Control CG 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.579
 Control continues 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 and finally 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.870
 linux-user 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.870
 listed 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.019
 See starting point 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.019
 Control before 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.239
 So now that we have the file in four different positions, too 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.370
 If we have copied a disk we need only call it up 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.030
 and we'll see which of these four windows windows is actually 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.169
 Call that means which one 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:06.150
 remains in the parish church Tel at the top Rogowski stands out with the murderer 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:10.019
 if the gentleman gets the text delivered we go into the appropriate one 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.139
 Have file in it if the text tells us yes the directory by the file 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.099
 drinliegt 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.599
 so thoroughly that you minimize startup running 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.099
 18 d AXA 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.560
 k &amp; k virus point the reality 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.059
 these will be some users, that is, the directory with the highest 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.909
 priority 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.189
 is not that these are 32 directory but that users 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:41.900
 listed 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.720
 he now wants to know which directory with the second highest 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.830
 Priority list we just need the appropriate judgment 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.879
 the expectant mother directories have to remove 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.920
 and call each case again 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.430
 The file is still in the system as something own 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.660
 that means that now it is the normal way the second most important directory 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.570
 our calculator 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.050
 is that because it is the 32 listed 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.050
 that they shoot too 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.569
 Spranger game a bit further news 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.589
 it is in the 32nd 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:28.299
 remove any of our videos points as well 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.020
 sometimes the whole thing 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.320
 windows directory is the third most important directory 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.819
 also introduce here 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.539
 and now has been misspelled 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.979
 what does the seum directory mean is not a system directory at all 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.979
 So not started 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.030
 So now it is clear that the problem is that files in 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.979
 our user directory are 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.370
 this lying in the dental clinic he heard 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.130
 as the same files in the system 32 folders so it has synonymous 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.280
 just with my calculator and notepad working here i have now 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.129
 ever that 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:22.520
 own video 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.259
 Directory called so that user directories and here I mean 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.250
 Calc exe 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.480
 which is not really fatter about a case was what he is now 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.960
 here 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.360
 according to the texts 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.370
 So there is no problem in the book in the book 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.430
 File is slaughtered from which we assume that it is started 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.110
 And this gap is invisible even if it does not even notice 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.479
 that we are wrong 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.580
 for example 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.710
 a file Skype revenue by six percent the one called the 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.899
 So party is a file next to the actual one 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.919
 Calculator modules have another file in the background with that starts 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.629
 We do not even see because just on our orders the calculator 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.929
 also on the monitor appears with me that you noticed because him a 

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:09.929
 completely different application was actually started 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:15.139
 At that time Microsoft was able to recognize this gap quite quickly 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.409
 However, they do not really react because of the architecture of Windows XP 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.930
 so far, the whole thing was only with Windows Vista 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.319
 clarified 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.319
 because they test once 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:38.719
 w
