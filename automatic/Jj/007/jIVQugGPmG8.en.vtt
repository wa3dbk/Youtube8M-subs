00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
so I'm not going to finish it off now

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.189 
so I'm not going to finish it off now
because<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:57.430> can't<00:05:58.430> really<00:05:58.729> do<00:05:59.150> it<00:05:59.210> now<00:05:59.569> and<00:05:59.870> I

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
because I can't really do it now and I

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.850

it'd<00:06:00.710> take<00:06:01.219> me<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.490> long<00:06:01.639> time<00:06:01.939> so<00:06:02.509> that's<00:06:03.500> just

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
it'd take me a long time so that's just

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:11.110 
it'd take me a long time so that's just
how<00:06:04.340> you<00:06:04.400> do<00:06:04.699> it<00:06:05.680> looks<00:06:06.680> like<00:06:06.919> this<00:06:07.189> and<00:06:10.120> so

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
how you do it looks like this and so

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.409
