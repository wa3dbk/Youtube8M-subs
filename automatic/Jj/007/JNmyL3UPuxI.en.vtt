00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.860 

so<00:06:45.110> let's<00:06:45.949> figure<00:06:46.189> out<00:06:46.340> what<00:06:46.699> is<00:06:46.819> behind<00:06:47.150> that

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
so let's figure out what is behind that

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.529 
so let's figure out what is behind that
tree<00:06:48.349> because<00:06:48.830> for<00:06:49.610> some<00:06:49.789> strange<00:06:50.120> reason<00:06:50.240> I

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
tree because for some strange reason I

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.179 
tree because for some strange reason I
am<00:06:50.629> very<00:06:50.870> interested<00:06:51.139> and<00:06:51.469> I<00:06:51.560> cannot<00:06:51.800> continue

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:52.189 
am very interested and I cannot continue

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.379 
am very interested and I cannot continue
or<00:06:52.699> I<00:06:52.729> could<00:06:52.849> not<00:06:52.969> finish<00:06:53.180> this<00:06:53.419> part<00:06:54.409> of<00:06:54.770> the

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
or I could not finish this part of the

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.390 
or I could not finish this part of the
playthrough<00:06:56.389> unless<00:06:57.319> I<00:06:57.500> figure<00:06:57.979> out<00:06:58.189> what's

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
playthrough unless I figure out what's

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.350 
playthrough unless I figure out what's
back<00:06:58.580> here<00:06:59.830> know<00:07:00.830> it<00:07:00.860> who<00:07:01.219> are<00:07:01.250> you<00:07:01.370> if<00:07:02.240> you
