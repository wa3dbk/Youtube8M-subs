00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
point where it bends oh like I just got

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.160 
point where it bends oh like I just got
this<00:01:31.140> padded<00:01:31.470> probably<00:01:32.750> called<00:01:33.750> months<00:01:33.960> ago

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this padded probably called months ago

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.249 
this padded probably called months ago
diamond<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:36.329> Sabine's<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.020> you'll<00:01:37.140> see

diamond in Sabine's and you'll see
instant<00:01:37.619> improvement<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:39.680> with

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
instant improvement because I'm with

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
instant improvement because I'm with
this<00:01:40.829> pad<00:01:41.070> give<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> mean<00:01:42.119> originally<00:01:42.600> you'd

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this pad give me I mean originally you'd

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
this pad give me I mean originally you'd
want<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> stay<00:01:43.170> facing<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> goalie<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
want to stay facing the goalie and you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.690 
want to stay facing the goalie and you
facing<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.689> UM<00:01:45.810> puck<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.799> puck<00:01:47.130> Arab<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
facing the UM puck the puck Arab and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.230 
facing the UM puck the puck Arab and
that's<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.570> usually<00:01:48.689> nope<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.320> somehow<00:01:49.649> I'm

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that's what usually nope if somehow I'm

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
that's what usually nope if somehow I'm
you<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.390> turned<00:01:51.570> around<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you get turned around there is how the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.740 
you get turned around there is how the
guards<00:01:53.329> hear<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.750> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
guards hear that and then I'm that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.649 
guards hear that and then I'm that
basically<00:01:58.049> goes<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.500> both<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> there's<00:01:59.460> no

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
basically goes for both and there's no

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.639 
basically goes for both and there's no
once<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> all

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
once you have it on you have it all

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.670 
once you have it on you have it all

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
adjusted there's no real bulk to it so

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.750 
adjusted there's no real bulk to it so

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
go down a butterfly what happens is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.200 
go down a butterfly what happens is
because<00:02:45.830> your<00:02:46.830> knee<00:02:47.100> actually<00:02:47.700> comes<00:02:47.910> out<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
