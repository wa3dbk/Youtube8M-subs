00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.110 
no no no no I think I'm going to go for
this<00:04:09.420> pack<00:04:10.170> I've<00:04:10.560> already<00:04:10.800> got<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.340> think<00:04:11.730> that

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
this pack I've already got I think that

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.740 
this pack I've already got I think that
that<00:04:12.150> I'm<00:04:12.540> not<00:04:12.780> or<00:04:13.050> maybe<00:04:13.110> just<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.250> that

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
that I'm not or maybe just that on that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.920 
that I'm not or maybe just that on that
but<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.230> used<00:04:15.590> them<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.100> ink<00:04:16.670> for<00:04:17.420> black<00:04:17.630> ink

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
but I used them for ink for black ink

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.130 
but I used them for ink for black ink
which<00:04:18.590> means<00:04:18.859> i<00:04:19.220> can't<00:04:20.150> use<00:04:20.359> them<00:04:20.570> again<00:04:20.840> for

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
which means i can't use them again for

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.070 
which means i can't use them again for
acrylic<00:04:22.070> paint<00:04:22.460> because<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:23.570> can<00:04:23.750> just<00:04:23.780> never

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
acrylic paint because you can just never

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.230 
acrylic paint because you can just never
get<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> black<00:04:24.560> ink<00:04:24.740> are<00:04:24.950> basically<00:04:25.550> so

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
get the black ink are basically so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.640 
get the black ink are basically so
that's<00:04:26.420> why<00:04:26.600> i<00:04:26.630> need<00:04:26.900> new<00:04:27.140> little<00:04:27.440> paint

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
that's why i need new little paint

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.290 
that's why i need new little paint
brushes<00:04:27.830> like<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.520> figure<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.090> might

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
brushes like that and I figure I might

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.000 
brushes like that and I figure I might
as<00:04:29.360> well<00:04:29.480> buy<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.750> same<00:04:29.990> one<00:04:30.050> soon<00:04:30.530> as<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.770> liked

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
as well buy the same one soon as I liked

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.620 
as well buy the same one soon as I liked
them<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.670> is<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.880> bigger<00:04:32.150> set<00:04:32.450> and

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
them and this is a bigger set and

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.660 
them and this is a bigger set and
there's<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.930> teeny<00:04:33.290> weeny<00:04:33.500> one<00:04:34.070> there<00:04:34.310> which<00:04:34.520> i

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
there's a teeny weeny one there which i

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.820 
there's a teeny weeny one there which i
think<00:04:34.730> would<00:04:34.940> come<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.270> handy<00:04:35.440> so<00:04:36.440> yeah<00:04:36.620> that's

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
think would come in handy so yeah that's

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.100 
think would come in handy so yeah that's
I'm<00:04:37.130> going<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.370> get<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.360> I'm<00:04:38.570> going<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.840> try

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.660 
and only by these three things I think
that's<00:04:43.400> probably<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:45.190> least<00:04:46.190> amount<00:04:46.550> of

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670
