00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
up like that and I guess you could use

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.800 
up like that and I guess you could use
this<00:04:54.890> for<00:04:54.950> wall<00:04:55.400> mounting<00:04:55.430> someway<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.420> don't

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
this for wall mounting someway I don't

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.790 
this for wall mounting someway I don't
know<00:04:56.930> how<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.140> works<00:04:57.790> this<00:04:58.790> says<00:04:59.090> right<00:04:59.300> here

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
know how that works this says right here

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.960 
know how that works this says right here
2003<00:05:00.800> Wow

short<00:05:23.750> so<00:05:23.870> it's<00:05:24.170> out<00:05:24.290> of<00:05:24.320> scale<00:05:24.650> but<00:05:25.040> you<00:05:25.280> know

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
short so it's out of scale but you know

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.210

this<00:05:25.970> toy<00:05:26.270> biz<00:05:26.540> cat<00:05:26.900> wolf<00:05:27.290> I<00:05:27.500> guess<00:05:27.680> his<00:05:27.920> legs

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
this toy biz cat wolf I guess his legs

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.080 
this toy biz cat wolf I guess his legs
could<00:05:28.430> be<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.550> little<00:05:28.760> closer<00:05:29.000> together<00:05:31.000> yeah<00:05:32.000> I

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
could be a little closer together yeah I

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.220 
could be a little closer together yeah I
guess<00:05:32.300> they're<00:05:32.450> closer<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.930> height<00:05:33.050> but

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
guess they're closer and height but

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.520 
guess they're closer and height but
still<00:05:33.590> it's<00:05:34.220> kind<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.880> lot<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.360> woman<00:05:35.630> so

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
still it's kind of a lot of woman so

it's<00:05:36.710> like<00:05:36.830> if<00:05:36.920> you<00:05:36.980> have<00:05:37.100> these<00:05:37.250> two<00:05:37.490> next<00:05:37.700> to

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
it's like if you have these two next to

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.470 
it's like if you have these two next to
each<00:05:37.910> other<00:05:39.340> kinda<00:05:40.340> doesn't<00:05:40.880> look<00:05:41.000> as<00:05:41.180> weird

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
each other kinda doesn't look as weird
