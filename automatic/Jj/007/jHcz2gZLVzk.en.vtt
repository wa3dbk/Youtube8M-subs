00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that's because these little microphones

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.050 
that's because these little microphones
are<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.189> fine<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:23.580> you're<00:00:23.760> doing

there but the s4 is had a bit of an
issue<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> unlike<00:00:59.070> most<00:00:59.449> phones<00:01:00.449> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
issue in the unlike most phones just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
issue in the unlike most phones just
simply<00:01:01.230> wouldn't<00:01:01.440> entertain<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:02.190> external

simply wouldn't entertain an external

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
simply wouldn't entertain an external
microphone<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> new<00:01:04.439> piece<00:01:04.619> of

microphone so there's a new piece of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.370 
microphone so there's a new piece of
software<00:01:04.830> come<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.600> by<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> guy<00:01:06.930> who's<00:01:07.170> been

while it's called cinema FV five and I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.539 
while it's called cinema FV five and I
just<00:01:14.909> discovered<00:01:15.590> when<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> looked<00:01:17.009> into<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
just discovered when I looked into it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.100 
just discovered when I looked into it
that<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.350> settings<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> 35<00:01:20.960> one<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that in the settings for a 35 one of the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
that in the settings for a 35 one of the
options<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.500> external<00:01:23.040> microphone<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.670> i

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
options is external microphone so i

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.640 
options is external microphone so i
thought<00:01:23.880> i<00:01:23.939> would<00:01:24.030> give<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.420> shot<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.530> i

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
thought i would give it a shot so if i

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.100 
thought i would give it a shot so if i
can<00:01:25.799> assure<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> were<00:01:26.780> fairly<00:01:27.780> cheap

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
can assure you were fairly cheap

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.219 
can assure you were fairly cheap
external<00:01:28.619> microphone<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.229> mappings

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
external microphone this is a mappings

external microphone this is a mappings
job<00:01:32.570> needs<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:34.590> hearing<00:01:35.250> aid<00:01:35.369> battery

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
job needs a little hearing aid battery

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.190 
job needs a little hearing aid battery
and<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:37.079> about<00:01:37.200> 20<00:01:37.590> pounds<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:39.200> standard

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and it's about 20 pounds if a standard

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.399 
and it's about 20 pounds if a standard
3.5<00:01:40.549> stereo<00:01:41.549> jack<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
3.5 stereo jack but it's the one with

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.830 
3.5 stereo jack but it's the one with
the<00:01:43.439> extra<00:01:43.860> pin<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.610> having<00:01:45.090> microphone<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the extra pin for having microphone and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
the extra pin for having microphone and
then<00:01:45.960> stereo<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> these

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then stereo so this is just one of these

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
then stereo so this is just one of these
gadgets<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.810> would<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.490> clip<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.670> there

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
gadgets that would just clip on there

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.859 
gadgets that would just clip on there
and<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.570> shatter<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.020> somebody<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
and you can shatter in somebody right so

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.670 
and you can shatter in somebody right so
let's<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.079> look<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> actually

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
let's have a look and see if it actually

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.130 
let's have a look and see if it actually
works<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.090> tell<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.630> it's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
works I have to tell you right now it's

of semi-professional video immediately
kills<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.750> piece<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.110> software<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.590> can

kills it this piece of software you can
turn<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.370> off<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:03.000> set<00:03:03.270> you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
turn all of that off so you can set you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.380 
turn all of that off so you can set you
focus<00:03:03.750> fix<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.320> set<00:03:05.070> your<00:03:05.190> light<00:03:05.340> levels<00:03:05.700> Dixon

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
focus fix it set your light levels Dixon

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.330 
focus fix it set your light levels Dixon
so<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.110> once<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> video<00:03:07.650> starts<00:03:08.160> they

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
so that once the video starts they

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190 
so that once the video starts they
remain<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:09.060> remain<00:03:09.420> fixed<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:09.990> want

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
remain they remain fixed and they want

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.220 
remain they remain fixed and they want
so<00:03:10.830> hunt<00:03:11.190> back<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.520> forward<00:03:11.850> all<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> time<00:03:12.330> so

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
so hunt back and forward all the time so

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.690 
so hunt back and forward all the time so
cinemark<00:03:14.010> v5<00:03:14.459> does<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.030> however<00:03:16.459> what<00:03:17.459> about

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
cinemark v5 does that however what about

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.390 
cinemark v5 does that however what about
external<00:03:18.120> mics<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.500> start<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.920> recording

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400

meter there and as you can see as I move
my<00:03:56.000> microphone<00:03:57.000> away<00:03:57.120> from<00:03:57.360> my<00:03:57.540> mouth<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
my microphone away from my mouth and

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.229 
my microphone away from my mouth and
it's<00:03:58.620> making<00:03:58.920> any<00:03:59.010> difference<00:03:59.220> whatsoever<00:03:59.610> is

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
it's making any difference whatsoever is

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.290 
it's making any difference whatsoever is
actually<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:00.930> taking<00:04:01.410> any<00:04:01.530> knows<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.300> so

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
actually not taking any knows of it so

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.060 
actually not taking any knows of it so
I've<00:04:03.720> been<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.160> designer<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.910> going<00:04:06.540> to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
I've been on to the designer is going to

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.890 
I've been on to the designer is going to
sort<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.280> however<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.910> did<00:04:09.120> find<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.750> by

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
sort it however I did find that by

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.949 
sort it however I did find that by
playing<00:04:10.260> around<00:04:10.560> with<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.769> connection<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.959> could

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
playing around with a connection I could

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.460 
playing around with a connection I could
get<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.380> work<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.750> there<00:04:15.750> as<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.080> can<00:04:16.260> see

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
get it to work and there as you can see

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.130 
get it to work and there as you can see
it's<00:04:16.620> made<00:04:16.799> no<00:04:17.010> difference<00:04:17.250> whatsoever<00:04:18.140> so

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
it's made no difference whatsoever so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.300 
it's made no difference whatsoever so
you<00:04:19.200> have<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.530> play<00:04:19.739> around<00:04:19.859> with<00:04:20.220> that

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
you have to play around with that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.190 
you have to play around with that
connection<00:04:20.850> until<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.270> kind<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.900> picks

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
connection until it kind of just picks

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.310 
connection until it kind of just picks
it<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.470> somehow<00:04:22.800> okay<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:24.000> am<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:25.110> cut<00:04:25.260> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
it up somehow okay so I am to cut the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.610 
it up somehow okay so I am to cut the
video<00:04:25.440> shot<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.070> because<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.370> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
video shot there because up to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.920 
video shot there because up to
bit<00:04:26.740> longer<00:04:26.949> than<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.340> expected<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:28.000> simply<00:04:28.810> by

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
bit longer than I expected but simply by

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.090 
bit longer than I expected but simply by
playing<00:04:29.229> around<00:04:29.410> with<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.620> connector<00:04:29.949> if<00:04:30.040> you

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
playing around with the connector if you

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.000 
playing around with the connector if you
looked<00:04:30.280> at<00:04:30.400> media<00:04:30.729> now<00:04:30.910> uh<00:04:31.389> if<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:32.380> if<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.800> told

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
looked at media now uh if I if I told

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.700 
looked at media now uh if I if I told
very<00:04:33.280> click<00:04:33.520> close<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.910> mic<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:35.229> can<00:04:35.440> see<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
very click close the mic you can see the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.740 
very click close the mic you can see the
media's<00:04:35.979> going<00:04:36.160> up<00:04:36.340> down<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.940> if<00:04:37.300> i<00:04:37.389> take<00:04:37.570> the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
media's going up down and if i take the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.990 
media's going up down and if i take the
microwave<00:04:38.199> then<00:04:38.500> we<00:04:38.620> get<00:04:38.800> no<00:04:39.040> longer<00:04:39.400> moves<00:04:39.790> up

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
microwave then we get no longer moves up

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.270 
microwave then we get no longer moves up
and<00:04:40.150> down<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.540> back<00:04:40.600> again<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.949> it's<00:04:42.070> working

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
and down and back again so it's working

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.750 
and down and back again so it's working
on<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.760> external<00:04:43.180> mic<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.440> we<00:04:45.340> guys<00:04:45.490> very

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
on the external mic so we guys very

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.460 
on the external mic so we guys very
helpful<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.330> would<00:04:46.449> keep<00:04:46.690> an<00:04:46.810> eye<00:04:46.930> out<00:04:46.960> for<00:04:47.139> this

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
helpful I would keep an eye out for this

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.770 
helpful I would keep an eye out for this
product<00:04:47.770> because<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.910> think<00:04:49.120> if<00:04:49.389> he<00:04:49.510> cracks

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
product because I think if he cracks

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.560 
product because I think if he cracks
this<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:51.250> private<00:04:51.550> works<00:04:51.729> over

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
this so that the private works over

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.360 
this so that the private works over
reliably<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.290> think<00:04:53.860> you've<00:04:53.979> got<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.190> good

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
reliably I think you've got a good

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.310 
reliably I think you've got a good
semi-professional<00:04:55.300> tool<00:04:55.540> therefore<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:56.199> you

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
semi-professional tool therefore if you

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.590 
semi-professional tool therefore if you
if<00:04:56.650> you're<00:04:56.830> out<00:04:57.040> and<00:04:57.070> about<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:58.090> need<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.449> do<00:04:58.570> a
