00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.180
 And here I am, here in the tutorial 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.099
 Mold wars and this video I go 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.440
 teach you the basic commands or 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.049
 tax disclosure and some 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.260
 basic controls for example let's 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 start with the tax is the physical gum 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.650
 basically for you to move the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.769
 ready objects you have something left 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.410
 the object can already move it 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.560
 for example here I'm messing with that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.239
 Airplane project was doing 16 20 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.380
 goals at 90 running 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 this difference points out that this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.450
 this alliance project check with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.090
 fiscal goose can move him drug to 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 ready against you think 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.260
 wd moves to see you thinking that damn 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 conditioned not conditioned in the area 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.289
 sure space flies 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.609
 you can have is also object by 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.520
 example how this house here you can 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 cross it here inside that house 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.100
 This is kind of like this, you can not 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.299
 into the house that matters is that this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:20.610
 once the doll there do not know why but it has 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:25.650
 so it's pretty cool that this bug there with 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.770
 left button can be played by 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.740
 a left button is safe here 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.400
 right of security of the right and will 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.189
 stop the object in the air also goes to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.250
 where you want, for example here I 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.640
 I left here so I leave there over and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 close with a break you can not 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.159
 move unless I have to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.210
 new in the same place 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.680
 the same piece and I made it ready this is the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.939
 fiscal is another physical thing is so the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.579
 I just want to tell him how secure he is. 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.979
 a mouse goes spinning it something else 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.140
 if your notebook does not have a mouse 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.869
 back and forth button is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.900
 insured is this happens can make the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.360
 same thing on the mouse ball 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.269
 That 's it, then. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.890
 rice menu is is the mouse woman 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.739
 cent ensuring nothing you can 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.739
 choose from weapons or we 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.660
 numbers above the keyboard are two 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:34.170
 revolvers three in right is four 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:39.900
 shocks and also has something close to 5 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.599
 grenade rpg is also without air 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.430
 another bullet and ready judges what 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:49.920
 It matters here, it's not judgment. 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.900
 judge I'm just going to teach you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.849
 whenever another video teaches how to 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.970
 use all the commands of the game is very 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.890
 thing playing here you basically going 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:07.590
 use this toolbar I 'm going to 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:14.930
 teach another video all our pressure 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.790
 Suar's zoar bath proof is to come back here 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.919
 here you can get here any 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.680
 object of construction restrictions 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:26.250
 positioning you can click 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.440
 for example flasks close to lam and with 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:36.200
 left button that object I just took 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:38.340
 well that's what I think okay 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.690
 feeling light because he has a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 lot of clinging mud 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.670
 this is also very heavy if you want 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.360
 causes this business to be used in a 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.209
 iron bar if our orange tree 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.019
 ready is all here and is used with 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.590
 physical wool weapons to the waters and those who 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:07.150
 developed if you wanted to pontificate 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.730
 the rain also of the office now does not judge 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.970
 If you are installing the classes 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:18.690
 a npc zhaxu that does not give to watch 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.690
 Spend well, thank you. 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:27.990
 and if in case he wants to kill the grenade 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.990
 in him and he runs away there is nothing at all 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.840
 You see that he uses these with his 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.919
 real skill or he will want 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.919
 kill you 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.300
 ready 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.330
 yours as the basics 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.050
 here are the vehicles button is it serves 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.050
 for many things 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.700
 Key Champion I installed this car 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.220
 It's going to have to be there. 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.720
 newspaper I advise to be original 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.349
 not only because it is better because it goes 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.880
 update itself moreover it will he 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.760
 It's better if you can play online 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.830
 need to install hamachi or anything 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.470
 he knocks 16 if he is in the promotion 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.289
 can still get him for four reais 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.510
 For god's sake I bought it for 4 to 1 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.080
 awareness for boleto still ready 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.860
 How to tighten up is to separate the car 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.189
 so you go faster it goes from the car is 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:34.389
 the law button giving advice to the routine 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:36.460
 for is is the action button, right? 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.150
 I can take, for example, a lightweight item 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.419
 kind of box with her with one is and only 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:48.389
 got it so it was ok guys these were 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.389
 the basic jarbas commands of r 18
