what's the point of having a rack there

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.729 
what's the point of having a rack there
because<00:02:32.150> he<00:02:32.239> can't<00:02:32.510> see<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.530> seats

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
down ah well there's good reason for

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.710 
down ah well there's good reason for
that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.330 
that
because<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.409> buy<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.860> these<00:02:37.040> you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
because when you buy one of these you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.949
