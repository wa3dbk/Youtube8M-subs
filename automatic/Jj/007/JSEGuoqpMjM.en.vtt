00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400
 a lightning strike has a huge hole Birgit Homburger the Basdorf church 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.419
 cracked 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.849
 Wreckage flew up to 150 meters 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.070
 when the lightning struck the church on Thursday at 18:48 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.929
 the church clock with exactly at this time by the impact stand 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.770
 miraculously, there was no fire in the timbers, and no one was through 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.849
 flying slate or wooden parts injured 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.920
 Neighbor JÃ¶rn Stapelfeld was just opposite the entrance of his restaurant 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 when the lightning struck with great force 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.910
 yes we Stormarner open door Ohnesorg carried a giant pop 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.840
 and then I myself must also be in the course we want to be a follower of the top 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.490
 Door set 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.390
 and we set the leadership of the earlier statements sold out Rome and 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.130
 it was just a rattle and 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.170
 madness 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.230
 the confirmation price of 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.860
 or 4 10 meters do not always share 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.120
 that's how it should be 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.780
 with the Korbacher aerial ladder 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.680
 in front of and firefighters and a roofer at the tower up around 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.270
 first picture of the damage 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.180
 Commune Brick Inspector Berthold Schreiber and his deputy Bernd 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.350
 Schenk derived the assignment from the environment of the church 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.410
 Security reasons was closed off wide-area 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.120
 such a violent lightning strike has ward off the chief of the feather before 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.570
 not yet experienced so if there can look back now we see that 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.480
 The entire roof has slid down, apparently it's just broken 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.330
 and that the roof is one that is open and the whole lifted 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.170
 Has 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.580
 Dachdeckermeister because of this brought to hamlet Hall has notion of the whole 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.480
 Series sound of the roofing you look at 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.960
 that is, percent that percent the problems closing the target audience 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.720
 is just as good as her collapse 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.570
 the danger of collapse the plant 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.220
 and that's why now shut off and become more and more professionals 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.260
 let it go around the whole thing 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.840
 to edit accordingly 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.460
 after an initial estimate at the site 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.340
 the damage moves in the six-digit range 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.910
 the masonry of the tower love but apparently from the consequences of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.360
 Lightning strike spared
