00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.700 
we've learned in the Naughty Dog method
of<00:01:47.740> true<00:01:48.070> character<00:01:48.520> development<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.180> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
of true character development and and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.140 
of true character development and and
characters<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.770> resonate<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.580> have<00:01:51.760> depth

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
characters that resonate and have depth

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.030 
characters that resonate and have depth
and<00:01:52.479> conflict<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.500> each<00:01:53.620> other<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.010> you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
and conflict with each other and you

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.530 
and conflict with each other and you
feel<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.700> tension<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.090> Joel<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.420> Ellie

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
feel that tension that Joel and Ellie

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.450 
feel that tension that Joel and Ellie
are<00:01:55.630> feeling<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.200> feel<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:57.190> pressure

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
are feeling and you feel that pressure

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.760 
are feeling and you feel that pressure
being<00:01:57.790> applied<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.120> them<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.350> you're<00:01:59.590> with

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
being applied to them in and you're with

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.560 
being applied to them in and you're with
them<00:02:00.040> moment<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> moment<00:02:00.729> because<00:02:01.299> you're

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
them moment to moment because you're

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.940 
them moment to moment because you're
they<00:02:01.869> are<00:02:01.930> trying<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.260> survive<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.890> like

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
they are trying to survive just like

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.340 
they are trying to survive just like
they<00:02:03.220> are<00:02:03.570> ultimately<00:02:04.570> what<00:02:04.780> we<00:02:04.900> want<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.229> do

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
they are ultimately what we want to do

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.380 
they are ultimately what we want to do
is<00:02:05.530> evoke<00:02:05.979> certain<00:02:06.190> emotions<00:02:06.760> from<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
is evoke certain emotions from the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.180 
is evoke certain emotions from the
player<00:02:07.630> from<00:02:07.840> people<00:02:08.140> playing<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.649> game<00:02:08.890> and

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
player from people playing this game and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.889 
player from people playing this game and
the<00:02:09.670> way<00:02:09.759> we<00:02:09.909> do<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.269> by<00:02:10.689> giving

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the way we do that is by giving

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.089 
the way we do that is by giving
characters<00:02:11.439> that<00:02:11.529> have<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.889> lot<00:02:12.069> of

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
characters that have a lot of

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.260 
characters that have a lot of
dimensionality<00:02:12.609> a<00:02:12.790> lot<00:02:13.090> of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
dimensionality a lot of

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.820 
dimensionality a lot of
depth<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.960> could<00:02:14.140> buy<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.440> they're<00:02:14.620> real

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
depth so you could buy that they're real

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.200 
depth so you could buy that they're real
people<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.400> are<00:02:15.490> forced<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.910> make<00:02:16.090> these

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
people that are forced to make these

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.970 
people that are forced to make these
difficult<00:02:16.780> choices<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.320> part<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.890> the

difficult choices and part of the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.100 
difficult choices and part of the
process<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.610> bringing<00:02:19.390> these<00:02:19.600> characters<00:02:19.990> of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
process of bringing these characters of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.470 
process of bringing these characters of
life<00:02:20.230> was<00:02:20.440> casting<00:02:20.980> join<00:02:21.910> Ashley<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> mean

at stake for these characters and that's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.310 
at stake for these characters and that's
kind<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> been<00:02:55.270> why<00:02:55.510> we've<00:02:55.840> approached

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
kind of been why we've approached

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.200 
kind of been why we've approached
tension<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.950> violence<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.430> such<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> realistic

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
tension and violence in such a realistic

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.070 
tension and violence in such a realistic
level<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:59.290> violence<00:02:59.860> is<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.700> show<00:03:01.420> you

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
level that violence is is to show you

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.410 
level that violence is is to show you
that<00:03:02.410> there<00:03:02.650> are<00:03:02.680> real<00:03:02.950> consequences<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.030> of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
that there are real consequences and of

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.210 
that there are real consequences and of
course<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.840> plays<00:03:05.080> into<00:03:05.110> strategies<00:03:05.860> for

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
course this plays into strategies for

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.950 
course this plays into strategies for
the<00:03:06.250> player<00:03:06.520> we're<00:03:07.300> giving<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.660> lot<00:03:07.780> more

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
the player we're giving a lot more

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.120 
the player we're giving a lot more
opportunities<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.650> probably<00:03:08.860> one<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
opportunities it's probably one of the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.770 
opportunities it's probably one of the
more<00:03:09.250> system<00:03:09.670> based<00:03:09.850> games<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.390> were<00:03:10.480> making

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
more system based games that were making

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.840 
more system based games that were making
here<00:03:10.900> at<00:03:10.990> Naughty<00:03:11.170> Dog<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:11.680> ever<00:03:12.040> so

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
here at Naughty Dog if ever so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.060 
here at Naughty Dog if ever so
everything<00:03:13.810> has<00:03:13.930> weight<00:03:14.170> everything<00:03:14.920> has

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
everything has weight everything has

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.460 
everything has weight everything has
consequence<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.880> then<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.210> allows<00:03:16.470> Joel

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
consequence and then that allows Joel

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.949 
consequence and then that allows Joel
and<00:03:17.620> Ellie<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:18.209> create<00:03:19.209> interesting<00:03:19.480> choices

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
and Ellie to create interesting choices

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.300 
and Ellie to create interesting choices
and<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.350> lets<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.920> as<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> player

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
and that lets you as the player

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.660 
and that lets you as the player
strategize<00:03:22.150> differently<00:03:22.690> throughout<00:03:22.990> uh

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
strategize differently throughout uh

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.820 
strategize differently throughout uh
actually<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:28.420> there's<00:03:28.930> been<00:03:29.230> at<00:03:29.380> least<00:03:29.410> four

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
actually I so there's been at least four

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.940 
actually I so there's been at least four
times<00:03:30.070> where<00:03:30.340> she's<00:03:30.370> hit<00:03:30.760> another<00:03:30.970> actor<00:03:31.950> one

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
times where she's hit another actor one
