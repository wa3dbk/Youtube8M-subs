00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
anyway today's LCD 10 this morning when

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.349 
anyway today's LCD 10 this morning when
I<00:00:15.030> woke<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:16.640> 162<00:00:17.640> pounds

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I woke up I was 162 pounds

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.720 
I woke up I was 162 pounds
I<00:00:18.590> started<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> hundred<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.189> seventy<00:00:20.699> two

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I started at a hundred and seventy two

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
I started at a hundred and seventy two
so<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.420> means<00:00:21.570> I've<00:00:21.720> lost<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.109> total<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.560> ten

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
so that means I've lost a total of ten

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.800 
so that means I've lost a total of ten
pounds<00:00:23.480> this<00:00:24.480> morning<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.109> lost<00:00:25.380> three<00:00:26.039> pounds

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
pounds this morning I lost three pounds

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.880 
pounds this morning I lost three pounds
but<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.140> explain<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> little<00:00:28.740> more

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
but I'm going to explain a little more

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.269 
but I'm going to explain a little more
about<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:30.179> minute<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:32.070> last

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
about that in a minute I think my last

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.270 
about that in a minute I think my last
check-in<00:00:32.579> date<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.120> when<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> had<00:00:33.719> my<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.980> zero

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
check-in date was when I had my my zero

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.360 
check-in date was when I had my my zero
day<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.780> yell<00:00:36.989> CD<00:00:37.320> five<00:00:37.590> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
day I think that was yell CD five so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.569 
day I think that was yell CD five so
after<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> lost<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:39.960> five<00:00:40.250> then<00:00:41.250> one

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
after that I lost point five then one

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.770 
after that I lost point five then one
point<00:00:41.820> five<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.620> LCD<00:00:44.129> nine

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
point five and then the LCD nine

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.160 
point five and then the LCD nine
yesterday<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.379> gained<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.460> pound<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
yesterday I gained a pound but I know it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.920 
yesterday I gained a pound but I know it
was<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.379> water<00:00:49.680> weight<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.219> thing<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
was just water weight the thing is I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.689 
was just water weight the thing is I
made<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> suit<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.440> myself<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.129> night<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
made a suit for myself that night that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.560 
made a suit for myself that night that
was<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.360> too<00:00:54.390> salty<00:00:55.550> really<00:00:56.550> salty<00:00:56.850> but

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
was just way too salty really salty but

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
was just way too salty really salty but
I<00:00:57.600> ate<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> had<00:00:58.739> made<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
I ate it because I had made it and so I

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.819 
I ate it because I had made it and so I
think<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.870> why<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> was<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> whole<00:01:01.620> pound

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
think that's why I was up a whole pound

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.210 
think that's why I was up a whole pound
so<00:01:02.640> anyway<00:01:03.120> yesterday<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.589> tried<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so anyway yesterday I tried to do a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
so anyway yesterday I tried to do a
couple<00:01:05.549> things<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.970> counteract<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.600> which

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
couple things to counteract that which

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.420 
couple things to counteract that which
led<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.130> three<00:01:08.430> pounds<00:01:08.790> loss<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.220> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
led to my three pounds loss and that is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.600 
led to my three pounds loss and that is
I<00:01:11.670> did<00:01:12.030> drink<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> cup<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.979> dieters<00:01:13.979> tea<00:01:14.310> last

did that and I laid in there for just

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
did that and I laid in there for just
like<00:01:34.619> 15<00:01:35.009> minutes<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:36.240> anyway<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.979> definitely

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
like 15 minutes but anyway it definitely

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
like 15 minutes but anyway it definitely
did<00:01:39.240> its<00:01:39.420> work<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.619> morning<00:01:41.100> I've

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
did its work because this morning I've

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.280 
did its work because this morning I've
never<00:01:41.790> had<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> three<00:01:42.240> pound<00:01:42.479> loss<00:01:42.659> yet<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.110> far

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
never had a three pound loss yet so far

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
never had a three pound loss yet so far
usually<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> lose<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> most<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
usually you lose the most at the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.480 
usually you lose the most at the
beginning<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.750> I've<00:01:45.869> never<00:01:46.020> I've<00:01:46.829> never<00:01:47.130> even

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
beginning and I've never I've never even

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.730 
beginning and I've never I've never even
lost<00:01:47.729> two<00:01:47.939> pounds<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.509> three<00:01:49.110> pounds<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.500> great

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
lost two pounds so three pounds is great

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.520 
lost two pounds so three pounds is great
I<00:01:50.100> am<00:01:50.850> assuming<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.259> least

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I am assuming this you know at least

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.280 
I am assuming this you know at least
some<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.189> water<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.780> sure<00:01:55.049> if

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
some of that is water so I'm not sure if

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.789 
some of that is water so I'm not sure if
tomorrow<00:01:55.920> maybe<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.549> might<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.420> zero<00:01:58.110> or<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
tomorrow maybe I might have a zero or I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
tomorrow maybe I might have a zero or I
might<00:01:59.130> even<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> small<00:01:59.820> gain<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.299> not
