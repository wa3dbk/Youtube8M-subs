be mounted on a little clip so it's
versatile<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.620> by<00:01:41.460> turning

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
versatile you can actually by turning

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.730 
versatile you can actually by turning
this<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.390> change<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.840> angle<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.260> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
