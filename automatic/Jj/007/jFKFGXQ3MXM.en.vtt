I'm<00:03:21.440> satisfied<00:03:21.710> with<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.400> guess<00:03:22.460> for<00:03:22.880> now<00:03:23.290> back

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290

I'm satisfied with I guess for now back
to<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.710> rest<00:03:24.920> my<00:03:25.130> shop<00:03:25.340> maybe<00:03:25.550> I'll<00:03:25.760> do<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.000> a

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
to the rest my shop maybe I'll do it a

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.170 
to the rest my shop maybe I'll do it a
second<00:03:26.420> time<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:27.160> really<00:03:28.160> recommend<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.760> I
