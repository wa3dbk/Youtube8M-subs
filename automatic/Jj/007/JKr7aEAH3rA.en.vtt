00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
want to go zero to 60 and so I'm about

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
want to go zero to 60 and so I'm about
to<00:00:26.939> show<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.480> here's<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> crazy<00:00:28.050> part

there is no such thing as the definitive

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
there is no such thing as the definitive
zero<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> 60<00:00:32.070> time<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.059> episode<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
zero to 60 time and on this episode of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600 
zero to 60 time and on this episode of
the<00:00:33.750> fast<00:00:33.989> lane<00:00:34.140> car<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:35.100> gonna<00:00:35.309> prove<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.689 

so<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:58.840> looked<00:00:59.050> up<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.260> 0<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.890> 60<00:01:00.219> time<00:01:00.430> for<00:01:00.640> this

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
so I looked up the 0 to 60 time for this

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.150 
so I looked up the 0 to 60 time for this
Mitsubishi<00:01:01.300> Lancer<00:01:01.449> in<00:01:02.170> three<00:01:02.800> different

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
Mitsubishi Lancer in three different

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.310 
Mitsubishi Lancer in three different
locations<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.119> I<00:01:04.210> got<00:01:04.390> seven<00:01:04.839> point<00:01:05.110> five

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
locations and I got seven point five

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680 
locations and I got seven point five
seven<00:01:06.070> point<00:01:06.430> seven<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.970> even<00:01:07.299> on<00:01:07.420> one<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
seven point seven and even on one of the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.330 
seven point seven and even on one of the
forms<00:01:08.020> seven<00:01:08.830> point<00:01:09.280> nine<00:01:09.899> why<00:01:10.899> is<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.440> reason

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
forms seven point nine why is it reason

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.190 
forms seven point nine why is it reason
is<00:01:12.460> simple<00:01:12.790> there<00:01:13.060> are<00:01:13.090> too<00:01:13.509> many<00:01:13.750> variables

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
is simple there are too many variables

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.430 
is simple there are too many variables
when<00:01:14.890> doing<00:01:15.190> a<00:01:15.310> zero<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.640> 60<00:01:15.909> time<00:01:16.200> last<00:01:17.200> time

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
when doing a zero to 60 time last time

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.139 
when doing a zero to 60 time last time
we<00:01:17.560> tested<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:18.039> car<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.490> reviewed<00:01:18.789> it<00:01:18.880> we

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
we tested this car and reviewed it we

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.550 
we tested this car and reviewed it we
got<00:01:19.390> well<00:01:19.810> why<00:01:19.960> don't<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.140> watch<00:01:20.320> for

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
got well why don't you watch for

already named the ad let's go go here we
go<00:01:31.149> I've<00:01:31.690> got<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.080> stopwatch<00:01:32.289> and<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.490> CVT<00:01:34.240> is

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
go I've got the stopwatch and the CVT is

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.749 
go I've got the stopwatch and the CVT is
doing<00:01:35.259> its<00:01:35.380> best<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.800> mimic<00:01:36.069> a<00:01:36.369> standard

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
doing its best to mimic a standard

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.609 
doing its best to mimic a standard
transmission<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:37.780> know<00:01:37.929> it<00:01:38.080> ain't

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
transmission but we know it ain't

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.289 
transmission but we know it ain't
oh<00:01:42.429> there<00:01:43.429> we<00:01:43.520> have<00:01:43.609> it<00:01:43.700> folks<00:01:43.729> read<00:01:44.119> em<00:01:44.210> and

oh there we have it folks read em and
weep<00:01:44.390> eleven<00:01:45.380> point<00:01:45.710> five<00:01:46.009> seconds<00:01:46.759> that's

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
weep eleven point five seconds that's

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.370 
weep eleven point five seconds that's
what<00:01:47.210> not<00:01:47.450> having<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.750> turbo<00:01:48.020> does<00:01:48.200> that

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
what not having a turbo does that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.800 
what not having a turbo does that
altitude<00:01:49.130> yeah<00:01:49.789> you<00:01:50.090> know<00:01:50.210> what<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.630> wasn't

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
altitude yeah you know what that wasn't

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.770 
altitude yeah you know what that wasn't
too<00:01:51.049> bad<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.289> wonder<00:01:51.939> no<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:52.969> don't<00:01:53.210> wonder<00:01:53.390> it's

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
too bad I wonder no I don't wonder it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.199 
too bad I wonder no I don't wonder it's
just<00:01:53.990> low<00:01:54.170> it's<00:01:54.500> not<00:01:54.560> very<00:01:54.770> good<00:01:55.000> yeah<00:01:56.000> with

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
just low it's not very good yeah with

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.569 
just low it's not very good yeah with
this<00:01:56.299> massive<00:01:56.659> spoiler<00:01:57.439> it<00:01:57.649> may<00:01:57.979> look<00:01:58.250> like<00:01:58.280> an

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
this massive spoiler it may look like an

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.730 
this massive spoiler it may look like an
Evo<00:01:58.729> but<00:01:58.969> with<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.149> zero<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.659> 60<00:01:59.959> time<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.439> over

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
Evo but with a zero to 60 time of over

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.520 
Evo but with a zero to 60 time of over
11<00:02:01.520> seconds<00:02:01.880> up<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.240> at<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.750> mile<00:02:03.200> above<00:02:03.469> sea

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
11 seconds up here at a mile above sea

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.169 
11 seconds up here at a mile above sea
level<00:02:03.799> it's<00:02:04.189> certainly<00:02:04.549> not<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:04.969> there's<00:02:05.090> a

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
level it's certainly not and there's a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:06.370 
level it's certainly not and there's a
reason<00:02:05.479> for<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.689> there<00:02:05.840> are<00:02:05.990> too<00:02:06.200> many

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
reason for that there are too many

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.400 
reason for that there are too many
variables<00:02:06.729> when<00:02:07.729> doing<00:02:08.060> these<00:02:08.209> zero<00:02:09.049> to<00:02:09.140> sixty

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
variables when doing these zero to sixty

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.059 
variables when doing these zero to sixty
times<00:02:09.649> including<00:02:10.569> altitude<00:02:11.569> air<00:02:12.290> temperature

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
times including altitude air temperature

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.620 
times including altitude air temperature
how<00:02:13.340> many<00:02:13.489> people<00:02:13.730> are<00:02:13.819> in<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> car<00:02:14.180> how<00:02:14.480> much

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
how many people are in the car how much

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.600 
how many people are in the car how much
gas<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.349> car<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.950> type<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.190> surface

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
gas is in the car the type of surface

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.280 
gas is in the car the type of surface
you're<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.910> that's<00:02:17.360> why<00:02:17.599> they're<00:02:17.810> all<00:02:18.019> over

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you're on that's why they're all over

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.449 
you're on that's why they're all over
the<00:02:18.380> place<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.799> good<00:02:18.950> thing<00:02:19.130> about<00:02:19.160> this

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
the place and the good thing about this

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.220 
the place and the good thing about this
car<00:02:19.519> is<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:20.390> actually<00:02:20.660> change<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.200> of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
car is it can actually change one of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.690 
car is it can actually change one of
those<00:02:21.349> variables<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.340> two-wheel

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
those variables it can be in two-wheel

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.690 
those variables it can be in two-wheel
drive<00:02:23.000> or<00:02:23.269> four-wheel<00:02:23.930> drive<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.980> we're<00:02:25.610> gonna

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
drive or four-wheel drive so we're gonna

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.009 
drive or four-wheel drive so we're gonna
keep<00:02:25.849> it<00:02:26.000> simple<00:02:26.060> we're<00:02:26.360> gonna<00:02:26.480> do<00:02:26.599> two<00:02:26.780> zero

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
keep it simple we're gonna do two zero

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.600 
keep it simple we're gonna do two zero
to<00:02:27.079> sixty<00:02:27.379> runs<00:02:27.590> one<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.040> two-wheel<00:02:28.310> drive

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
to sixty runs one and two-wheel drive

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.490 
to sixty runs one and two-wheel drive
and<00:02:28.879> one<00:02:29.030> four-wheel<00:02:29.510> drive<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and one four-wheel drive and see the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.410 
and one four-wheel drive and see the
difference

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.850

Impala wheel drive I suspect the bills
slower<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.940> answer<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.420> there<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.900> have

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
slower and the answer is there you have

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.120 
slower and the answer is there you have
a<00:03:31.700> 10.8<00:03:32.700> for<00:03:33.590> just<00:03:34.590> another<00:03:34.980> variable<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:36.569> a
