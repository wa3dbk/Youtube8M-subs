00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
sticking in the same way and even a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660 
sticking in the same way and even a

possibility could go him he could go

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.090 
possibility could go him he could go
down<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:30.420> Borton<00:03:30.900> definitely<00:03:31.440> will<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.859> going

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
disagree with that then because it is a

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.789 
disagree with that then because it is a
massive<00:03:39.810> job<00:03:40.109> but<00:03:40.290> let<00:03:40.440> me<00:03:40.470> know<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:40.709> you
