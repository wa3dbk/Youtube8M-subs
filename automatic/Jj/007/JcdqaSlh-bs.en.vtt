00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
straps I just didn't want to be in that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:14.349 
straps I just didn't want to be in that
position<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.970> didn't<00:03:03.480> want<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.780> back<00:03:03.989> up<00:03:08.660> I

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.590 

guess<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.540> was<00:03:15.690> open<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.200> don't<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:18.000> don't<00:03:18.209> want<00:03:18.510> to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
guess I was open I don't I don't want to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.979 
guess I was open I don't I don't want to
be<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.930> breast<00:03:19.200> person<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:20.180> think<00:03:21.180> you

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
be the breast person but I think you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.380 
be the breast person but I think you
should<00:03:22.170> probably<00:03:22.350> do<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.730> I'm<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> bit<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.209> a

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
should probably do but I'm a bit of a

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.490 
should probably do but I'm a bit of a
melancholy<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:27.299> can<00:03:27.510> google<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.320> you're

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
melancholy you can google that if you're

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.780 
melancholy you can google that if you're
not<00:03:28.620> sure<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:30.799> basically<00:03:31.799> we're<00:03:32.250> real<00:03:32.430> artsy

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
not sure but basically we're real artsy

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.180 
not sure but basically we're real artsy
people<00:03:35.840> instead<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.900> being<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.290> pessimist<00:03:37.829> i'm

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
people instead of being a pessimist i'm

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.550 
people instead of being a pessimist i'm
more<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.670> realist<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.540> guess<00:03:40.230> that's<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
more of a realist I guess that's the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.699 
more of a realist I guess that's the
best<00:03:40.620> way<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.010> put<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.480> my<00:03:42.480> moods<00:03:42.780> fluctuating

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
best way to put it my moods fluctuating

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.860 
best way to put it my moods fluctuating
greatly<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:45.799> my<00:03:46.799> mama<00:03:47.040> used<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.459> say<00:03:47.720> if<00:03:48.720> you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
greatly and my mama used to say if you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.569 
greatly and my mama used to say if you
don't<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.440> mood<00:03:49.590> she's<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:49.859> give<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.519> a

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
don't like the mood she's in give it a

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.520 
don't like the mood she's in give it a
few<00:03:50.609> seconds<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.450> she'll<00:03:51.810> be<00:03:51.930> in<00:03:52.049> another<00:03:52.230> one

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
few seconds and she'll be in another one

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.400 
few seconds and she'll be in another one
I<00:03:53.000> guess<00:03:54.000> that's<00:03:54.239> true<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.230> why

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
I guess that's true and that's why

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.250 
I guess that's true and that's why
though<00:03:55.709> this<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.519> passing

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
though this is just a passing

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.559 
though this is just a passing
frustration<00:03:58.260> for<00:03:58.500> me<00:03:59.299> passing<00:04:00.299> bit<00:04:00.450> of

frustration for me passing bit of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.229 
frustration for me passing bit of

up

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
up

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.880 
up
and<00:04:05.340> it'll<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.670> better<00:04:05.909> but<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.989> for<00:04:07.170> now<00:04:07.200> I'm
