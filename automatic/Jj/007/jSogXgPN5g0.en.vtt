00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.110
 Hi today we are going to teach you to make a 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.389
 contests like these to introduce the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.950
 rice at weddings and be able to distribute 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.440
 what do we need 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.600
 some soft neurons that size more 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.380
 or less 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.230
 In addition metallized cardboards or so 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.200
 in my case it is silver and pulls 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.130
 gift ribbon and also some 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.130
 scissors and a pencil 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.120
 the first step is to turn a corner 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.360
 to take the measure on the side more 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.500
 long 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 with stinks 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.520
 and then we will have to mark a more arc 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.520
 or less 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.000
 on one side of the side that we have marked 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.000
 to the corner 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.650
 and then we cut it out like that and then what 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.390
 we cut 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.640
 we have already cut it 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.640
 we have to make a roll like that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.789
 and hit me all on the sidewalk 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.840
 you see so we have to paste the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.370
 next step is to put the lace on top 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.750
 and it does too 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.750
 with her 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.960
 and we paste it with another chunk 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.510
 Pablo does not have to be like that 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.909
 and then 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.000
 one of these silver gift 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.260
 Now that you want more beautiful 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.260
 what we do in the end 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.549
 with scissors 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.280
 we can curl a bit 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.500
 we already have suns with the very pretty ones 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.739
 to be able to throw it in the race the boyfriends 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.310
