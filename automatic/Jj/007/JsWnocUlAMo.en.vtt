guys<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.710> agree<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.579> aids

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
guys I actually agree but I think aids

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.719 
guys I actually agree but I think aids
if<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.059> rated<00:01:03.270> already<00:01:04.229> 6<00:01:04.589> rated<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.040> actually

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
if I rated already 6 rated is actually

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.179 
if I rated already 6 rated is actually
pretty<00:01:05.939> fair<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.170> reason<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.619> swayed

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
pretty fair but the reason I was swayed

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.330 
pretty fair but the reason I was swayed
to<00:01:08.220> 85<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:09.930> 85<00:01:10.799> rated<00:01:11.220> on

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to 85 is it actually 85 rated on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.450 
to 85 is it actually 85 rated on
head-to-head<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> moment<00:01:12.750> he<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.770> often

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
head-to-head at the moment he have often

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.210 
head-to-head at the moment he have often
gone<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:15.420> those<00:01:15.540> ratings<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> comes<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
gone for those ratings when it comes to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
gone for those ratings when it comes to
the<00:01:17.340> new<00:01:17.460> games<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.030> does<00:01:18.210> happen<00:01:18.509> quite<00:01:19.080> often

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the new games it does happen quite often

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.510 
the new games it does happen quite often
so<00:01:19.850> I'm<00:01:20.990> thinking<00:01:21.990> 85<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.799> 86<00:01:22.920> let<00:01:23.340> me<00:01:23.430> know

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so I'm thinking 85 or 86 let me know

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
so I'm thinking 85 or 86 let me know
what<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> guys<00:01:23.850> think<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.750> might<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.020> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
what you guys think but it might be a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.420 
what you guys think but it might be a
bit<00:01:25.200> harsh<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> stats<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.250> wasn't

his<00:03:00.680> dribbling<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.250> don't<00:03:01.490> think<00:03:01.730> they'll

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
his dribbling I don't think they'll

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.260

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
change up because 93 seems very very

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.510 
change up because 93 seems very very
good<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.050> can't<00:03:06.620> see<00:03:06.770> them<00:03:06.920> moving<00:03:07.130> out<00:03:07.370> to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
good and I can't see them moving out to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.970 
good and I can't see them moving out to
an<00:03:07.580> 84<00:03:07.970> or<00:03:08.000> even<00:03:08.510> downgrading<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.320> 92<00:03:09.740> so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
an 84 or even downgrading it to a 92 so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.920 
an 84 or even downgrading it to a 92 so
that'll<00:03:10.670> stay<00:03:10.850> about<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.090> same<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.510> rest<00:03:11.720> I

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
that'll stay about the same the rest I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.450 
that'll stay about the same the rest I
think<00:03:12.440> we'll<00:03:12.590> stay<00:03:12.770> about<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:12.980> same<00:03:13.070> as<00:03:13.340> or

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
think we'll stay about the same as or

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.190 
think we'll stay about the same as or
