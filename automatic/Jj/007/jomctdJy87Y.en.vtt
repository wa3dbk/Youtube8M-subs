view but to give them a goal or a target

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
view but to give them a goal or a target
so<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.659> something<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.200> focus<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.770> about

making their lives better it costs the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.469 
making their lives better it costs the
industry<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> wrong<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> do

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
industry more to do it wrong than to do

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.960 
industry more to do it wrong than to do
it<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.140> once<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.159> figure<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> out

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it right so once they figure that out

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.370 
it right so once they figure that out
they<00:01:18.150> start<00:01:18.450> doing<00:01:18.600> things<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.320> way

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
they start doing things the right way

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760 
they start doing things the right way
