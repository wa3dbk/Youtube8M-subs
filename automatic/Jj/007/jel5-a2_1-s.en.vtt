season probably not I mean we wish it
this<00:03:29.040> season<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.669> and<00:03:29.909> we'll<00:03:30.569> probably<00:03:30.750> could

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
this season but and we'll probably could

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.719 
this season but and we'll probably could
look<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.290> bring<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.709> some<00:03:31.889> fresh<00:03:32.099> faces<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.639> the

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
look to bring in some fresh faces in the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.750 
look to bring in some fresh faces in the

summer and could not necessary force him
out<00:03:35.879> but<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.209> think<00:03:36.659> he's<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.959> pools<00:03:37.199> plans

out but I think he's in the pools plans
but<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.250> won't<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.579> as<00:03:38.819> much<00:03:39.120> as<00:03:40.189> inhere

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
but it won't be as much as inhere
