tolerant<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:27.190> helps<00:02:27.610> me<00:02:27.790> plan<00:02:28.030> my<00:02:28.390> crap

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
tolerant and that helps me plan my crap

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.160 
tolerant and that helps me plan my crap
and<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:31.000> try<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:32.680> really<00:02:33.340> different

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and we try to have really different

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.690 
and we try to have really different
kinds<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.290> seeds<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.740> varieties<00:02:36.250> things<00:02:36.520> that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
kinds of seeds and varieties things that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.210 
kinds of seeds and varieties things that
you<00:02:36.820> don't<00:02:36.970> find<00:02:37.240> in<00:02:37.420> other<00:02:37.570> places<00:02:38.220> obscure

you don't find in other places obscure

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.210 
you don't find in other places obscure

get a pumpkin ready for Halloween in a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.300 
get a pumpkin ready for Halloween in a
perfect<00:02:50.170> year<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:50.590> aren't<00:02:50.770> any<00:02:50.920> perfect

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
perfect year there aren't any perfect

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.920 
perfect year there aren't any perfect
years<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.610> farming<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.270> perfect<00:02:52.720> year

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
years in farming but in a perfect year

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.500 
years in farming but in a perfect year
how<00:02:53.410> would<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:53.770> get<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.850> perfect

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
how would we get that that perfect

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.940 
how would we get that that perfect
pumpkin<00:02:55.690> let's<00:02:56.110> say<00:02:56.290> three<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:56.590> four<00:02:56.830> days

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
pumpkin let's say three or four days

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.190 
pumpkin let's say three or four days
before<00:02:57.520> Halloween<00:02:57.970> what's<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> process<00:02:59.020> when

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
before Halloween what's the process when

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.610 
before Halloween what's the process when
do<00:02:59.320> you<00:02:59.410> start<00:02:59.709> we<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:01.780> order<00:03:02.230> our<00:03:02.350> seed

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
do you start we actually order our seed

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.070 
do you start we actually order our seed
in<00:03:02.739> December<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:03.730> year<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.209> i<00:03:04.660> will<00:03:04.959> be

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
in December so this year and i will be

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.650 
in December so this year and i will be
ordering<00:03:05.320> scene<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.160> december<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:07.360> way

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
ordering scene in december and that way

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.130 
ordering scene in december and that way
I<00:03:07.690> know<00:03:07.959> what<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> have<00:03:08.890> planned

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I know what I have planned

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
I know what I have planned
plan<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.280> whole<00:03:11.670> planting<00:03:12.300> process

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
plan out the whole planting process

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.020 
plan out the whole planting process
because<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.410> course<00:03:13.650> different<00:03:14.069> kinds

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
because of course different kinds

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.660 
because of course different kinds
varieties<00:03:15.569> need<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> different<00:03:16.170> population<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
varieties need a different population a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.230 
varieties need a different population a
different<00:03:18.000> rate<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.330> seating<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.090> will

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
different rate of seating and so we will

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.860 
different rate of seating and so we will
plant<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.350> first<00:03:22.560> week<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.920> june<00:03:23.160> and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
plant about the first week of june and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.180 
plant about the first week of june and
then<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:25.910> probably<00:03:26.910> by<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.630> time<00:03:27.990> we<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.070> to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
then we probably by the time we have to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.820 
then we probably by the time we have to
be<00:03:29.310> very<00:03:29.520> careful<00:03:29.850> or<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.870> insects<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.620> be

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
be very careful or the insects can be

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.290 
be very careful or the insects can be
really<00:03:32.610> difficult<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.240> curb<00:03:33.630> its<00:03:34.220> are

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
really difficult that you curb its are

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.199 
really difficult that you curb its are
plagued<00:03:36.300> by<00:03:36.420> cucumber<00:03:37.020> beetles<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.580> we

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
plagued by cucumber beetles and so we

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.390 
plagued by cucumber beetles and so we
will<00:03:39.390> maybe<00:03:39.660> have<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.500> spray<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.920> pumpkins

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
will maybe have to spray the pumpkins

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.310 
will maybe have to spray the pumpkins
for<00:03:42.980> for<00:03:43.980> insects<00:03:44.450> within<00:03:45.450> three<00:03:45.780> weeks<00:03:45.959> of

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
for for insects within three weeks of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.310 
for for insects within three weeks of
them<00:03:46.500> coming<00:03:47.400> out<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.940> leave<00:03:48.120> stage<00:03:48.450> so

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
them coming out of the to leave stage so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.290 
them coming out of the to leave stage so
we<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.370> spray<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.910> we<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.180> watch

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
we have to spray and we have to watch

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.479 
we have to spray and we have to watch
for<00:03:51.330> powdery<00:03:51.810> mildew<00:03:52.200> fungus<00:03:52.470> ins<00:03:52.860> diseases

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
for powdery mildew fungus ins diseases

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.800 
for powdery mildew fungus ins diseases
so<00:03:54.470> probably<00:03:55.470> every<00:03:55.830> 10<00:03:56.130> days<00:03:56.370> we're<00:03:57.269> watching

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
so probably every 10 days we're watching

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.810 
so probably every 10 days we're watching
those<00:03:58.170> pumpkins<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:58.920> don't<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.459> spray

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
those pumpkins and you don't just spray

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.640 
those pumpkins and you don't just spray
by<00:04:00.030> hand<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:00.450> also<00:04:00.540> spray<00:04:00.959> with<00:04:01.110> helicopters

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
by hand you also spray with helicopters

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.979 
by hand you also spray with helicopters
now<00:04:01.800> yes<00:04:02.100> yes<00:04:02.550> which<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:03.000> wonderful

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
now yes yes which is a wonderful

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.500 
now yes yes which is a wonderful
development<00:04:04.200> because<00:04:05.239> typically<00:04:06.239> we<00:04:06.480> would

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
development because typically we would

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.540 
development because typically we would
go<00:04:06.840> through<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.320> field<00:04:07.530> with<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.800> tractor<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.459> a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
go through the field with a tractor in a

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.110 
go through the field with a tractor in a
sprayer<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:08.850> now<00:04:09.360> with<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.080> help<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.590> our

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
sprayer and now with the help of our

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.280 
sprayer and now with the help of our
helicopter<00:04:12.120> friend<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.540> don't<00:04:12.780> ruin<00:04:13.050> as<00:04:13.260> many

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
helicopter friend we don't ruin as many

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.890 
helicopter friend we don't ruin as many
vines<00:04:13.709> or<00:04:14.040> cracksman<00:04:14.940> pumpkins<00:04:15.420> before

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
vines or cracksman pumpkins before

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.199 
vines or cracksman pumpkins before
before<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.650> get<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.919> harvest<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.729> appreciate

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
before we get to harvest we appreciate

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.449 
before we get to harvest we appreciate
that<00:04:18.239> weather-wise<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> perfect<00:04:20.280> pumpkin

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that weather-wise at a perfect pumpkin

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.009 
that weather-wise at a perfect pumpkin
growing<00:04:20.850> year<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.239> would<00:04:21.359> have<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> little<00:04:21.870> bit

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
growing year you would have a little bit

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.469 
growing year you would have a little bit
of<00:04:22.049> rain<00:04:22.229> at<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.440> beginning<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.010> throughout

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
of rain at the beginning and throughout

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.520 
of rain at the beginning and throughout
yeah<00:04:24.479> we<00:04:24.960> need<00:04:25.169> we<00:04:25.740> need<00:04:26.930> constant<00:04:27.930> kind<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.410> a

yeah we need we need constant kind of a
rain<00:04:30.260> schedule<00:04:31.260> it's<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.490> hard<00:04:32.700> in<00:04:32.850> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
rain schedule it's very hard in the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.270 
rain schedule it's very hard in the
pumpkins<00:04:33.360> when<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:34.050> when<00:04:34.560> we<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:34.979> dry

to really be able to scout your field
and<00:04:57.960> when<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.140> say<00:04:58.260> scalp<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.979> field<00:04:59.220> that

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
and when I say scalp the field that

at the plants and watching for diseases

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.290 
at the plants and watching for diseases
because<00:05:07.020> pumpkins<00:05:07.740> are<00:05:08.010> very<00:05:08.400> susceptible<00:05:08.669> to

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
because pumpkins are very susceptible to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.350 
because pumpkins are very susceptible to
lots<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.780> different

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
so to have a good awareness for things

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.179 
so to have a good awareness for things
to<00:05:15.129> be<00:05:15.189> very<00:05:15.550> observant<00:05:15.969> take<00:05:16.870> your<00:05:17.050> time<00:05:17.379> not

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
to be very observant take your time not

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.320 
to be very observant take your time not
just<00:05:18.460> plow<00:05:19.300> through<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.780> field<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.259> look<00:05:20.830> at

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
just plow through the field and look at

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.600 
just plow through the field and look at
perhaps<00:05:22.330> maybe<00:05:22.659> you<00:05:22.960> will<00:05:23.169> find<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:24.009> eggs<00:05:24.340> of

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
perhaps maybe you will find the eggs of

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.309 
perhaps maybe you will find the eggs of
a<00:05:24.729> squash<00:05:25.270> beetle<00:05:25.659> or<00:05:25.750> something<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.229> the

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
a squash beetle or something on the

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.020 
a squash beetle or something on the
underside<00:05:26.710> of<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.889> plant<00:05:27.189> so<00:05:27.819> those<00:05:28.000> are

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
underside of a plant so those are

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.809 
underside of a plant so those are
important<00:05:28.870> skills<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.770> be<00:05:29.889> very<00:05:30.159> observant<00:05:30.490> to

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
important skills to be very observant to

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.510 
important skills to be very observant to
be<00:05:30.909> patient<00:05:31.240> earlier<00:05:32.129> when<00:05:33.129> we<00:05:33.159> were<00:05:33.250> out<00:05:33.430> in

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
be patient earlier when we were out in

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.709 
be patient earlier when we were out in
the<00:05:33.550> field<00:05:33.610> we<00:05:33.969> were<00:05:34.060> talking<00:05:34.360> about<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.689> know

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
the field we were talking about you know

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.659 
the field we were talking about you know

if you had a if you've had a
technological<00:05:37.569> improvement<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:38.620> might<00:05:38.830> be

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
technological improvement that might be

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.159 
technological improvement that might be
a<00:05:38.979> pumpkin<00:05:39.430> planter<00:05:39.969> have<00:05:40.479> a<00:05:40.599> pumpkin<00:05:40.930> plant

they are planted as we mentioned before
has<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.520> be<00:05:54.639> different<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.180> we<00:05:55.300> actually

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
has to be different and we actually

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.809 
has to be different and we actually
still<00:05:56.020> sit<00:05:56.710> on<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:56.919> backsides<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.610> those

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
still sit on the backsides of those

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.969 
still sit on the backsides of those
boxes<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.810> make<00:05:58.960> sure<00:05:59.139> that<00:05:59.319> seed<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.680> going

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
boxes to make sure that seed is going

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.140 
boxes to make sure that seed is going
down<00:06:00.219> very<00:06:00.639> very<00:06:00.939> correctly<00:06:02.819> the<00:06:03.819> pumpkin

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
down very very correctly the pumpkin

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.110 
down very very correctly the pumpkin
industry<00:06:04.810> is<00:06:05.159> we<00:06:06.159> grow<00:06:06.370> more<00:06:06.580> pumpkins<00:06:06.969> in

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
industry is we grow more pumpkins in

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.480 
industry is we grow more pumpkins in
Illinois<00:06:07.389> than<00:06:07.719> any<00:06:07.840> other<00:06:08.050> place<00:06:08.349> but<00:06:08.490> to

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
Illinois than any other place but to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.839 
Illinois than any other place but to
develop<00:06:09.939> that<00:06:10.150> kind<00:06:10.659> of<00:06:10.979> planter<00:06:11.979> is<00:06:12.279> it's

develop that kind of planter is it's

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.029 
develop that kind of planter is it's
going<00:06:13.090> to<00:06:13.150> be<00:06:13.240> a<00:06:13.270> little<00:06:13.449> difficult<00:06:13.689> but<00:06:14.169> we

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
going to be a little difficult but we

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.769 
going to be a little difficult but we
make<00:06:15.490> our<00:06:15.669> life<00:06:15.819> a<00:06:16.000> lot<00:06:16.120> better<00:06:16.180> if<00:06:16.599> we<00:06:16.750> could

make our life a lot better if we could

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.350 
make our life a lot better if we could
get<00:06:17.139> that<00:06:17.199> perfect<00:06:17.650> pumpkin<00:06:18.039> planter<00:06:18.759> well

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:21.219 
and yet with technology one of the

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:22.469 
and yet with technology one of the
things<00:06:21.430> we<00:06:21.550> noticed<00:06:21.849> on<00:06:21.969> the<00:06:22.089> field<00:06:22.300> where

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
things we noticed on the field where

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.809 
things we noticed on the field where
your<00:06:22.659> bees<00:06:23.069> tell<00:06:24.069> us<00:06:24.159> about<00:06:24.250> your<00:06:24.430> beads<00:06:24.639> how

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
your bees tell us about your beads how

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.969 
your bees tell us about your beads how
important<00:06:25.210> while<00:06:25.419> they<00:06:25.599> play<00:06:25.839> we<00:06:26.440> need<00:06:26.710> the

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
important while they play we need the

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.279 
important while they play we need the
bees<00:06:27.190> if<00:06:27.520> we<00:06:27.669> don't<00:06:27.879> have<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.330> bees<00:06:28.629> we<00:06:29.080> don't

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
bees if we don't have the bees we don't
