done everything of interest on this
screen<00:07:00.969> so<00:07:01.969> I<00:07:03.159> think<00:07:04.159> it<00:07:04.279> actually<00:07:04.519> took<00:07:04.609> me

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729 
screen so I think it actually took me

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.279 
screen so I think it actually took me
about<00:07:04.879> 10<00:07:05.119> minutes<00:07:05.419> so<00:07:05.809> I'm<00:07:05.929> going<00:07:06.049> to<00:07:06.139> walk<00:07:06.259> a

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
little closer to the exit and then that

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.589 
little closer to the exit and then that
is<00:07:09.229> where<00:07:09.379> we<00:07:09.469> will<00:07:09.529> stop<00:07:09.769> this<00:07:09.919> video<00:07:10.599> next

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 
and totally not another forest screen

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.859

can figure out how you get out of here

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:28.149 
can figure out how you get out of here
which<00:07:24.019> I<00:07:24.409> may<00:07:25.159> not<00:07:25.309> be<00:07:25.429> able<00:07:25.610> to<00:07:25.729> do<00:07:27.159> because

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:28.159

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150 
time I will have figured out where I'm

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.409 
time I will have figured out where I'm
supposed<00:07:49.479> to<00:07:49.509> go<00:07:49.569> later
