00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.780
 and I am a volunteer I will be your teacher 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 today we will be talking about the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.939
 filing the whole numbers that is 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 in the book group Indian river in the week 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.189
 eighth in the first tribute well that is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.349
 the eradication in the whole numbers 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.930
 eradication would be like the process 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 inverse to empowerment we are going to 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.700
 define what are the parts of the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.890
 filing here we have the example 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.489
 here as you can see it 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.180
 and this would be going to divide it into parts 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.829
 to explain what is here would be the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.649
 index 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.649
 x would be radical denial 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.450
 this part here that looks like a v 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.640
 with a line here we have it is the sign 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.680
 radical and the b is the root well and now 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.170
 we are going to explain how a 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.360
 filing as an example here we have 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.690
 the square root of 16 and the result 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.610
 would be 4 that would be its root and because 4 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:26.890
 because 4 squared 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.950
 would be 16 the root is the number that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.440
 high index gives the amount left over 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.370
 ical 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.590
 that's why we say that 4 squares 16 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.020
 now let's explain how it reads in 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.730
 the roots when we have 12 as an index 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.040
 we say that it is a square root but 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.480
 also if there is no index 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:56.320
 blank is also square root 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.020
 when we have a 36 the cubic root like 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.330
 was here raised to the bucket would be 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.750
 exactly 8 is said to be a root 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.789
 exact and the same goes for the 4 and the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.679
 16 because 4 squared would be 16 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.719
 now let's go with the properties of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 the filing in the first property 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:17.670
 we have that when we have a 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.870
 multiplication within the root we have 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.209
 to separate them and put them in the same 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.770
 root for the same index for example 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.350
 here we would have root ndx because 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.740
 and the separ we would do would be ndx network by 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.890
 king n from here in the example we have root 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.770
 cubic of 2 by 8 to simplify it and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.960
 make it easier we separate the 2 and the 8 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.819
 and we put the same root with the same 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.030
 index here we would have root 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.230
 located 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.510
 x 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:59.069
 and we do the filing that would be what 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.069
 would be the root of 8 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.630
 we would have 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.360
 two kubica kings 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.760
 fingers 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.970
 in the second property what we have 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.030
 at the root of one of a quotient or a 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.960
 division and we would do the same as the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.260
 multiplication separate them we would have the 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.810
 root in the x on y and separate and masters 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.060
 king of queen and about king in him and for 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.340
 simplify it down I have an example 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.459
 would be the square root of four about 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.740
 three or four thirds and then we would have 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.930
 what to do would be to separate it and put the 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.410
 same the same root with the same same 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.410
 index 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.670
 we solve the square root of 4 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.670
 it would be 2 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.970
 about square roots of 3 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.310
 at gago but on third property of the 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.170
 property the property says that when 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.230
 they have a root already elevated to a 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.480
 power is logical that puts in the number 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.170
 plead to that power as we can see 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.360
 here in this example we have this king 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.360
 raised to the my would be the same as 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.070
 put never has his preaching elevated to 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.160
 that number 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.760
 and here we have the reminder of 3 elevated 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.480
 of 4 and it's the same as putting the 3 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.590
 high 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:43.630
 and we solve it by dividing 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.630
 the power between the index 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.700
 do not 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.260
 as an exponent 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.790
 the answer would be 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.590
 in the fourth property of the 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.600
 eradication we have one root of another 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.190
 root here would be king n of root m of x lo 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.780
 what we have to do is multiply the 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.780
 indexes and we would have 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.569
 the result in this example we have 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.240
 square root cube root of 4 le 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:17.110
 we explained the indices we would have king 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.660
 sixth of 4 to solve it we could 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.050
 do 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.320
 sixth king of 2 squared because of the 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.630
 two to squares 4 then as 6 and 2 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.630
 they are multiples we divide here 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.860
 and I would give 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.020
 what we would have as a cubic root 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.900
 of 2 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.699
 well now let's practice in your 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.480
 air book exercises the first 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.880
 part 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.880
 and from the second part I'm going to do it 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:01.269
 well let's solve the extremes 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.189
 rector to 64 here what we have to 

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:05.889
 to do is look for the numbers that 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:10.560
 multiplied by themselves twice 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:13.479
 of 64 if we already know that 6 times 6 36 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:18.819
 so let's look for numbers greater than 6 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:22.090
 to solve the 77 would be 49 so 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:26.020
 another 8 times 8 is 64 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.210
 then the square root 64 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.669
 it would be 8 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.870
 now let's solve those of the second 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.960
 part 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.590
 here would be the square root of 5 x 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.530
 boxes of 3 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:46.110
 we can as a multiplication of the 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:48.740
 We can separate the root now from 5 x 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.740
 square root 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.590
 3 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.600
 and here we see that there is another property that 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.600
 it would be the root of the root 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.110
 would be 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.590
 the square of 5 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.440
 poor 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:11.470
 index would be 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.470
 4 fourth of 3 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.660
 and that's how Diana showed you the 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.660
 eradication
