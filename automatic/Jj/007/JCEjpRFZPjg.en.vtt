teach<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.090> a<00:00:15.770> little<00:00:16.770> trick<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.220> Forge<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
teach you a little trick on Forge and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.480 
teach you a little trick on Forge and
that<00:00:18.480> trick<00:00:18.780> is<00:00:19.020> how<00:00:19.110> to<00:00:19.410> build<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.010> armored

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that trick is how to build a armored

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.660 
that trick is how to build a armored
Mongoose<00:00:20.940> machine<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> while<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.520> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
Mongoose machine so while this is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.520 
Mongoose machine so while this is
getting<00:00:23.880> set<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.120> I'm<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.840> gonna<00:00:24.960> show<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.440> a

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
getting set up I'm just gonna show you a

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.779 
getting set up I'm just gonna show you a
clip<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.880> Machine<00:00:27.690> looks<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.789> okay

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
clip of what the Machine looks like okay

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.150 
clip of what the Machine looks like okay
guys<00:00:30.030> so<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.350> right<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
guys so as you can see right there it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.910 
guys so as you can see right there it
looks<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> box<00:00:34.620> type

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
looks kind of like a like a box type

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.640 
looks kind of like a like a box type
thing<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.150> like<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> machine<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
thing and it's just like a machine that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.790 
thing and it's just like a machine that
the<00:00:38.070> Mongoose<00:00:38.880> enters<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.720> at<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> other<00:00:40.500> end

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the Mongoose enters and at the other end

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.700 
the Mongoose enters and at the other end
it's<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.970> armored<00:00:42.360> Mongoose<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.470> it's<00:00:43.620> pretty

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
it's an armored Mongoose so it's pretty

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.280 
it's an armored Mongoose so it's pretty
useful<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.059> an<00:00:45.390> extra<00:00:45.809> effect<00:00:46.140> on

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
useful for like just an extra effect on

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.560 
useful for like just an extra effect on
a<00:00:46.320> map<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:47.130> just<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> impress<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.390> friends

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a map or just to impress your friends

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.900 
a map or just to impress your friends
like<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.380> they're<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.950> watching<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
like if they're just watching you and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.190 
like if they're just watching you and
they're<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.360> waiting<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:52.050> what's

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
they're just like waiting for what's

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.010 
they're just like waiting for what's
going<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.410> happen<00:00:53.059> they<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
going to happen they see you go in and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
going to happen they see you go in and
then<00:00:55.170> come<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.469> differently<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
then come out differently so it just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.780 
then come out differently so it just
hits<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.540> bomb<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.890> land<00:00:59.550> mine

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
hits the little bomb or the land mine

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.880 
hits the little bomb or the land mine
and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.780> creates<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.290> armored<00:01:01.649> shield

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and then it creates an armored shield

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.460 
and then it creates an armored shield
over<00:01:02.700> your<00:01:02.820> vehicle

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.890 

in<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:09.640> video<00:01:09.850> I'm<00:01:10.270> gonna<00:01:10.420> go<00:01:10.630> ahead<00:01:10.750> and

they<00:01:14.650> have<00:01:14.980> created<00:01:15.610> unique<00:01:16.260> forged<00:01:17.260> tips<00:01:17.560> and

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
they have created unique forged tips and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.650 
they have created unique forged tips and
tricks<00:01:17.980> and<00:01:18.220> this<00:01:18.370> is<00:01:18.520> one<00:01:18.730> of<00:01:18.760> them<00:01:18.970> just<00:01:19.180> I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
tricks and this is one of them just I

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.480 
tricks and this is one of them just I
want<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.900> remake<00:01:20.260> it<00:01:20.320> due<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.130> fact<00:01:21.280> that

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
want to remake it due to the fact that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.210 
want to remake it due to the fact that
his<00:01:21.790> video<00:01:22.540> was<00:01:22.870> like<00:01:23.020> 13<00:01:23.410> minutes<00:01:23.680> along<00:01:23.950> and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
his video was like 13 minutes along and

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.430 
his video was like 13 minutes along and
not<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> lot<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.880> people<00:01:25.030> understood<00:01:25.510> it<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.350> I'm

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
not a lot of people understood it so I'm

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.660 
not a lot of people understood it so I'm
just<00:01:26.590> going<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.800> create<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.310> short<00:01:27.550> little

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
just going to create this short little

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.480 
just going to create this short little
one<00:01:27.970> hopefully<00:01:28.660> you<00:01:28.750> guys<00:01:28.840> understand<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.500> so

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
one hopefully you guys understand it so

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.770 
one hopefully you guys understand it so
as<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.760> can<00:01:30.880> see<00:01:31.060> right<00:01:31.090> now<00:01:31.330> I'm<00:01:31.720> just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
as you can see right now I'm just

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.980 
as you can see right now I'm just
creating<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.650> bridge<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.450> bridge<00:01:34.480> is

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
creating a bridge and the bridge is

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.840 
creating a bridge and the bridge is
where<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.350> Mongoose<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.190> enter<00:01:36.550> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
where the Mongoose is going to enter the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.830 
where the Mongoose is going to enter the
box<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.530> when<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.190> trigger<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.180> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
box and that's when the trigger of the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.810 
box and that's when the trigger of the
barricade<00:01:41.350> Falls<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.950> goes<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.460> Mongoose

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
barricade Falls and goes on the Mongoose

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.200 
barricade Falls and goes on the Mongoose
for<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.300> armor<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:45.310> now<00:01:45.460> I'm<00:01:45.760> just<00:01:45.820> gonna

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
for the armor right now I'm just gonna

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.010 
for the armor right now I'm just gonna
build<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:47.020> triggers<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.950> are<00:01:48.760> going<00:01:48.880> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
build the triggers that are going to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.140 
build the triggers that are going to
launch<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.380> bear<00:01:50.680> cage<00:01:50.920> fall<00:01:51.280> down<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.790> go

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
launch the bear cage fall down and go

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.630 
launch the bear cage fall down and go
over<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.510> Mongoose<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.920> trigger<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.430> we're

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
over the Mongoose the trigger that we're

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.240 
over the Mongoose the trigger that we're
going<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.820> use<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.960> lamb<00:01:56.290> I'm<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:57.070> land

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
going to use is the lamb I'm the land

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.640 
going to use is the lamb I'm the land
mines<00:01:57.460> going<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.790> work<00:01:57.940> as<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.150> button<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.780> it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
mines going to work as a button and it's

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.640 
mines going to work as a button and it's
going<00:01:59.830> to<00:01:59.890> hit<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.780> fusion<00:02:01.780> coils<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.320> go<00:02:02.470> up

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
going to hit the fusion coils to go up

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.670 
going to hit the fusion coils to go up
and<00:02:02.860> drop<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.700> barricade<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.290> protect

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
and drop the barricade now to protect

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.010 
and drop the barricade now to protect
your<00:02:06.190> land<00:02:06.610> mine<00:02:06.910> from<00:02:07.180> exploding<00:02:07.630> your

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
your land mine from exploding your

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.749 
your land mine from exploding your
Mongoose<00:02:08.590> you're<00:02:09.009> going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> need<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.610> lay

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
Mongoose you're going to need to lay

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.870 
Mongoose you're going to need to lay
down<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:10.270> shield<00:02:10.840> door<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.280> shield<00:02:12.670> door

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
down a shield door now the shield door

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.050 
down a shield door now the shield door
is<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> protect<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:15.030> explosion<00:02:16.030> from

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
is going to protect the explosion from

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.320 
is going to protect the explosion from
killing<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.220> still<00:02:18.550> triggers<00:02:18.940> from

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
killing you but it still triggers from

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.500 
killing you but it still triggers from
beneath<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:20.500> give<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.220> effect<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
beneath to give it the effect of the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.320 
beneath to give it the effect of the
trigger<00:02:23.070> now<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.519> lay<00:02:24.730> down<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.970> structure<00:02:25.630> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
trigger now you lay down a structure to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.390 
trigger now you lay down a structure to
have<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.660> button<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.320> red<00:02:29.500> dot<00:02:29.769> just<00:02:30.280> a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
have the button the red dot just a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.420 
have the button the red dot just a
little<00:02:30.760> bit<00:02:31.030> over<00:02:31.450> or<00:02:31.870> up<00:02:32.470> above<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.190> surface

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
little bit over or up above the surface

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.000 
little bit over or up above the surface
so<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.390> acts<00:02:34.900> as<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.380> button<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:37.739> once<00:02:38.739> you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
so it acts as the button now once you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.210 
so it acts as the button now once you
have<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:40.090> lay<00:02:40.299> down<00:02:40.540> then<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.320> angle<00:02:41.950> your

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
have it lay down then you angle your

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.110 
have it lay down then you angle your
fusion<00:02:42.610> coils<00:02:43.120> going<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:44.730> before<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:45.820> do<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
fusion coils going up before we do the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600 
fusion coils going up before we do the
rest<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.510> fusion<00:02:46.870> coils<00:02:47.260> first<00:02:47.980> off<00:02:48.190> we're

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
rest of the fusion coils first off we're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.660 
rest of the fusion coils first off we're
gonna<00:02:48.670> test<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.739> button<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:51.160> see<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.459> works

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
gonna test the button to see if it works

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.699 
gonna test the button to see if it works
so<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.600> go<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.810> your<00:02:52.900> Mongoose<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.410> go<00:02:53.590> over

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
so if you go on your Mongoose to go over

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.070 
so if you go on your Mongoose to go over
the<00:02:53.830> button<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.269> see<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.810> your

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
the button you can see that your

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.789 
the button you can see that your
Mongoose<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:57.180> detonating<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.390> bottom<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.769> you

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
Mongoose is detonating the bottom so you

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.400 
Mongoose is detonating the bottom so you
can<00:03:00.280> kind<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.610> adjust<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.299> shield<00:03:01.600> or<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.260> make

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
can kind of adjust the shield or to make

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.289 
can kind of adjust the shield or to make
it<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.620> little<00:03:02.799> bit<00:03:03.010> down<00:03:03.549> more<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
it a little bit down more and the

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.870 
it a little bit down more and the
landmine<00:03:04.660> down<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> little<00:03:05.739> bit<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.820> still

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
landmine down a little bit but still

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.900 
landmine down a little bit but still
have<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.570> button<00:03:07.900> sticking<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.549> reason

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
have the button sticking out the reason

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.670 
have the button sticking out the reason
it's<00:03:10.060> doing<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:10.900> vehicles

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
it's doing that is because vehicles

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.120 
it's doing that is because vehicles
won't<00:03:12.459> get<00:03:12.670> um<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:13.690> just<00:03:14.290> don't<00:03:14.530> go<00:03:14.680> over<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
won't get um they just don't go over the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.220 
won't get um they just don't go over the
shield<00:03:15.370> doors<00:03:15.489> because<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.750> causes<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
shield doors because it causes the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.730 
shield doors because it causes the
effect<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.770> bounce<00:03:18.010> um<00:03:19.020> what<00:03:20.020> I<00:03:20.050> recommend

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
effect of a bounce um what I recommend

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.200 
effect of a bounce um what I recommend
is

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
is

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.810 
is
you<00:03:22.270> put<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.780> button<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.380> side<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.010> have

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
you put the button on the side and have

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.660 
you put the button on the side and have
it<00:03:24.940> skim<00:03:25.270> up<00:03:25.420> against<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.960> as<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.920> can<00:03:27.010> see<00:03:27.220> my

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
it skim up against it as you can see my

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.950 
it skim up against it as you can see my
player<00:03:27.910> walked<00:03:28.870> over<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.560> dime<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:31.510> I'm

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
player walked over it and dime but I'm

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.960 
player walked over it and dime but I'm
gonna<00:03:32.350> fix<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.740> by<00:03:33.220> putting<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:33.640> button<00:03:33.850> on

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
gonna fix that by putting the button on

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.600 
gonna fix that by putting the button on
the<00:03:34.060> side<00:03:34.440> now<00:03:35.440> by<00:03:35.560> putting<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.130> button<00:03:36.490> on

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
the side now by putting the button on

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.810 
the side now by putting the button on
the<00:03:36.730> side<00:03:37.000> wall<00:03:37.740> allows<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:39.160> vehicle<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.610> go

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
the side wall allows the vehicle to go

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.330 
the side wall allows the vehicle to go
straight<00:03:40.090> forward<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.840> skim<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.800> button<00:03:42.100> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
straight forward and skim the button and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.750 
straight forward and skim the button and
detonate<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.710> fusion<00:03:44.710> coils<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.400> detonate

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
detonate the fusion coils to detonate

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.510 
detonate the fusion coils to detonate
the<00:03:45.970> barricade<00:03:46.360> default<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:48.040> I'm<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.340> going

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
the barricade default so I'm just going

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.690 
the barricade default so I'm just going
to<00:03:48.580> go<00:03:48.760> ahead<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.180> test<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.540> out<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:51.040> work

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
to go ahead and test that out so work

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.360 
to go ahead and test that out so work
perfectly<00:03:52.180> skimmed<00:03:52.870> across<00:03:53.010> now<00:03:54.010> we<00:03:54.070> check

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
perfectly skimmed across now we check

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.640 
perfectly skimmed across now we check
the<00:03:54.520> set<00:03:54.730> up<00:03:54.850> our<00:03:55.120> angles<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:56.140> our<00:03:56.410> fusion

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the set up our angles of our fusion

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.450 
the set up our angles of our fusion
coils<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.310> trigger<00:03:57.550> our<00:03:57.790> barricade<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.310> right

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
coils to trigger our barricade so right

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.910 
coils to trigger our barricade so right
there<00:04:00.760> my<00:04:01.240> fusion<00:04:01.780> coils<00:04:02.050> are<00:04:02.170> going<00:04:02.320> up<00:04:02.560> right

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
there my fusion coils are going up right

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.990 
there my fusion coils are going up right
over<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.790> tip<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.210> wall<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:05.500> get<00:04:06.000> right

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
over the tip of the wall to get right

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.040 
over the tip of the wall to get right
under<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:08.320> barricades<00:04:09.280> fusion<00:04:09.670> coil<00:04:10.050> so

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
under the barricades fusion coil so

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.240 
under the barricades fusion coil so
we're<00:04:11.620> gonna<00:04:11.740> place<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:13.290> fixed<00:04:14.290> fusion<00:04:15.010> coil

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
we're gonna place a fixed fusion coil

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.450 
we're gonna place a fixed fusion coil
right<00:04:16.150> onto<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> barricade<00:04:17.170> so<00:04:17.950> it's<00:04:18.160> holding

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
right onto the barricade so it's holding

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.140 
right onto the barricade so it's holding
it<00:04:18.580> up<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.930> when<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:21.070> land<00:04:21.670> mine<00:04:21.850> gets

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
it up but when the land mine gets

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.540 
it up but when the land mine gets
touched<00:04:22.420> it'll<00:04:23.200> detonate<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.860> fusion<00:04:24.250> coils

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
touched it'll detonate the fusion coils

kind of like a domino effect in a sort

the way up hit the fixed fusion coil

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.130 
the way up hit the fixed fusion coil
that<00:04:33.760> is<00:04:34.000> holding<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.420> barricade<00:04:34.780> up<00:04:34.930> and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
that is holding the barricade up and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:44.629 
that is holding the barricade up and
make<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:35.830> fall<00:04:36.130> directly<00:04:36.610> onto<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.120> mongoose

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:51.200 

you

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.390 

once<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.420> have<00:04:52.690> your<00:04:52.930> barricade<00:04:53.560> set<00:04:53.890> up<00:04:54.040> so

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
once you have your barricade set up so

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.860 
once you have your barricade set up so
it's<00:04:54.550> kind<00:04:54.730> of<00:04:54.760> level<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.510> will<00:04:55.660> fall

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
it's kind of level and it will fall

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.480 
it's kind of level and it will fall
directly<00:04:56.290> onto<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.650> mongoose<00:04:57.040> when<00:04:57.400> the

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
directly onto the mongoose when the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.490 
directly onto the mongoose when the
bombs<00:04:57.730> detonated<00:04:58.300> then<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.200> go<00:04:59.380> ahead

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
bombs detonated then you can go ahead

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.580 
bombs detonated then you can go ahead
and<00:04:59.650> test<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.190> out<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:01.450> just<00:05:02.080> kind<00:05:02.290> of<00:05:02.320> get<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.560> a

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
and test it out so just kind of get on a

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:16.660 
and test it out so just kind of get on a
mongoose<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.400> see<00:05:03.640> how<00:05:03.730> it<00:05:03.850> works

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.200 

yeah<00:05:17.120> once<00:05:17.960> i<00:05:18.260> hit<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.590> bomb<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:19.820> realize

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
yeah once i hit the bomb you realize

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.500 
yeah once i hit the bomb you realize
that<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.510> barricade<00:05:20.930> flew<00:05:21.410> out<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:23.090> prevent

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
that the barricade flew out to prevent

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.980 
that the barricade flew out to prevent
the<00:05:23.630> barricade<00:05:24.410> to<00:05:25.040> from<00:05:25.340> just<00:05:26.270> going

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
the barricade to from just going

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.830 
the barricade to from just going
wherever<00:05:27.200> once<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:28.640> can<00:05:28.820> go<00:05:28.850> ahead<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.390> get<00:05:29.810> a

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
wherever once you can go ahead and get a

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.000 
wherever once you can go ahead and get a
shield<00:05:30.320> door<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:31.060> some<00:05:32.060> walls<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:33.620> walls<00:05:33.800> in

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
shield door and some walls the walls in

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.830 
shield door and some walls the walls in
the<00:05:34.130> shield<00:05:34.370> or<00:05:34.610> will<00:05:34.940> make<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:35.570> bounce

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
the shield or will make it bounce

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.730 
the shield or will make it bounce
straight<00:05:36.350> down<00:05:37.090> level<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.420> mongoose<00:05:38.870> so

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
straight down level to the mongoose so

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.230 
straight down level to the mongoose so
i'm<00:05:39.830> going<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.160> go<00:05:40.280> ahead<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.550> get<00:05:40.820> my<00:05:40.970> shield

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
i'm going to go ahead and get my shield

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:49.610 
i'm going to go ahead and get my shield
doors<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.690> walls

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:59.870 

you

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.630 

so<00:06:00.720> once<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:01.050> get<00:06:01.260> your<00:06:01.560> shield<00:06:02.070> doors<00:06:02.250> and

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
so once you get your shield doors and

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.580 
so once you get your shield doors and
your<00:06:02.730> walls<00:06:03.000> all<00:06:03.300> set<00:06:03.690> ups<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.140> barricades

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
your walls all set ups the barricades

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.740 
your walls all set ups the barricades
kind<00:06:04.860> of<00:06:04.950> tightly<00:06:05.310> compacted<00:06:05.940> and<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.510> will<00:06:06.600> go

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
kind of tightly compacted and it will go

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.600 
kind of tightly compacted and it will go
straight<00:06:06.990> down<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.920> mongoose<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.520> way

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
straight down on the mongoose the way

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.250 
straight down on the mongoose the way
you<00:06:08.670> lined<00:06:08.910> it<00:06:09.060> up<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.810> can<00:06:09.960> go<00:06:10.050> ahead<00:06:10.140> and

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
you lined it up you can go ahead and

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.460 
you lined it up you can go ahead and
test<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.710> out<00:06:14.510> so<00:06:15.510> as<00:06:15.630> you<00:06:15.780> can<00:06:15.870> see<00:06:16.110> my

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
test it out so as you can see my

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.710 
test it out so as you can see my
barricade<00:06:17.310> didn't<00:06:17.640> fall<00:06:17.850> the<00:06:18.000> way<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.150> wanted

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
barricade didn't fall the way I wanted

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.980 
barricade didn't fall the way I wanted
to<00:06:18.780> right<00:06:19.410> over<00:06:19.590> it<00:06:20.390> so<00:06:21.390> what<00:06:21.540> you<00:06:21.630> can<00:06:21.720> do<00:06:21.840> to

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
to right over it so what you can do to

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.380 
to right over it so what you can do to
fix<00:06:22.140> that<00:06:22.440> is<00:06:22.710> tilted<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.700> different<00:06:24.030> certain

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
fix that is tilted a different certain

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.830 
fix that is tilted a different certain
way<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:25.160> just<00:06:26.160> make<00:06:26.580> sure<00:06:26.790> it<00:06:27.030> falls<00:06:27.480> the<00:06:27.750> way

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
way and just make sure it falls the way

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.959 
way and just make sure it falls the way
you<00:06:27.900> want<00:06:28.200> it<00:06:28.290> to

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
you want it to

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.070 
you want it to
once<00:06:30.969> you<00:06:31.120> have<00:06:31.240> your<00:06:31.419> bear<00:06:31.629> how<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:31.870> set<00:06:32.050> up

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
once you have your bear how you set up

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.809 
once you have your bear how you set up
then<00:06:32.530> you're<00:06:32.650> going<00:06:32.770> to<00:06:32.830> add<00:06:32.889> decorations

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
then you're going to add decorations

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.529 
then you're going to add decorations
around<00:06:34.180> it<00:06:34.539> to<00:06:34.719> make<00:06:34.749> it<00:06:34.900> look<00:06:35.020> more<00:06:35.199> of<00:06:35.620> a

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
around it to make it look more of a

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.330 
around it to make it look more of a
actual<00:06:37.539> object<00:06:38.110> than<00:06:38.289> just<00:06:38.529> kind<00:06:38.740> of<00:06:38.860> thrown

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
actual object than just kind of thrown

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.899 
actual object than just kind of thrown
out<00:06:39.490> pieces<00:06:39.969> now<00:06:40.659> i'm<00:06:40.779> not<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.080> best<00:06:41.289> I<00:06:41.560> like

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
out pieces now i'm not the best I like

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.269 
out pieces now i'm not the best I like
aesthetics<00:06:42.909> or<00:06:43.330> decorating<00:06:44.050> so<00:06:44.770> I'm<00:06:45.129> just

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
aesthetics or decorating so I'm just

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.749 
aesthetics or decorating so I'm just
going<00:06:45.400> to<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.550> best<00:06:45.669> I<00:06:45.759> could<00:06:45.819> so<00:06:46.719> I<00:06:47.370> just<00:06:48.370> kind

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
going to the best I could so I just kind

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.089 
going to the best I could so I just kind
of<00:06:48.819> made<00:06:49.419> it<00:06:49.599> so<00:06:49.840> it<00:06:49.960> had<00:06:50.080> like<00:06:50.199> a<00:06:50.259> skin<00:06:50.860> around

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:51.099 
of made it so it had like a skin around

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.600 
of made it so it had like a skin around
it<00:06:51.340> with<00:06:52.150> a<00:06:52.389> little<00:06:52.900> light<00:06:53.110> and<00:06:53.379> an<00:06:54.069> armor<00:06:54.460> lock

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
it with a little light and an armor lock

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.399 
it with a little light and an armor lock
thing<00:06:54.909> so<00:06:55.389> it<00:06:55.449> kind<00:06:55.689> of<00:06:55.749> shows<00:06:55.960> that<00:06:56.139> it's<00:06:56.289> an

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
thing so it kind of shows that it's an

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.390 
thing so it kind of shows that it's an
armored<00:06:56.949> machine<00:06:59.009> now<00:07:00.009> once<00:07:00.159> you<00:07:00.310> have

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
armored machine now once you have

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.800 
armored machine now once you have
everything<00:07:00.520> set<00:07:00.939> up<00:07:00.969> then<00:07:01.389> you<00:07:01.569> can<00:07:01.659> go<00:07:01.779> ahead

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
everything set up then you can go ahead

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.589
