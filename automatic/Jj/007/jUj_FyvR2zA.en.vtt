 special today so kind of 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.470
 the video game universe but we remain 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.360
 in this mysterious atmosphere and I 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.670
 I'm sure this video will delight the most 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.080
 curious of you the prerequisites are 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.690
 extremely simple all you need is 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.140
 bring you free google software 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.309
 earth its software makes it a view of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.720
 satellite of the planet earth you 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.390
 can travel the land from home 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.100
 you through the water this software all at 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.510
 along this video I will list the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.340
 twenty places that for me are the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.469
 weirdest of our planet earth 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.969
 on each photo you will have the 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.680
 coordinates you just need to 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.210
 copy the coordinates and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.920
 enter in the search bar of 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.110
 google earth for you check by you 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.370
 same as these photos are not faked 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.250
 these are screenshots that I took 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.950
 directly from the software go on 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.570
 attack right away we attack and 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.009
 that a pretty original symbol look at a 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.649
 triangle with a round symbol to 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.940
 inside I do not know where this was 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.860
 could happen even if they have men in 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.810
 self realizes that this symbol this due to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.770
 middle of a plain surrounded by 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.740
 mountains you can go to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.540
 shoemaker to check here I put to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.369
 challenge your imagination that 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.409
 do you see on the picture me I see the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.100
 head of an old Indian and at the end of 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.720
 count itunes mountain range at the same 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.659
 place on the side of a hill you 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.920
 find a giant engraved on the rock 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.680
 in the same context but on another 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.570
 continent also finds you a head 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.710
 of indian embossed with the mountain I 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.630
 find it very original even more fun 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.280
 look in the middle of the park on 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.119
 do you want to see a fingerprint 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.119
 huge 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 so here these are really symbols 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.490
 special I do not know what that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.930
 represent 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.880
 rendezvous during a single and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.450
 you will see that there are a lot in 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.740
 the desert I do not know what it is 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.140
 symbol you may need to think about 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.910
 sci-fi movies or at the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.140
 realization of UFO in any case I 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.140
 find it very fun 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.390
 nice little text on the 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.390
 hillside 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.890
 certainly one of my pictures the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.990
 most preferred look at the shadow of the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.430
 hollow that looks completely normal and 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.020
 look now long of the triangle 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.690
 on the water that leaves is levitating 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.760
 I was not what object that could be here 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.500
 your imagination is going to be rough 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.030
 test look at the task in the middle of 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.550
 Desert it looks like a footprint 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.860
 giant easily recognizable here 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.900
 it's a pink rabbit made by 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.950
 buildings I find that it's very fun to 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.950
 seen in this light there 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.900
 the famous sign of ying and yang very 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.900
 well done in this chan 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.620
 a magnificent champion lyon 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.350
 so here what can it be I 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.820
 you already see this plan 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.860
 structured but what is it 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.500
 brothel with all these traits everywhere and 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.480
 listen to me just to zoom out and 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.220
 look at what we find a canvas 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.660
 giant of road these are roads my 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.930
 friends environment a spider's web 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.930
 giantess 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.640
 here is the most monolith block 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.049
 great in the world 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.780
 look at the size of the road next to me 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.430
 invites you to zoom in by visiting 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.560
 the coordinates will see it's gigantic 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.150
 he cites a still symbol of science 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.099
 fiction I do not know how it can 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.840
 to be realized in this chan and that's it I 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.840
 invite you to go to the coordinates 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.390
 in the same spirit on a hill a 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.390
 huge triangle realize 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.410
 even more gigantic still in 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.810
 the mountains look at me this 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.150
 mosaic that is just sublime 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.610
 go to the coordinates for 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.490
 go through all this and finish with one 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.410
 small little landscape kept deep in the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.240
 garden what kia it looks like a saucer 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.919
 flying after it's a piece of wood and 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.949
 to play and I invite you to watch 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.350
 the area that there is another structure no 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.759
 far from this place I hope this 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.139
