00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
know it's been a challenging decision

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.249

for<00:01:26.860> me<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.310> invitational<00:01:28.090> category<00:01:28.899> as<00:01:29.050> as

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
for me the invitational category as as

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.969 
for me the invitational category as as
you<00:01:29.830> know<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.580> limited<00:01:31.450> it's<00:01:32.080> really<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.440> limited

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
you know a limited it's really a limited

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.360 
you know a limited it's really a limited
lifespan<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.799> obviously<00:01:35.799> I<00:01:35.920> push<00:01:36.220> the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
lifespan and obviously I push the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.100 
lifespan and obviously I push the
envelope<00:01:36.520> for<00:01:37.030> quite<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> long<00:01:37.330> time<00:01:37.510> on<00:01:37.960> that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
envelope for quite a long time on that

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.530 
envelope for quite a long time on that
hence<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.620> Corvette<00:01:39.040> project<00:01:39.640> but<00:01:40.360> at<00:01:40.479> the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
hence the Corvette project but at the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.030 
hence the Corvette project but at the
end<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.900> day<00:01:41.080> I<00:01:41.110> think<00:01:41.320> everybody<00:01:41.860> has<00:01:42.010> to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
end of the day I think everybody has to

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.250 
end of the day I think everybody has to
realize<00:01:42.520> these<00:01:42.790> events<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> certain<00:01:43.930> extent

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
realize these events to a certain extent

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.890 
realize these events to a certain extent
I<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:45.369> about<00:01:45.700> people<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:46.630> probably

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
I all about people and it's probably

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.080 
I all about people and it's probably
really<00:01:47.140> only<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.680> guys<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.220> top<00:01:48.520> ten<00:01:48.850> who

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
really only the guys in the top ten who

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.500 
really only the guys in the top ten who
are<00:01:50.080> really<00:01:50.500> desperate<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:51.130> get<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.970> results

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
are really desperate to get the results

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.440 
are really desperate to get the results
so<00:01:52.750> we<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.440> stay<00:01:53.650> focused<00:01:53.680> on

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700 

sure

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
sure

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.920 
sure
it's<00:02:03.340> all<00:02:03.490> about<00:02:03.520> me<00:02:04.150> then<00:02:04.450> we<00:02:04.630> couldn't

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
it's all about me then we couldn't

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.200 
it's all about me then we couldn't
really<00:02:05.080> justify<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.830> cost<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.640> you've<00:02:06.909> seen

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
really justify the cost so you've seen

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.419 
really justify the cost so you've seen
all<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.930> way<00:02:07.990> our<00:02:08.080> guys<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.350> gals<00:02:08.950> out<00:02:09.190> and

all the way our guys and gals out and
about<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.179> think<00:02:10.420> that's<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> spirit<00:02:11.350> of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
about and I think that's the spirit of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.910
