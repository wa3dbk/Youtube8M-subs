00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
just pull it behind the top because it's

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.660

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
officer but you need to understand that

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.680 
officer but you need to understand that
if<00:01:17.680> once<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.490> induce<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:18.970> it's<00:01:19.149> in<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.479> fight

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690
