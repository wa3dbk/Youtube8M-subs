00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.260 
a lip right here and then a threaded and
that<00:01:30.390> goes<00:01:30.539> right<00:01:30.690> here<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> goes<00:01:32.880> into

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that goes right here and it goes into

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.609 
that goes right here and it goes into
the<00:01:33.929> slot<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.100> lifter<00:01:35.520> spring<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.899> then

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the slot on a lifter spring and then

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.029 
the slot on a lifter spring and then
there's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.830> washer<00:01:38.509> one<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:40.039> lock

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
there's a washer one of those lock

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.039 
there's a washer one of those lock
washers<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.630> net<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:44.479> think<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.659> five

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
washers and a net and I think it's five

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
washers and a net and I think it's five
millimeters<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.720> then<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.899> spring<00:01:50.810> slides

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
millimeters and then this spring slides

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
millimeters and then this spring slides
forward<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> hooks<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:56.429> that<00:01:56.580> smooth

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
forward and hooks on to that smooth

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.920 
forward and hooks on to that smooth
surface<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.759> see<00:02:00.090> how

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
surface there and then you can see how

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
surface there and then you can see how
it's<00:02:01.170> supposed<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:02.060> functioning<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it's supposed to be functioning and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's supposed to be functioning and
crank<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.079> how<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.259> works<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:05.090> you'll

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
crank it this is how it works and you'll

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
crank it this is how it works and you'll
see<00:02:06.299> how<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:08.579> lifter<00:02:09.119> slides<00:02:10.079> into<00:02:10.320> this<00:02:10.560> slot

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
see how the lifter slides into this slot

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
see how the lifter slides into this slot
and<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.720> continues<00:02:13.170> back<00:02:13.519> there's<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:15.299> can

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and it continues back there's you can

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.560 
and it continues back there's you can
see<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.130> these<00:02:17.130> feet<00:02:17.489> there's<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.030> coming<00:02:18.329> up

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
see it these feet there's one coming up

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.199 
see it these feet there's one coming up
from<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> body<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.250> bus<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.820> there's<00:02:21.030> one

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
from the body of the bus and there's one

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.729 
from the body of the bus and there's one
hanging<00:02:21.510> down<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:22.019> what<00:02:22.170> causes<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.709> to

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
hanging down that's what causes it to

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.449 
hanging down that's what causes it to
lift<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.400> rides<00:02:23.609> off<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.209> another

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
lift up it rides off on one another

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.800 
lift up it rides off on one another
watch<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.670> function<00:02:29.390> sorry<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.780> shaky

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
watch it function sorry it's so shaky

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780 
watch it function sorry it's so shaky
trying<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.739> hold<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.160> crank<00:02:32.400> at<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.609> same

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
trying to hold and crank at the same

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:42.420 
trying to hold and crank at the same
time

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.880

you'll see that the tables crisscross
there's<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.960> square<00:03:54.960> plate<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:57.420> goes<00:03:57.600> on<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
there's a square plate that goes on the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.890 
there's a square plate that goes on the
bottom<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:59.580> there's<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.830> gear<00:04:01.830> goes<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.550> top

and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.050> there's<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.260> spring<00:04:04.680> plate<00:04:05.780> inside

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
and then there's a spring plate inside

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.500 
and then there's a spring plate inside
with<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.020> hole<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.620> has<00:04:07.770> two<00:04:08.130> lips<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:09.300> lips

go<00:04:09.750> here<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.230> here<00:04:11.480> sorry<00:04:12.560> this<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.740> the<00:04:13.800> way

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
go here and here sorry this is the way

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.280 
go here and here sorry this is the way
in<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.160> way<00:04:14.400> took<00:04:14.760> me<00:04:14.880> forever<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.210> cast<00:04:15.600> and

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
in this way took me forever to cast and

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.900 
in this way took me forever to cast and
then<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.739> got<00:04:16.860> to<00:04:16.980> kind<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.190> take<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> rubber

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
then you got to kind of take a rubber

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.430 
then you got to kind of take a rubber
mallet<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.420> beat<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.720> down<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.260> holds

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
mallet and beat it down so it holds

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.670 
mallet and beat it down so it holds
tight<00:04:19.800> against<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.250> gear<00:04:20.550> in<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.790> spring

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
tight against that gear in the spring

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.430 
tight against that gear in the spring
and<00:04:22.680> that's<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.040> way<00:04:23.160> that<00:04:23.190> works<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:24.260> mean<00:04:25.260> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
and that's the way that works I mean the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.190 
and that's the way that works I mean the
cover<00:04:25.650> help<00:04:26.040> hold<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.430> down<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.840> then<00:04:28.020> there's

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
cover help hold it down and then there's

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.440 
cover help hold it down and then there's
some<00:04:28.410> other<00:04:28.500> covers<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.310> go<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.940> here<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.210> just

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
some other covers that go on here I just

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:39.090 
some other covers that go on here I just
haven't<00:04:30.690> put<00:04:30.840> them<00:04:30.960> on<00:04:31.140> yet

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.240 

so<00:04:41.070> that's<00:04:42.070> how<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.280> thing<00:04:42.580> works<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:45.130> you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
so that's how the thing works if you

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.850 
so that's how the thing works if you
