 tables of time 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.600
 while countries in the region face to face

 Incarnation of the evil that takes away the sleep they feed on the infant year

 the decomposed corpse that slaughtered its victims in the form of a ghost 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.960
 the romantic antihero becomes 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.590
 and it is in that tenebrous 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.650
 that nurtured human health figure that we loved we knew the most obvious

 Lito Vitale by man will go uncertain number 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.949
 its importance was understood very early with the first 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.459
 communities 1 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.559
 the icons and the phenomenon 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:37.529
 inzaghi min 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.529
 it was clear that his loss lead to death 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.629
 we can consider 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.489
 normal that with society crowd 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 family charged action and magical religious significance 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.369
 according to Mesopotamian mythology and housing if they bought records say 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.689
 family suckers better known as vampire 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.669
 cites the cable and dignity capable of activity likewise ana 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.089
 and seduce their 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:22.609
 percent perversion cooperativism let's say it always existed among the 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.479
 villages 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.090
 the argaric theme 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.589
 that relationship with him 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:32.430
 this the most neat with death with death that returns in form 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.439
 you must move rebels 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.349
 that is to say because you do not owe life you do not resign yourself to death 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.279
 it is typical 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.540
 p of those people that of pessimism 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.720
 they got 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.290
 to be accusatory of their own history 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.789
 and in turn 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.789
 p the reincarnation of being 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.970
 it was in the 14th century 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.070
 during the investigations they found central regions of Europe when vampirism 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.070
 it took more strength 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.109
 here is an agenda conditions condition of long return 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.599
 even 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.979
 as interpreted 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.429
 he is thoughtful 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.489
 it was caused by vampires 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.889
 and the panic of the infection led people to bury dead bodies without 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
 even verify if they were truly 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.009
 it was then that it began to be thought that vampires were rising from their 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.210
 sepulchers 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.570
 the living zone that when leaving its grave was intercepted by vampires that 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.569
 inflicted of life in this way they turn one more 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:47.129
 in 1655 britain was affected by an appalling plague epidemic that 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.129
 caused the death of more than 150 thousand people 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.619
 one of the most frequent symptoms of this disease deep sleep 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.969
 that affects the patients making them fall into a kind of dream 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.650
 catalytic 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.419
 normally it is arranged to remove the corpses during the night 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.419
 this made confusion very likely 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.229
 with whom it seemed like a dream 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.969
 many sick 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.629
 they were exchanged for dead and buried alive, favoring the 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.699
 belief that the dead puig company related 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.550
 vampirism is one more way 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.779
 to be able to explain the relationship 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.770
 in the version between here says death 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.389
 that man is of 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.740
 sheath that is deeply rock 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.180
 but the true mania for Juan Pinto
