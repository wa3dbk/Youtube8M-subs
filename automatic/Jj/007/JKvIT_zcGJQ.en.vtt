00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.259
 Hi, how are you waiting for me? 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.500
 going well I know I'm a bad person 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.179
 because I have not uploaded video in two weeks 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.070
 so if you are watching this video a 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.410
 little so if you are watching this video 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 a little after apologies try to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 edit it as fast as I could but there 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 times when the edition is not so 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.240
 simple as it seems but good in this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 I'm going to show you the chords of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
 the song that's called weirdo the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.580
 which two people asked him and good to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.109
 those two people 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.030
 good here is the video I hope that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.070
 you can learn it and if you have any 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 doubt do not hesitate to leave it in the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.399
 comments like all the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.559
 people who are watching this have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.210
 Any question, can you ask me? 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 write in the comments though 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.829
 can send by personal message 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.450
 I'm going to leave my facebook here below and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 I will try to make this video as 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.789
 possible explanatory so that there 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.410
 no doubt and with the notes that we are going to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.820
 occupy smiles 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.150
 the least no sun 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.550
 in my minor 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.040
 those are all there is a small variation 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.810
 that takes the seventh in case you do not know 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.550
 good hours of ours and if it's the know 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.550
 good comitÃ¡n this step 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.520
 and good the strum is a bit difficult 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.229
 as I already commented but with practice 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.329
 it's going to be perfectly fine 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.979
 only in the stanzas or well I like that 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.200
 I put it in but if you want to follow 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 playing like this during the chorus is acceptable 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.460
 and without any problem 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 i 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.910
 what 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.910
 or 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 Y 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.230
 i 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.560
 Y 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.540
 Y 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.100
 and well said and all this I'm going to put 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.690
 the song is still saved in my video 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.730
 previous I made a pretty play 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.100
 disastrous I will try to do better this 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.020
 time and although you're listening to this I did 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.450
 my greatest effort not to destroy this 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.030
 song I did the best I could singing 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.350
 although I am not a singer in fact but 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.290
 good 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.840
 they go to pay close attention to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.290
 the chords and 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.890
 you 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.890
 two 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.500
 do not 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:50.430
 and the opposite 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.000
 if you go better I care 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.230
 with that light that alum skill with 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.819
 this dynamic with that feeling of my 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.459
 heart 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.609
 together everything was sanctioned when 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.639
 many lives and wake up in that day 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:12.439
 I tell you that they never change 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.439
 let's breathe and that entity ends 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.500
 cried 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:23.810
 and if you are no longer with what I am but 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.770
 the others maybe maybe issues will be 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.770
 deleted 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:36.420
 qualified is maybe not the way to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.420
 act maybe you move like you 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.020
 all right 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.020
 i 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.430
 just listen to it if we do not do something that 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.450
 it's called you have no record of what 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.690
 Do not let your eyes dodge another 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.170
 flames on the lost ship that seeks its 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 breeding 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.840
 drunk who is not right no one what 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.230
 is embracing the photograph now 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.080
 it is and it did not fall well I am well deep 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.550
 that changes your life lovers who cross 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.320
 in my curves 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:25.620
 the different artists looks 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:30.030
 a coral if you 're not mixing here I'm 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.720
 different from the others perhaps maybe 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.720
 the rest 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.160
 there are faithful to admonish that this form 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:47.080
 to act and maybe you 're not like 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.870
 is more if I hide and yesterday without 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.630
 sleep 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:05:00.260
 if I'm cold and love now I show you 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:04.910
 If you're like that, it's over 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.910
 it's normal 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.199
 if you're not hiding here 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:21.480
 in addition maybe it's fine maybe theme will be 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.540
 very special in the end is that it has to be 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.330
 maybe the way to act 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.330
 maybe you're not like the 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.770
 and good guys it would be the whole song 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.499
 young the same chords are repeated 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.080
 they can be done in a capo or in a normal note 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.939
 it depends on you that and good before 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.219
 to go east I wanted to ask you 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.110
 something and I'm doing a song 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.360
 the song of the one who showed it 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.869
 Alvaro but I honestly am not 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.069
 no rapper if something you rapper 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:57.649
 write in the comments please or 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.479
 sent a personal message so that the 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:03.349
 who wants to do the era but before that 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.809
 part of sancor be short here and if not 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.999
 there is no one good as well many 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:09.709

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:16.909
 past videos the altars put them in 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.709
 videos and well that would be all many 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.899
 thanks for being there but not following 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.709
