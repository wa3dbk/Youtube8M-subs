so<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.820> never<00:00:03.090> saw<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.480> powerlines<00:00:03.899> now<00:00:04.110> behind

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
so I never saw the powerlines now behind

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.300 
so I never saw the powerlines now behind
me

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
me

it's<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.120> low-flying

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.020 

look<00:00:32.400> at<00:00:32.519> that<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:33.800> missing<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> floor<00:00:38.030> go

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
look at that just missing the floor go

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.729 
look at that just missing the floor go
judge<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.480> depth<00:00:39.720> perception<00:00:39.809> no<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.589> hit

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
see how slow see how fast we go to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:32.279 
see how slow see how fast we go to
circle<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:27.130> about<00:01:27.280> 3/4<00:01:28.000> throttle<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:32.170> go

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.919 
circle it's about 3/4 throttle don't go
much<00:01:32.440> faster<00:01:32.649> because<00:01:33.009> I'm<00:01:33.810> misjudge<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
trees trees just look like a blur to me

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.850 
trees trees just look like a blur to me
the<00:01:38.170> moment

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.430 

whoa<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:44.140> close<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.840> you're<00:01:46.990> focusing

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
whoa that's close well you're focusing

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.780 
whoa that's close well you're focusing
like<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.710> on<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.920> play<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.310> trees<00:01:48.580> is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
like that on the play the trees is

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
like that on the play the trees is
ladies<00:01:49.480> a<00:01:49.510> blur

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310

at<00:01:59.940> full<00:02:00.150> throttle<00:02:01.580> its<00:02:02.580> full<00:02:02.850> throat<00:02:03.090> Oh

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
at full throttle its full throat Oh

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.980 
at full throttle its full throat Oh

I<00:02:06.860> will<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.009> down<00:02:08.039> oh<00:02:08.399> good

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.580 

and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.660> we<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:19.810> pick<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:19.990> up<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.290> enough

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
and then we just pick it up now enough

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.540 
and then we just pick it up now enough
of<00:02:20.680> that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.990 

know<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.880> decide<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.240> come<00:02:28.360> back<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.970> some

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
know what decide to come back do some

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.880 
know what decide to come back do some
high-altitude<00:02:31.540> spins<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:44.530> definitely

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
high-altitude spins it's definitely

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.200 
high-altitude spins it's definitely
scary<00:02:45.010> when<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.580> they<00:02:45.730> need<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.030> just

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
scary when you do they need to just

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.460 
scary when you do they need to just
select<00:02:46.300> other<00:02:46.600> sticks<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.080> second<00:02:47.320> for<00:02:47.440> it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
select other sticks for a second for it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.060 
select other sticks for a second for it
to<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:48.070> back<00:02:48.310> Oh<00:02:49.260> show<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.320> do<00:02:50.500> some<00:02:50.680> spins<00:02:50.980> on

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
to get back Oh show you do some spins on

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.840 
to get back Oh show you do some spins on
this<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:54.610> let<00:02:54.790> go<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:57.280> right<00:02:57.460> stick

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
this just let go of the the right stick

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.730 
this just let go of the the right stick
just<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.120> get<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:58.330> back<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:05.290> pretty<00:03:05.530> good<00:03:05.620> at

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
just to get it back it's pretty good at

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:37.640 
just to get it back it's pretty good at
aerobatic<00:03:06.190> display<00:03:06.280> now

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.860 

there's<00:03:38.250> tons<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.790> birds<00:03:38.940> find<00:03:39.330> out<00:03:39.480> there<00:03:39.659> and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
there's tons of birds find out there and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:58.440 
there's tons of birds find out there and
the<00:03:40.080> real<00:03:40.260> plane

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.940 

see<00:03:59.140> how<00:03:59.200> quick<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.470> sizes

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
see how quick that sizes

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.140 
see how quick that sizes
thrust-vectoring<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:06.430> crazy<00:04:06.819> how

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
thrust-vectoring that that's crazy how

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.540 
thrust-vectoring that that's crazy how
quick<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.480> turns<00:04:08.160> they<00:04:09.160> come<00:04:09.310> straight

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
quick that turns they come straight

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.210 
quick that turns they come straight
towards<00:04:09.670> me<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.650> Ted<00:04:11.650> got<00:04:11.920> away<00:04:12.610> from<00:04:12.670> me

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
towards me and Ted got away from me

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:31.950 
towards me and Ted got away from me
he<00:04:15.220> almost<00:04:15.400> stalls<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.150> tests<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:16.690> quick

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.270 

look<00:04:32.960> at<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.169> over<00:04:33.260> oh<00:04:33.710> that's<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:35.630> timer

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
look at that over oh that's my timer

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.159 
look at that over oh that's my timer
I've<00:04:37.280> run<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.669> battery<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.120> bit<00:04:38.330> easier<00:04:39.020> than

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
I've run this battery a bit easier than

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.230 
I've run this battery a bit easier than
the<00:04:39.290> last<00:04:39.350> one<00:04:39.740> because<00:04:39.949> I<00:04:40.340> ran<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:40.970> down<00:04:41.000> to

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the last one because I ran it down to

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.090 
the last one because I ran it down to
like<00:04:41.360> ten<00:04:41.720> point<00:04:42.020> six<00:04:42.199> volts<00:04:42.590> which<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.860> way

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
like ten point six volts which is way

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.719 
like ten point six volts which is way
too<00:04:43.160> low

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
too low

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:56.740 
too low
it's<00:04:44.570> having<00:04:44.750> too<00:04:44.840> much<00:04:44.960> fun<00:04:51.220> pretty<00:04:52.220> good<00:04:55.750> and

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
it's having too much fun pretty good and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.700 
it's having too much fun pretty good and
that's<00:04:57.080> what<00:04:57.169> happens<00:04:57.410> only<00:04:57.470> thoughts

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
that's what happens only thoughts

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:17.379 
that's what happens only thoughts
downwind<00:05:03.190> why<00:05:04.190> don't<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:04.370> do<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:15.880> okay<00:05:16.880> so<00:05:16.940> we

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
downwind why don't I do that okay so we

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.050 
downwind why don't I do that okay so we
put<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.780> David<00:05:18.710> vendor<00:05:19.010> stall<00:05:19.250> nose<00:05:19.760> through

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
put the David vendor stall nose through

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.219 
put the David vendor stall nose through
its<00:05:20.180> test<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:25.550> nose<00:05:25.760> is<00:05:25.970> broken<00:05:26.240> which<00:05:27.050> is

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
its test the nose is broken which is

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.180 
its test the nose is broken which is
kind<00:05:27.410> of<00:05:27.440> annoying<00:05:27.650> because<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.010> is<00:05:28.100> the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
kind of annoying because this is the

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
kind of annoying because this is the
hardest<00:05:28.490> bit<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.729> build<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.789> rest<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
hardest bit to build the rest of the

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.060 
hardest bit to build the rest of the
fuselage<00:05:32.600> is<00:05:32.750> fine<00:05:33.020> apart<00:05:33.410> from<00:05:33.590> its<00:05:33.830> ripped

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
fuselage is fine apart from its ripped

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.730 
fuselage is fine apart from its ripped
out<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:34.400> bit<00:05:34.639> a<00:05:35.350> little<00:05:36.350> bit<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.530> glue

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
out this bit a little bit of glue

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.730 
out this bit a little bit of glue
that'll<00:05:37.039> fix<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:38.289> think<00:05:39.289> it's<00:05:39.380> because<00:05:39.620> I

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
that'll fix it I think it's because I

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.290 
that'll fix it I think it's because I
put<00:05:39.979> a<00:05:40.840> pretty<00:05:41.840> strong<00:05:42.669> like<00:05:43.669> fiber<00:05:44.000> tape
