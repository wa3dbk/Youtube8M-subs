 months you will see one more result 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.159
 natural and definitive complications 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.619
 they are rare because of the pre-strike 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.750
 in the preoperative and care

 results are worthwhile together 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.650
 discuss surgical techniques

 existing and the most suitable for your

 anatomy of each there is no surgery 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.470
 plastic without scars each one has 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.810
 a different healing process 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.690
 that does not depend on the doctor but on the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.750

 it has its projection formed 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.400
 mainly by fatty tissue and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.490
 muscle being the main muscle the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.730
 gluteus maximus see now how 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.950
 performs the gluteoplasty a 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.090
 vertical incision on top 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.520
 of the intergluteal groove the scar remains 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.490
 totally hidden inside the groove 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.340
 between the buttocks by means of said 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.380
 incision the doctor reaches the muscle and 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.470
 create a bag to accommodate the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.070
 prosthesis the prosthesis can be placed 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.730
 on below or inside the gluteal muscle 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.310
 maximum size and best format 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.950
 The prosthesis must be chosen together with 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.560
 another doctor who will indicate the prosthesis 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.010
 ideal for your physical structure that

 gluteoplasty is easily seen 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.959
 after surgery however a 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.600
 most definitive and natural result will be 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.480
 observed in some months 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.060
 post surgical recommendations the use 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.310
 of compressive strips can be indicated 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.280
 in the postoperative period depending on each 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.350
 case the drain use or it can be 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.830
 necessary for the elimination of 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.120
 liquids that form under the skin 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.310
 facilitating healing and 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.310
 promoting faster recovery 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.590
 it is important to keep the region well 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.680
 sanitized by the proximity of the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.440
 incision to a contaminated area follows 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.630
 correctly orientations about you 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.630
