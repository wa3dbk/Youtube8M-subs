00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.640
 no no 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.740
 video today we are in a comparative a 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.810
 little bit unequal everything has to be said 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.390
 but they are two terminals that are being 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.840
 seeing a lot in the market in the is 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.670
 marketing in some massive way 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.829
 everyone is being announced in 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.470
 its moment sony xperia is in the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.840
 left samsung galaxy s2 on the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.340
 right clearly it's not about seeing 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.620
 that ends the best that does not win 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.640
 basically it's like that except for certain 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.770
 aspects 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.989
 the question is whether it is worth paying 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.519
 for the surcharge that sony has with 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.370
 regarding the samsung either with a 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.219
 barbarity are not 300 euros but 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.660
 we want to comment this little this 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.670
 small confrontation between the two 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.890
 terminals to tell you what stands out 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.329
 one and the other especially on what 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.420
 advantages would have the sony on the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.140
 samsung on an aesthetic level the sony has 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.990
 a much more novel design more 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.780
 modern the samsung bet or bet on 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.360
 its time since the current mobile the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.340
 samsung galaxy s3 but it is also true 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 that in terms of price and approach 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.160
 maybe the samsung galaxy s2 is not so 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 away from the son and as it might seem to 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.869
 Priori 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.240
 they both brought brought natively 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 Android 2.3 gingerbread the two are 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.490
 updatable 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.180
 to version 4.0 ice cream sandwich 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.670
 two have 4.3-inch screens 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.299
 that yes the sony has a resolution of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.780
 1280 x 720 and 480 x 800 for the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.320
 samsung sony first advantage for the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 thickness 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 very different 10 to 6 millimeters from 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.000
 8.9 of him 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.430
 the samsung galaxy s2 then as soon as 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.920
 about thickness and weight almost 30 grams 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.990
 less for the samsung the winner is the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 samsung and hamas is one thing that you notice 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.520
 in sounds or 5 hand mode but it's 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.600
 more comfortable to have the samsung if we have 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.600
 2 weighing it or if we're going to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.880
 consider that as something crucial cameras 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.770
 front in both have a 1.3 for 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.450
 megapixel sounds for samsung 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 basically both work well for 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.230
 video calls and facial unlocking that is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.830
 for what they are used but if we give them the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.630
 turn and center the rear cameras 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.480
 Well then we see a small 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.990
 difference 12 megapixels in the sonic 8 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.940
 in the samsung but eye 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.270
 It must be said that the sony camera is 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.000
 slightly better and say that and not say 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.130
 which is brutally better is already a point 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.530
 in favor of the samsung that is the camera 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.780
 of the samsung is possibly the best that 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.250
 has been mounted on an android in the year 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.710
 2011 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.510
 we are in 2012 the sony has done 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.580
 presentation acts with one of 12 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.740
 megapixels with a very good quality the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.320
 answer the software 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.510
 etcetera is to say if we value very much 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.210
 to the camera we may not have to go to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.520
 for the xperia s but if we value only 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.670
 much the camera the two are very good 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.900
 terminals in this aspect you have to 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.550
 consider that they are the two high ranges 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.450
 as for the cameras also in 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.320
 Regarding the rest of benefits 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.180
 obviously and what to have in 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.310
 account more the screen than what is the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.730
 camera both have a processor 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.730
 dual-core is 1.5 for the sony 1.2 for 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.920
 the samsung a giga of ram in both cases 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.520
 a 16 gigs of storage for the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.010
 samsung 32 for the sony but the samsung 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.740
 has a microsd slot that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.380
 we can expand up to 32 in the case of 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.660
 xperia s we have a microsim in the case 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.550
 of the samsung galaxy s2 we have a sim 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.320
 normal is important to you but 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.730
 you will also have to consider it to the 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.020
 time to purchase or change a 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.930
 terminal to another 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.270
 with respect to good software then 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.270
 although both are gingerbread 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.940
 The Samsung Galaxy S2 has been updated 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.850
 officially while the sony xperia 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.730
 s is in it 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.930
 it caught quite the attention we are going to 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.910
 change 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.330
 the brightness of the screen to put it at 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.330
 maximum 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.600
 so you can contrast the two 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.600
 screens in equal conditions 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.770
 the two campaigns are acceptably 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.040
 good things that happen on the samsung 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.460
 galaxy s2 as the amoled because it has a 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.990
 bluish greenish tone of the sony with the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.750
 Bravia motor has a lot of colors 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.790
 more real apart from that of course the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.460
 resolution is much better is that of 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.240
 verse nor the answer however 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.790
 it's pretty validating the two does not give us 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.790
 no kind of problems 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.190
 as you see 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.560
 obviously there are more there are more than 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.830
 difference the nfc chip for example that 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.050
 has the son and that does not have samsung the 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.390
 micro hdmi output that has are and that 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.430
 does not have samsung either 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.380
 etcetera is not to say we are before two 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.150
 terminals that can be comparable 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.890
 in the sense that they are the two ranges 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.020
 highs have been designed for an audience 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.420
 demanding they have android will be updated 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.770
 the last good version to the last 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.410
 we do not know if officially since the 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.240
 last one is already android 4.1 and elvin and not 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.220
 they are the 4.0 ice cream sandwich 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.380
 it's worth changing from samsung to 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.099
 sony xperia that man because everything is a 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.780
 question of money is to say but a 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:11.090
 problem for us if they are and is a 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.169
 mobile better but if it's not something 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.780
 pressing if we're not going to get it out much 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:20.310
 match to the nfc characteristics to the 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.020
 12 megapixel camera or output 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.289
 of micro hdmi if the screen for 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.699
 we are not an important reason for 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.740
 change of mobile because maybe with the 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.930
 samsung galaxy s2 we can hold a 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.699
 more time that is to say we always 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.520
 we advise that in a general way 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:38.250
 we change terminals every two 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.199
 generations however many of the 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.479
 that we compose so we change every six 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.819
 or eight months not but let's say that a 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.949
 terminal becomes obsolete really to 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.159
 the two years and by obsolete we understand 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.560
 that there are many improvements that could 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.960
 benefit but not that we serve the 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.099
 mobile at all there are first phones 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.539
 generation with android that are 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.800
 perfectly operational now the 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.990
 question is what are we going to use it for? 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.260
 whatsapp social networks and little else by 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.710
 any android mobile almost 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.630
 now we are going to ask me a lot about 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.600
 everything in the multimedia section then 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.340
 if it's worth going to the new sony 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.750
 xperia that if you have any doubt already 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.510
 you know you can not leave it in the 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.830
 comments of the post and also in the 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.100
 referring these mobile web any 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.800
 another operating system or device with 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.300
 Android or with another system in fort 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.300
 mobile dotcom greetings
