00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
in my browser on the same network type

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.269 
in my browser on the same network type
in<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.500> address<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.279> specified<00:00:20.550> here

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
in the address that was specified here

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
in the address that was specified here
ok<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.519> now<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.240> i<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.779> i<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.350> draw

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
ok and now what i can do is i can draw

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.390 
ok and now what i can do is i can draw
here<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.960> shows<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.410> right<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:29.010> when

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
here and it shows up right here when

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
here and it shows up right here when
little<00:00:29.730> bit<00:00:29.880> delayed<00:00:30.179> depends<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.810> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
little bit delayed depends on your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.179 
little bit delayed depends on your
network<00:00:31.289> sometimes<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.890> better<00:00:32.040> sometimes

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
network sometimes it's better sometimes

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.799 
network sometimes it's better sometimes
it's<00:00:33.800> worse<00:00:34.820> anyways<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.630> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's worse anyways what you can do is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.740 
it's worse anyways what you can do is
very<00:00:37.079> easily<00:00:38.329> switch<00:00:39.329> colors<00:00:41.120> ok<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.600> do

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
very easily switch colors ok you can do

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
very easily switch colors ok you can do
different<00:00:42.960> types<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.559> strokes<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
different types of strokes this is a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.069 
different types of strokes this is a
little<00:00:46.079> finer<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.920> example<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.480> what's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
little finer for example but then what's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.979 
little finer for example but then what's
really<00:00:49.500> cool<00:00:49.739> let<00:00:50.370> me<00:00:50.399> erase<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.539> there's<00:00:51.870> an

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
really cool let me erase this there's an

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.000 
really cool let me erase this there's an
eraser<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:53.449> I<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.930> take<00:00:55.110> photos<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.829> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
eraser to I can take photos so for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
eraser to I can take photos so for
example<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.660> new<00:00:57.750> language<00:00:58.079> center

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
example this is the new language center

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.599 
example this is the new language center
hear<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.930> can<00:01:00.930> specify<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:02.010> big<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.370> want

there's a trial version that is free and
then<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:27.359> actual<00:02:27.840> app<00:02:28.079> costs<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.829> 99<00:02:29.370> which

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
then the actual app costs for 99 which

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.099 
then the actual app costs for 99 which
is<00:02:30.290> not<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> expensive<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:32.310> believe<00:02:32.609> for

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
is not that expensive I believe for

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.509 
is not that expensive I believe for
almost<00:02:34.109> a<00:02:34.290> virtual<00:02:34.650> whiteboard<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:35.129> wish<00:02:35.310> that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
you could type over this but it seems

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.770 
you could type over this but it seems

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
that they've been updating this is still

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.479
