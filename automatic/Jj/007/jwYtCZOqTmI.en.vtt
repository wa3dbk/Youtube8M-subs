00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.950
 9 to all guys here on xd xd if you're in 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.740
 I will show you this video tutorial 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 how to play the black ops black song 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.880
 ops 2 that you can listen to in the room 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.590
 zombie lobby on the piano 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 then we must say that it takes place between 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 the do and the yes plus if we remember the do magg 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.529
 the doc and we will call C major air 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.409
 which we shall call major and sissi king 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.470
 minor ok let's start as first thing there 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:28.109
 we position in this way or yes yes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.409
 do minor and we have to do this 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.409
 melody 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.880
 ok this is the first phase this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.660
 phase the turning point twice e 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.660
 will become so 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.809
 having done this first piece we move on to 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.210
 second, that is, all the fingers move 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.710
 of an except the thumb for which the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.410
 thumb stays on wii 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.710
 the index scale on the dock is the average goes 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.960
 the same ethic is done on the C major 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.610
 what, however, once for once 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 now there is the variation or 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.890
 not that you understood this passage 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.970
 here it must be done three times then 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.540
 putting it all together 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.540
 it comes like this 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.600
 clear the end of the third time the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.600
 passage that ends this way 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.660
 we will have to scale two or 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.390
 he is understanding B-flat soul 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
 r these thirty if they will be pressed 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.050
 in the same way in fact this song 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.180
 it's a song that needs to be done all in 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.220
 the same way though the keys 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 they will always be different then 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.959
 let's continue we're here climb down col 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.850
 average and we position ourselves in this way 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.600
 we move the index and continue to 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.600
 take them 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.330
 we will return to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.250
 return June we return to for 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.250
 the last time 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.790
 and we will do the last step or the three 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.790
 black keys 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.790
 the song will start over here now 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.500
 but there is nothing left but 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.610
 put it all together 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.610
 then let's start 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.860
 good guys 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.079

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.689
 lobby zombie room the blackhawks and black
