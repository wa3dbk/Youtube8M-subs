00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
was that if you remember from my

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.620 
was that if you remember from my
previous<00:01:54.840> gear<00:01:55.259> video<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.939> wasn't<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
previous gear video it was it wasn't a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.899 
previous gear video it was it wasn't a
circular<00:01:58.530> shape<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.840> bent<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.380> edges<00:02:01.909> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
circular shape I just bent some edges to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.280 
circular shape I just bent some edges to
make<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> little<00:02:03.509> bit<00:02:03.689> more<00:02:04.079> sturdier<00:02:05.090> and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
make it a little bit more sturdier and

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.180 
make it a little bit more sturdier and
also<00:02:07.369> it's<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.910> easier<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.869> store<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.739> can

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
also it's it's easier to store I can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.660 
also it's it's easier to store I can
fold<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.580> up

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
fold it up

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.570 
fold it up
it<00:02:13.670> becomes<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.560> flat<00:02:15.560> piece<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:16.010> aluminum

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it becomes a flat piece of aluminum

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.509 
it becomes a flat piece of aluminum
aluminum<00:02:16.909> there<00:02:17.980> one<00:02:18.980> thing<00:02:19.129> I<00:02:19.250> didn't

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
aluminum there one thing I didn't

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.860 
aluminum there one thing I didn't

my entire thru-hike but it they also

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.380 
my entire thru-hike but it they also
take<00:02:31.310> heat<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.709> find<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.040> at<00:02:34.390> hardware

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
take heat you can find this at hardware

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.880 
take heat you can find this at hardware
stores<00:02:37.239> they<00:02:38.239> will<00:02:38.390> they<00:02:38.659> both<00:02:38.810> work<00:02:39.110> work

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890

great I think I prefer the denatured
alcohol<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:44.299> it's<00:02:44.900> really<00:02:45.829> easy<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.220> find

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
alcohol just it's really easy to find

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.240 
alcohol just it's really easy to find
all<00:02:47.269> along<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.750> way<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.260> can't<00:02:48.859> really<00:02:49.069> tell

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
all along the way and can't really tell

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.530 
all along the way and can't really tell
a<00:02:49.299> performance<00:02:50.299> difference<00:02:50.950> between<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.069> two

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
a performance difference between the two

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.190 
a performance difference between the two
I<00:02:53.540> did<00:02:54.349> use<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:55.329> contact<00:02:56.329> solution<00:02:56.569> dropper

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
I did use that contact solution dropper

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.849 
I did use that contact solution dropper
the<00:02:58.190> entire<00:02:58.489> way<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.569> think<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.500> was<00:03:00.709> an

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
the entire way and I think that was an

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.680 
the entire way and I think that was an
awesome<00:03:01.430> way<00:03:01.849> to<00:03:01.909> store<00:03:02.440> my<00:03:03.440> alcohol<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.690> could

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
awesome way to store my alcohol I could

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.830 
awesome way to store my alcohol I could
tell<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.040> tell<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.099> apart<00:03:07.250> from<00:03:07.519> my<00:03:07.970> water

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
tell it tell it apart from my water

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.020 
tell it tell it apart from my water
bottle<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.560> didn't<00:03:09.950> confuse<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.609> two<00:03:10.819> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
bottle so I didn't confuse the two and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.920 
bottle so I didn't confuse the two and
also<00:03:11.659> I<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.859> dropper<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:14.209> was<00:03:14.690> great

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
