00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them from 1:21 each so let's take a look

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.110 
them from 1:21 each so let's take a look
at<00:02:23.660> my<00:02:23.750> cache<00:02:23.960> tech<00:02:24.200> 442<00:02:25.100> K<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.670> if<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.910> take<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
at my cache tech 442 K and if we take a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.210 
at my cache tech 442 K and if we take a
look<00:02:26.330> at<00:02:26.420> my<00:02:26.540> history<00:02:26.960> log<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.650> earned<00:02:27.980> me

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
look at my history log this earned me

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.300

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
about 35 K so burns are really worth it

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.150 
about 35 K so burns are really worth it
and<00:02:31.510> ripped<00:02:32.510> my<00:02:32.630> cache<00:02:33.020> deck<00:02:33.320> well<00:02:33.620> not<00:02:33.950> really

to<00:02:38.720> lose<00:02:38.900> 30k<00:02:39.470> unfortunately<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:40.700> let's<00:02:40.910> try

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
to lose 30k unfortunately now let's try

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.120 
to lose 30k unfortunately now let's try
some<00:02:41.390> raw<00:02:41.630> sharks<00:02:42.140> since<00:02:42.380> swordfish<00:02:42.950> are

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
some raw sharks since swordfish are

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.800 
some raw sharks since swordfish are
pretty<00:02:43.430> bad<00:02:43.670> at<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.970> moment<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:44.780> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
pretty bad at the moment so this is a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.560 
pretty bad at the moment so this is a
448<00:02:45.710> K<00:02:45.980> investment<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.730> let's<00:02:47.090> try<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.450> make

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
448 K investment and let's try and make

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.220 
448 K investment and let's try and make
a<00:02:47.600> 10k<00:02:48.140> profit<00:02:48.650> yes<00:02:49.490> they<00:02:49.970> worked<00:02:50.390> let's<00:02:50.959> try

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
a 10k profit yes they worked let's try

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.250 
a 10k profit yes they worked let's try
them<00:02:51.410> again<00:02:51.940> 458<00:02:52.940> K<00:02:53.150> investment<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.900> let's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
them again 458 K investment and let's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.340 
them again 458 K investment and let's
try<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.620> make<00:02:54.740> another<00:02:54.980> 10<00:02:55.310> K<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:57.080> made

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
try and make another 10 K and I made

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.530 
try and make another 10 K and I made
about<00:02:57.590> 9<00:02:57.860> K<00:02:58.100> off<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.640> that's<00:02:59.060> still<00:02:59.390> not

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
about 9 K off of them that's still not

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.260 
about 9 K off of them that's still not
bad<00:02:59.810> at<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.770> bought<00:03:01.160> 968<00:03:02.090> raw

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
bad at all so I just bought 968 raw

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.480 
bad at all so I just bought 968 raw
swordfish<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.990> if<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.440> flip<00:03:03.740> is<00:03:03.890> successful

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
swordfish and if this flip is successful

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.030 
swordfish and if this flip is successful
this<00:03:04.640> will<00:03:04.820> be<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.030> 9<00:03:05.330> K<00:03:05.630> profit<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.440> they<00:03:06.980> were

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
this will be a 9 K profit and they were

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.670 
this will be a 9 K profit and they were
successful<00:03:07.490> just<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.480> hoped<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.350> bought

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680

more soul runes and managed to earn an
8k<00:03:11.900> profit<00:03:12.380> for<00:03:12.800> only<00:03:13.100> purchasing<00:03:13.610> 911<00:03:14.540> of

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
8k profit for only purchasing 911 of

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.240 
8k profit for only purchasing 911 of
them<00:03:14.810> which<00:03:15.170> was<00:03:15.410> very<00:03:15.680> decent

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
them which was very decent

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.640 
them which was very decent
so<00:03:16.550> steel<00:03:16.940> arrow<00:03:17.209> tips<00:03:17.570> crashed<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.230> little<00:03:18.500> bit

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
so steel arrow tips crashed a little bit

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.740 
so steel arrow tips crashed a little bit
and<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.920> bought<00:03:19.160> over<00:03:19.340> 6<00:03:19.820> K<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.300> them<00:03:20.450> for<00:03:20.720> only

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.330 
25 coins each so making steel arrows
will<00:03:23.750> finally<00:03:24.170> make<00:03:24.320> money<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.830> this<00:03:25.130> will

all of them and 226 K is the total after

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.750 
all of them and 226 K is the total after

money I received from the swordfish flip

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.290 
money I received from the swordfish flip
a<00:04:31.880> little<00:04:32.120> bit<00:04:32.240> ago<00:04:32.650> take<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.180> there<00:04:35.180> we

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
a little bit ago take that and there we

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.400 
a little bit ago take that and there we
go<00:04:35.480> 314<00:04:36.230> K<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.650> we're<00:04:37.070> at<00:04:37.480> 648<00:04:38.480> K<00:04:38.750> cash<00:04:39.110> stack

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
go 314 K and we're at 648 K cash stack

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.680 
go 314 K and we're at 648 K cash stack
so<00:04:40.250> sapphire<00:04:40.760> bolts<00:04:41.120> currently<00:04:41.510> have<00:04:41.660> a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
so sapphire bolts currently have a

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.320 
so sapphire bolts currently have a
margin<00:04:42.170> of<00:04:42.320> 46<00:04:42.920> coins<00:04:43.310> but<00:04:43.730> this<00:04:43.940> may<00:04:44.150> be<00:04:44.180> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
margin of 46 coins but this may be a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.870 
margin of 46 coins but this may be a
risky<00:04:44.750> flip<00:04:45.050> just<00:04:45.650> did<00:04:45.890> a<00:04:45.920> flip<00:04:46.160> with<00:04:46.370> coal<00:04:46.610> and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
risky flip just did a flip with coal and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.360 
risky flip just did a flip with coal and
that<00:04:47.090> earned<00:04:47.300> me<00:04:47.420> 10<00:04:47.720> K<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:47.960> bought<00:04:48.290> 3.3<00:04:49.040> K<00:04:49.220> of

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
that earned me 10 K I bought 3.3 K of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.780 
that earned me 10 K I bought 3.3 K of
them<00:04:49.580> for<00:04:49.820> 131<00:04:50.630> each<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.080> then<00:04:51.260> sold<00:04:51.530> them<00:04:51.650> for

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
them for 131 each and then sold them for

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.110 
them for 131 each and then sold them for
134<00:04:52.790> each<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:53.900> bought<00:04:54.200> more<00:04:54.500> coal<00:04:54.830> 3.3<00:04:55.640> K<00:04:55.850> and

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
134 each so I bought more coal 3.3 K and

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.030 
134 each so I bought more coal 3.3 K and
I<00:04:56.210> actually<00:04:56.450> canceled<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.260> sapphire<00:04:57.710> bolts

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
I actually canceled the sapphire bolts

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.370 
I actually canceled the sapphire bolts
offer<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.580> only<00:04:58.850> lost<00:04:59.090> 5<00:04:59.390> K<00:04:59.660> on<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.140> I<00:05:00.170> did

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
offer I only lost 5 K on it but I did

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.170 
offer I only lost 5 K on it but I did
