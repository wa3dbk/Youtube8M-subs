00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.199
 come and serve us at the acts of the water meal 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.279
 we introduce it more everyone knows it I decided to test mayzaud 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.619
 Ben Hamidi with copa 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.550
 the levels and why not page is the bolt of the gift I am too old 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 too late and no longer 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.109
 but there is no longer parity to the point that I can perhaps have one 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.040
 muscle 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.210
 we get in the car we go to ferrari 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.220
 we get information they will unfortunately little stubborn news 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.030
 so good a request 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 what ferrari I had before 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330
 on the back and we do not have the network 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.320
 the gap is like that 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.740
 they asked me for my book of mormon 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.070
 I must say that I love them 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.860
 and I waited a month and a half 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.660
 to see for permission 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.330
 I started in May 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.120
 and a month and a half after months bombs away at mco 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.909
 so I let myself go further he adds that we like 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.370
 it's in the month of September the 25th 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.860
 September 2nd 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770
 I use them often 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.280
 the north two% and charitable events like patronage I 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.690
 cardiac 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.400
 obliging for cancer dependent for them 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.130
 children's diseases but it is fun 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.910
 passionate kids me it's nice to please the kind 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.390
 for my part I will show you 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.620
 Montreal's most beautiful thing 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.620
 in the car it's done 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 following this summer on the water 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 all carbon everywhere 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.590
 the rear 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 hours 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.930
 but beyond reason against the world of series 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.709
 the hail storms in the doubs 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.159
 it's a question of looking behind the continued slowdown 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.699
 the sale took place 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
 I must never leave her power 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.789
 even with a name like this drama 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.139
 why the campaign 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 will you 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.159
 1 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.629
 the monks have been reserved 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.869
 we are far from resolved 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.159
 last week 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.510
 the answer is it's 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.829
 that's why we like 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.829
 dozens of dead 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.129
 cameron 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.989
 the first day of forgiveness 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.989
 their union 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.029
 voices rise 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 to have regrets 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.579
 in euros 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.409
 nothing
