00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.220
 the first 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.419
 With that, it was clear that the rebel offensive 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.169
 this is a product that fits perfectly into lifestyle 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.119
 primarily swimmers who want to keep their bodies on travel 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.099
 integers 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.259
 its design is very practical easy to handle resembling somewhat the format 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.839
 goalkeepers with a blade, however the neighborhood where it is not indicated for a 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:26.589
 war 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.859
 then you will wonder in which body locations I can use the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.269
 according to the user manual this data can be used to cut 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.850
 person anywhere in the body 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.480
 below the neck 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.470
 there goes from the taste of each one since it has been heated in the internal until vilhena the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.960
 that you think it should as I said each one each 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.850
 the functioning of the barigui differ greatly from the female detonators that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.600
 pulled the turkey by the root 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.060
 in fact the barrel works the same way as a blade only with a lot 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.420
 more security 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 note that there are several blades here inside the pilot enters so it is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 difficult to suppose that it is cut by the lateral movement in high 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.620
 speed of the blades the result is a sick epilation but with or at 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.070
 has not been extracted, maintenance must take place almost every day since 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.680
 the little ones will grow like beards 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.060
 you can also use the wall to simply trim the hair for this 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.080
 use one of the three adapter combs that determine the author of the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.960
 very positive point of the barrel is that you can use the ambassador in the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.460
 However, it was easy to see that the best results are achieved with the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.840
 dry skin 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 a cool tip if you want to use the bathroom is to always have around foam 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.410
 to shave 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.120
 one more thing as electric shavers do not expect the best 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.240
 barrel results the first time students generally skin needs a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.080
 some time to adapt 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.960
 it takes eight hours to charge and each charge lasts around 50 minutes 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.640
