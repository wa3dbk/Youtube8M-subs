all right hey guys what's up this is a
little<00:00:15.100> 4:35<00:00:15.789> and<00:00:16.059> due<00:00:16.630> to<00:00:16.750> some<00:00:16.960> comments

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
little 4:35 and due to some comments

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.340 
little 4:35 and due to some comments
below<00:00:17.740> in<00:00:18.039> my<00:00:18.150> previous<00:00:19.150> videos<00:00:19.510> people<00:00:20.140> have

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
below in my previous videos people have

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.140 
below in my previous videos people have
been<00:00:20.529> suggesting<00:00:21.220> that<00:00:21.369> I<00:00:21.430> do<00:00:21.580> some<00:00:21.939> more

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
been suggesting that I do some more

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.499 
been suggesting that I do some more
annihilation<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.759> somebody<00:00:24.759> suggested<00:00:25.300> that

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
annihilation and somebody suggested that

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.550 
annihilation and somebody suggested that
I<00:00:25.929> should<00:00:26.169> do<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.939> tips<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.449> tricks<00:00:28.630> so<00:00:29.529> I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
I should do some tips and tricks so I

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.790 
I should do some tips and tricks so I
felt<00:00:30.070> like<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:30.999> had<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.720> decent<00:00:32.020> amount<00:00:32.290> of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
felt like that I had a decent amount of

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.440 
felt like that I had a decent amount of
tips<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.460> I<00:00:33.579> could<00:00:33.790> give<00:00:33.940> you<00:00:33.970> guys<00:00:34.210> in

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
tips that I could give you guys in

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.340 
tips that I could give you guys in
annihilation

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
annihilation

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.119 
annihilation
so<00:00:36.130> the<00:00:36.520> first<00:00:36.760> one<00:00:37.000> off<00:00:37.210> here<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:38.800> we<00:00:38.980> can

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
so the first one off here is if we can

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.380 
so the first one off here is if we can
stop<00:00:39.399> lagging<00:00:39.670> terribly<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.359> speed<00:00:43.359> up

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
stop lagging terribly is how to speed up

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.670 
stop lagging terribly is how to speed up
breaking<00:00:43.840> a<00:00:44.079> nexus<00:00:44.590> without<00:00:45.899> efficiency<00:00:46.899> so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
breaking a nexus without efficiency so

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.990 
breaking a nexus without efficiency so
this<00:00:47.920> is<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.280> can<00:00:48.489> be<00:00:48.519> done<00:00:48.820> without

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
this is this can be done without

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.919 
this is this can be done without
efficiency<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.870> can<00:00:49.989> be<00:00:50.109> done<00:00:50.289> with<00:00:50.469> any<00:00:50.649> class

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
efficiency it can be done with any class

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.500 
efficiency it can be done with any class
so<00:00:52.929> what<00:00:53.050> you're<00:00:53.170> going<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.320> want<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.500> do<00:00:53.649> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
so what you're going to want to do is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.200 
so what you're going to want to do is
come<00:00:55.510> up<00:00:55.660> here<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.410> then<00:00:56.890> jump<00:00:57.190> up<00:00:57.370> on<00:00:57.579> here

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
come up here and then jump up on here

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.590 
come up here and then jump up on here
and<00:00:58.449> then<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.199> jump<00:00:59.500> up<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.179> on<00:01:01.179> top<00:01:01.449> of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
and then you can jump up and on top of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.810 
and then you can jump up and on top of
here<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:01.839> then<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.440> just<00:01:02.500> jump<00:01:03.070> up<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.429> click

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
here and then you just jump up and click

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.790 
here and then you just jump up and click
that<00:01:03.999> now<00:01:04.839> you're<00:01:04.989> just<00:01:05.110> going<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.379> need<00:01:05.470> any

done but now we're just gonna we're

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.770 
done but now we're just gonna we're
gonna<00:01:14.619> do<00:01:14.829> a<00:01:14.860> previous<00:01:15.369> test<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:16.030> already<00:01:16.600> put

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
gonna do a previous test I already put

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.200 
gonna do a previous test I already put
speed<00:01:17.079> on<00:01:17.229> for<00:01:17.500> our<00:01:17.619> team<00:01:17.829> but<00:01:18.640> here<00:01:19.030> is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
speed on for our team but here is

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.420 
speed on for our team but here is
breaking<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.840> nexus<00:01:20.259> with<00:01:20.409> an<00:01:20.590> efficiency<00:01:21.070> one

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
breaking a nexus with an efficiency one

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.690 
breaking a nexus with an efficiency one
pick<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.470> stone<00:01:23.799> efficiency<00:01:24.490> want

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
pick so this is a stone efficiency want

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.730 
pick so this is a stone efficiency want
pick<00:01:24.909> comes<00:01:25.210> with<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.509> minor<00:01:25.780> class<00:01:26.140> so

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
pick comes with the minor class so

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.609 
pick comes with the minor class so
that's<00:01:26.920> how<00:01:27.100> fast<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.579> is<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.750> we'll<00:01:29.140> jump<00:01:29.409> up

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
that's how fast it is now we'll jump up

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.710 
that's how fast it is now we'll jump up
and<00:01:29.829> put<00:01:30.310> haste<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:31.149> see<00:01:31.420> if<00:01:31.540> it's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
and put haste in and then see if it's

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.590 
and put haste in and then see if it's
any<00:01:31.899> faster<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:33.579> now<00:01:33.670> we've<00:01:33.850> got<00:01:34.060> haste<00:01:34.360> on

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
any faster so now we've got haste on

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.090 
any faster so now we've got haste on
should<00:01:35.320> come<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.710> pretty<00:01:35.920> quick<00:01:36.219> here<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
should come up pretty quick here and you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.850 
should come up pretty quick here and you
know<00:01:39.219> it's<00:01:39.399> a<00:01:39.490> little<00:01:39.579> bit<00:01:39.790> faster<00:01:39.969> it<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.960> can

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
know it's a little bit faster it can can

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.679 
know it's a little bit faster it can can
really<00:01:41.890> help<00:01:42.219> you<00:01:42.369> out<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:46.479> pretty

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
really help you out so that's pretty

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.139 
really help you out so that's pretty
good<00:01:46.869> I<00:01:47.310> suggest<00:01:48.310> doing<00:01:48.399> this<00:01:48.670> if<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.000> have

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
good I suggest doing this if you have

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.880 
good I suggest doing this if you have
like<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> bunch<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.780> people<00:01:49.930> with<00:01:50.170> regular<00:01:50.409> gold

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
like a bunch of people with regular gold

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.450 
like a bunch of people with regular gold
picks<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.780> want<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.170> raid<00:01:53.979> somebody's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
picks and you want to raid somebody's

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.090 
picks and you want to raid somebody's
Nexus<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.090> we're<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:55.270> gonna<00:01:55.539> put<00:01:56.140> speed<00:01:56.799> back

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
Nexus so we're just gonna put speed back

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.660 
Nexus so we're just gonna put speed back
on<00:01:57.340> there<00:01:57.729> just<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:59.250> nobody<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.430> mine

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
on there just so that nobody can mine

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.590 
on there just so that nobody can mine
our<00:02:00.700> Nexus<00:02:01.360> faster<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.979> we'll<00:02:03.939> see<00:02:04.210> if<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.420> can

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
our Nexus faster so we'll see if we can

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.020 
our Nexus faster so we'll see if we can
tell<00:02:04.840> when<00:02:05.140> we<00:02:05.350> lose<00:02:05.560> haste<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:09.000> anyways<00:02:10.000> guys

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
tell when we lose haste so anyways guys

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.990 
tell when we lose haste so anyways guys
that's<00:02:11.020> that's<00:02:11.650> been<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.010> tip<00:02:12.280> for<00:02:12.940> today

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
that's that's been the tip for today

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's that's been the tip for today
I'll<00:02:13.959> probably<00:02:14.319> be<00:02:14.560> continuing<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.220> tip

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I'll probably be continuing the tip

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.369
