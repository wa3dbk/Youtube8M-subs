00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
sure you'll get more devouring place

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.610 
sure you'll get more devouring place
with<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:06.610> spirits<00:04:07.000> but<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:08.140> get<00:04:08.260> an<00:04:08.350> extra

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
with the spirits but you get an extra

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.560 
with the spirits but you get an extra
dot<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.459> don't<00:04:09.700> have<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:09.970> worry<00:04:10.150> about<00:04:10.300> it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
dot and you don't have to worry about it

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.960 
dot and you don't have to worry about it
and<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.900> can<00:04:11.080> maintain<00:04:11.470> your<00:04:11.790> rotation<00:04:12.790> as

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
and you can maintain your rotation as

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.350 
and you can maintain your rotation as
you<00:04:13.030> always<00:04:13.660> would

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
you always would

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.080 
you always would
now<00:04:16.110> let<00:04:16.680> let's<00:04:17.010> go<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.400> rotation<00:04:17.880> for<00:04:18.030> a

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
now let let's go to the rotation for a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.680 
now let let's go to the rotation for a
little<00:04:18.299> bit<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:19.670> there<00:04:20.670> really<00:04:20.850> isn't<00:04:21.150> much

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
little bit so there really isn't much

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.320 
little bit so there really isn't much
that<00:04:21.750> has<00:04:22.140> changed<00:04:22.830> about<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:24.030> unfortunately

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
that has changed about it unfortunately

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.110 
that has changed about it unfortunately
these<00:04:24.840> are<00:04:25.020> 85<00:04:25.470> si<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.100> really<00:04:26.670> don't<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.090> to

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
these are 85 si I really don't want to

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.940

playing<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.960> want<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.470> try<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.680> remake<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.850> and

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
playing I want to try to remake this and

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.220 
playing I want to try to remake this and
do<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.840> lot<00:04:46.320> better<00:04:46.500> job<00:04:47.060> so<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.780> first<00:04:49.020> thing

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
do a lot better job so the first thing

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.050 
do a lot better job so the first thing
that<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.500> probably<00:04:49.710> well<00:04:50.130> actually<00:04:50.490> there's

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
that you probably well actually there's

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.200 
that you probably well actually there's
a<00:04:51.150> couple<00:04:51.360> glyphs<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.900> here<00:04:52.170> that<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.680> saw<00:04:53.210> that

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
a couple glyphs in here that I saw that

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.560 
a couple glyphs in here that I saw that
are<00:04:54.510> really<00:04:55.200> really<00:04:55.800> nice<00:04:56.010> but<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.760> don't<00:04:57.390> think

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
are really really nice but I don't think

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.120 
are really really nice but I don't think
that<00:04:57.750> they<00:04:57.960> would<00:04:58.650> be<00:04:58.680> very<00:04:59.360> very<00:05:00.360> good<00:05:01.130> well

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
that they would be very very good well

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.480 
that they would be very very good well
they're<00:05:02.490> very<00:05:02.520> nice<00:05:03.060> but<00:05:06.890> there<00:05:07.890> was<00:05:07.980> one<00:05:08.250> I

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
they're very nice but there was one I

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.730 
they're very nice but there was one I
forget<00:05:08.940> what<00:05:09.090> it's<00:05:09.210> called<00:05:09.290> but<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.530> pretty

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
forget what it's called but it pretty

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.000 
forget what it's called but it pretty
much<00:05:10.890> they<00:05:11.880> might<00:05:12.030> introduce<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.630> in<00:05:13.010> warlords

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
much they might introduce it in warlords

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.860 
much they might introduce it in warlords
actually<00:05:14.370> where<00:05:15.150> your<00:05:15.990> mind<00:05:16.320> blast<00:05:16.620> generates

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
actually where your mind blast generates

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.659 
actually where your mind blast generates
three<00:05:18.980> mine<00:05:19.980> or<00:05:20.450> shadow<00:05:21.450> orbs<00:05:21.800> when<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:23.370> pull

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
three mine or shadow orbs when you pull

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.640 
three mine or shadow orbs when you pull
like<00:05:23.940> as<00:05:24.390> you're<00:05:24.660> entering<00:05:24.810> combat<00:05:25.260> your

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
like as you're entering combat your

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.830 
like as you're entering combat your
first<00:05:25.890> mind<00:05:26.220> blast<00:05:26.669> will<00:05:26.850> generate<00:05:27.150> three

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
first mind blast will generate three

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.080 
first mind blast will generate three
that<00:05:28.440> way<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.650> can<00:05:28.980> fire<00:05:29.250> off<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.550> devouring

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
that way you can fire off the devouring

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.360 
that way you can fire off the devouring
plague<00:05:30.240> right<00:05:30.810> there<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.140> then<00:05:31.350> which<00:05:32.100> is

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
plague right there and then which is

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.780 
plague right there and then which is
great<00:05:32.910> for<00:05:33.180> Bert<00:05:33.390> well<00:05:33.780> yeah<00:05:34.560> burst<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:35.160> only

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
great for Bert well yeah burst but only

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.850 
great for Bert well yeah burst but only
at<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> beginning<00:05:36.419> of<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.900> fight<00:05:37.140> but<00:05:37.650> the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
at the beginning of the fight but the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.000 
at the beginning of the fight but the
thing<00:05:38.310> is<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.760> increases<00:05:39.480> your<00:05:39.840> cooldown<00:05:40.800> of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
thing is it increases your cooldown of

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.230 
thing is it increases your cooldown of
Mind<00:05:41.820> Blast

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
Mind Blast

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.950 
Mind Blast
for<00:05:42.540> like<00:05:42.830> four<00:05:43.830> seconds<00:05:44.190> that's<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.300> long<00:05:45.570> time

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
for like four seconds that's a long time

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.409 
for like four seconds that's a long time
and<00:05:46.410> that's<00:05:47.340> throughout<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.820> entire<00:05:48.090> fight

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
and that's throughout the entire fight

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.070 
and that's throughout the entire fight
not<00:05:49.290> worth<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.740> if<00:05:50.190> they<00:05:50.430> only<00:05:50.760> edit<00:05:51.120> it<00:05:51.270> where

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
not worth it if they only edit it where

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.210 
not worth it if they only edit it where
it<00:05:52.320> increases<00:05:52.560> your<00:05:53.960> shadow<00:05:54.960> orbs<00:05:55.320> generated

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
it increases your shadow orbs generated

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.990 
it increases your shadow orbs generated
great<00:05:57.090> that<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.840> a<00:05:57.870> great<00:05:58.260> way<00:05:58.470> to<00:05:58.500> help<00:05:58.860> us<00:05:59.130> try
