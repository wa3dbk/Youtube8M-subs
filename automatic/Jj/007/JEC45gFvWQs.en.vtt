I guess you would want to buy on eBay if

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.620 
I guess you would want to buy on eBay if
we<00:04:18.459> really<00:04:18.670> wanted<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.060> complete<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.000

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
there's the back major kibble and still

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:42.900 
there's the back major kibble and still

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
works because of that going doing some

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.520 
works because of that going doing some
more<00:04:43.060> Peaceforce<00:04:43.420> figures<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.080> have<00:04:44.260> and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
maybe some of these figures later let me

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.960 
maybe some of these figures later let me
