this<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.230> number<00:00:04.500> 1<00:00:04.710> number<00:00:05.100> 2<00:00:05.279> number<00:00:05.759> 3

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
this is the number 1 number 2 number 3

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.410 
this is the number 1 number 2 number 3
number<00:00:06.240> 4<00:00:07.519> this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.580> your<00:00:08.820> distributor<00:00:09.389> cap

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
number 4 this is your distributor cap

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.690 
number 4 this is your distributor cap
there's<00:00:10.230> three<00:00:10.469> bolts<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:10.980> he's<00:00:11.099> got<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.280> here

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
there's three bolts so he's got one here

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.660 
there's three bolts so he's got one here
one<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.780> over<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.519> take

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
one here and one over here you just take

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.510 
one here and one over here you just take
those<00:00:14.880> bolts<00:00:15.240> off<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.660> will<00:00:15.839> pop<00:00:16.049> up<00:00:16.520> for

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
those bolts off and this will pop up for

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.160 
those bolts off and this will pop up for
your<00:00:17.670> firing<00:00:18.000> order<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> your<00:00:18.600> distributor

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
your firing order and your distributor

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.650 
your firing order and your distributor
cap<00:00:19.670> usually<00:00:20.670> there's<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:20.939> an<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
cap usually there's like an a with a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
cap usually there's like an a with a
circle<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.369> that'll<00:00:23.730> dignify<00:00:24.180> your

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
circle on it and that'll dignify your

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.679 
circle on it and that'll dignify your
number<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:26.660> distributor<00:00:27.660> pin<00:00:28.279> also<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.730> your

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
number one distributor pin also on your

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.560 
number one distributor pin also on your
cables<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.250> longest<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> shortest<00:00:32.940> one

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
cables go from longest to shortest one

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
cables go from longest to shortest one
being<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.899> longest<00:00:34.050> before<00:00:34.710> being<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
being the longest before being the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
being the longest before being the
shortest<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> before<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> take<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.290> off<00:00:37.410> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
shortest so before you take it off is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500 
shortest so before you take it off is
easiest<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.100> find<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.610> trace<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
easiest way to find it trace it down to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.850 
easiest way to find it trace it down to
here<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.050> again<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.410> should<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> circle

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
here and again there should be a circle

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
here and again there should be a circle
with<00:00:41.070> an<00:00:41.160> A<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.660> firing<00:00:42.899> order

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
with an A on there and the firing order

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.160 
with an A on there and the firing order
goes<00:00:43.410> 1<00:00:44.239> 3<00:00:45.559> 4<00:00:46.559> -<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> engine

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
goes 1 3 4 - it's because the engine

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170 
goes 1 3 4 - it's because the engine
doesn't<00:00:49.379> fire<00:00:49.530> 1<00:00:49.950> 2<00:00:50.129> 3<00:00:50.280> 4<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.940> laid<00:00:51.149> out

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
doesn't fire 1 2 3 4 it just laid out

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.990 
doesn't fire 1 2 3 4 it just laid out
that<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.530> distributor<00:00:53.190> determines<00:00:53.789> by

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that way the distributor determines by

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.619 
that way the distributor determines by
the<00:00:54.059> rotation<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:54.870> goes<00:00:55.520> clockwise

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
the rotation which goes clockwise

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.029 
the rotation which goes clockwise
thrower<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.050> 1<00:00:58.379> 3<00:00:58.850> 4<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.859> got

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
thrower will go 1 3 4 and to think I got

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.250 
thrower will go 1 3 4 and to think I got
that<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.750> again<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> trace<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that right again you can trace your

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230 
that right again you can trace your
cables<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.610> pretty<00:01:05.820> sure<00:01:05.909> that's<00:01:05.970> right

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
cables out I'm pretty sure that's right

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
cables out I'm pretty sure that's right
1<00:01:09.530> at<00:01:10.530> 1<00:01:10.740> 3<00:01:11.040> 4<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> 2<00:01:17.750> ok<00:01:18.750> all's<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.140> did<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:20.119> just

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.350 
1 at 1 3 4 and 2 ok all's I did was just
pull<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> distributor<00:01:21.750> wires<00:01:22.259> off<00:01:23.360> their

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pull the distributor wires off their

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.310 
pull the distributor wires off their
mail<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.580> cap<00:01:27.770> these<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:29.009> female

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.060 

this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.960> probably<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> hardest<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:49.920> get

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this is probably the hardest one you get

this is probably the hardest one you get
to

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.789 

I'm<00:02:01.799> gonna<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.130> careful<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.729> drop<00:02:02.969> her

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
bolts down there it's a real pain to get

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
bolts down there it's a real pain to get
them<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.259> drop<00:02:07.409> them<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.890> part

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
them out if you drop them in this part

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.040 
them out if you drop them in this part
of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> motor

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.390 

I'm<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.200> gonna<00:02:17.320> screw<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.100> under<00:02:18.280> this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
I'm just gonna screw this one under this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.700 
I'm just gonna screw this one under this
one<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.940> think<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.780> guys<00:02:19.960> gonna<00:02:20.170> sit<00:02:20.470> there<00:02:20.650> and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
one I think you guys gonna sit there and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.180 
one I think you guys gonna sit there and
watch<00:02:20.890> me<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:23.040> okay

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
watch me do that okay

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.940 
watch me do that okay
taking<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.580> three<00:02:24.910> volts<00:02:25.210> out<00:02:25.710> there<00:02:26.710> twelve

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
taking the three volts out there twelve

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.190 
taking the three volts out there twelve
millimeter

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
millimeter

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.490 
millimeter
now<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.440> should<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.860> pop<00:02:30.070> right<00:02:30.130> off<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
now that should just pop right off and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:42.710 
now that should just pop right off and
just<00:02:32.680> grab<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.520> kind<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:35.130> pop<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.160> off

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:52.910 

see

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160 

and<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.580> got<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.819> disconnect<00:02:54.480> these<00:02:54.630> connectors

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
and I got a disconnect these connectors

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.559 
and I got a disconnect these connectors
here<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.740> get<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.040> off<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.390> just

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
here so I can get this off or I can just

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.000 
here so I can get this off or I can just
unscrew<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.140> with<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.410> Phillips<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
unscrew this with the Phillips and the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.860 
unscrew this with the Phillips and the
whole<00:02:59.160> thing<00:02:59.370> all<00:03:00.030> those<00:03:00.270> connectors<00:03:00.780> have

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
whole thing all those connectors have

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.840 
whole thing all those connectors have
come<00:03:01.080> off<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.220> should<00:03:02.340> plug<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.670> with<00:03:02.819> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
come off so you should plug that with a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.090 
come off so you should plug that with a
rag<00:03:03.060> cause<00:03:03.360> you're<00:03:03.510> gonna<00:03:03.900> spill<00:03:04.260> out<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.000 

okay<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.340> plug<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> hole<00:03:08.910> hole<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.860> not

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
okay just plug the hole hole so it's not

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.550 
okay just plug the hole hole so it's not
dripping<00:03:11.160> out<00:03:11.430> all<00:03:11.610> over<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.360> then<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.410> just

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
dripping out all over and then you just

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.080 
dripping out all over and then you just
have<00:03:13.709> two<00:03:13.890> connectors<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.820> connect

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
have two connectors you just connect

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.590 
have two connectors you just connect
them<00:03:15.300> here<00:03:16.250> here<00:03:17.250> big<00:03:17.880> thing<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.420> don't

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
them here here big thing is just don't

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600 
them here here big thing is just don't
force<00:03:18.900> anything<00:03:19.230> upon<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:20.010> connectors<00:03:20.400> are

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
force anything upon the connectors are

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.400 
force anything upon the connectors are
pretty<00:03:21.000> nice

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
pretty nice

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.040 
pretty nice
usually<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.220> push<00:03:23.880> down<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.569> lever<00:03:24.600> that

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
usually just push down on the lever that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.520 
usually just push down on the lever that
lets<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.470> slip<00:03:25.709> stuff<00:03:26.070> apart<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.660> then<00:03:27.810> when

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
lets you slip stuff apart and then when

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.770 
lets you slip stuff apart and then when
you<00:03:28.620> got<00:03:28.770> your<00:03:28.980> distributor<00:03:29.520> out<00:03:35.630> when<00:03:36.630> you're

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
you got your distributor out when you're

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.720 
you got your distributor out when you're
putting<00:03:37.080> one<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.290> these<00:03:37.380> back<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:38.510> this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
putting one of these back in this

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.810 
putting one of these back in this
connector<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.030> offset<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:43.310> more<00:03:44.310> on

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
connector here is offset it's more on

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.009 
connector here is offset it's more on
one<00:03:45.000> side<00:03:45.030> than<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.540> other<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.840> when

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
one side than the other and so when

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.910 
one side than the other and so when
you're<00:03:49.230> hooking<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:50.459> up

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.730 

you<00:03:55.459> want<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.700> make<00:03:55.819> sure<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:57.170> lines<00:03:57.500> up

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
you want to make sure that this lines up

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.180 
you want to make sure that this lines up
it's<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.660> cut<00:03:59.660> inside<00:04:00.050> there<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:00.830> you'll<00:04:01.040> know

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
it's a cut inside there and you'll know

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.680 
it's a cut inside there and you'll know
it<00:04:01.310> should<00:04:01.459> just<00:04:01.580> slide<00:04:01.700> right<00:04:01.880> in<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.510> if<00:04:02.599> you

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
it should just slide right in so if you

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.850 
it should just slide right in so if you
can't<00:04:03.020> slide<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.500> in

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
can't slide it in

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.970 
can't slide it in
then<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.940> need<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.330> probably<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:06.500> rotate

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
then you need to probably just rotate

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.760 
then you need to probably just rotate
this<00:04:07.130> around<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:08.630> line<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.050> up<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.590> can

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
this around to line this up so you can

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.129 
this around to line this up so you can
slide<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.010> in

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.439 

so<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.829> should<00:04:17.009> just<00:04:17.039> pop<00:04:17.789> right<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.269> with

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
so this should just pop right in with

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.159 
so this should just pop right in with
very<00:04:18.659> little<00:04:18.720> effort<00:04:20.150> just<00:04:21.150> forcefully<00:04:22.019> but

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
very little effort just forcefully but

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.890 
very little effort just forcefully but
it<00:04:22.289> shouldn't<00:04:22.830> resist<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:26.780> then<00:04:27.780> you

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
it shouldn't resist you and then you

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.230 
it shouldn't resist you and then you
just<00:04:27.960> put<00:04:28.259> in<00:04:28.379> your<00:04:28.469> three<00:04:28.770> bolts<00:04:29.219> and<00:04:29.430> rehook

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
just put in your three bolts and rehook

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.969 
just put in your three bolts and rehook
up<00:04:30.389> your<00:04:30.599> connectors<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.289> put<00:04:31.860> your

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
up your connectors and put your

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.950 
up your connectors and put your
distributor<00:04:32.520> wires<00:04:32.639> back<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:35.569> okay<00:04:36.569> I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
distributor wires back on okay I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.170 
distributor wires back on okay I
up<00:04:37.080> my<00:04:37.259> connectors<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.280> keep<00:04:38.490> things<00:04:38.729> on<00:04:38.969> this

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
up my connectors to keep things on this

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.420 
up my connectors to keep things on this
is<00:04:39.479> don't<00:04:40.349> force<00:04:40.650> anything<00:04:40.979> you<00:04:41.159> don't<00:04:41.250> want

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
is don't force anything you don't want

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.339 
is don't force anything you don't want
to<00:04:41.460> break<00:04:41.699> these<00:04:41.879> I<00:04:41.939> have<00:04:42.479> no<00:04:42.629> idea<00:04:42.870> what<00:04:43.050> you

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
to break these I have no idea what you

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.580 
to break these I have no idea what you
can<00:04:43.439> even<00:04:43.620> buy<00:04:43.889> these<00:04:43.949> if<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.430> break<00:04:44.639> them<00:04:45.590> but

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
can even buy these if you break them but

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.959 
can even buy these if you break them but
I<00:04:46.650> wouldn't<00:04:46.919> want<00:04:47.099> to<00:04:47.159> have<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.610> go<00:04:47.699> through

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
I wouldn't want to have to go through

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.770 
I wouldn't want to have to go through
that<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:49.080> just<00:04:49.110> be<00:04:49.889> gentle<00:04:50.639> don't<00:04:51.060> force

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
that so just be gentle don't force

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.719 
that so just be gentle don't force
anything<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.229> should<00:04:52.409> go<00:04:52.830> together<00:04:53.099> easily

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
anything it should go together easily

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.110 
anything it should go together easily
I<00:04:54.770> put<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.889> bolts<00:04:56.190> in<00:04:56.310> there's<00:04:56.729> three<00:04:56.940> bolts

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
I put the bolts in there's three bolts

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.689 
I put the bolts in there's three bolts
and<00:04:57.509> I<00:04:58.259> didn't<00:04:58.680> tighten<00:04:58.949> them<00:04:59.190> down<00:04:59.219> really

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
and I didn't tighten them down really

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.399 
and I didn't tighten them down really
tight<00:04:59.969> I<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:00.300> snug<00:05:00.539> them<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.080> wouldn't

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
tight I just snug them so this wouldn't

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.360 
tight I just snug them so this wouldn't
come<00:05:01.740> off<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:03.750> that's<00:05:03.900> because<00:05:04.229> when<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.009> start

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
come off and that's because when I start

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.670 
come off and that's because when I start
this<00:05:05.550> I'm<00:05:05.729> gonna<00:05:05.990> adjust<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.169> by<00:05:07.319> hand<00:05:07.560> a

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
this I'm gonna adjust it by hand a

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.529 
this I'm gonna adjust it by hand a
little<00:05:07.860> bit<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.099> get<00:05:08.219> it<00:05:08.370> within<00:05:08.580> idle<00:05:09.120> so

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
little bit to get it within idle so

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.399 
little bit to get it within idle so
where<00:05:09.659> it<00:05:09.719> sounds<00:05:09.900> good

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
where it sounds good

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.790 
where it sounds good
and<00:05:10.500> then<00:05:10.740> I'll<00:05:10.860> do<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.069> timing<00:05:11.490> on<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:12.800> on

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
and then I'll do the timing on it on

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.529 
and then I'll do the timing on it on
this<00:05:14.009> particular<00:05:14.520> one<00:05:14.610> for<00:05:14.819> whatever<00:05:15.029> reason

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
this particular one for whatever reason

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.809 
this particular one for whatever reason
they<00:05:16.289> usually<00:05:16.409> have<00:05:16.680> an<00:05:16.800> eight<00:05:17.159> with<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.400> circle

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
they usually have an eight with a circle

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.790 
they usually have an eight with a circle
on<00:05:17.969> it<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.689> show<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:18.900> your<00:05:19.110> spark<00:05:19.349> plug<00:05:19.529> number

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
on it to show you your spark plug number

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.339 
on it to show you your spark plug number
one<00:05:20.069> goes<00:05:20.360> but<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.509> one's<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.990> kind<00:05:22.169> of<00:05:22.199> a

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
one goes but this one's that kind of a

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.640 
one goes but this one's that kind of a
apparently<00:05:23.219> a<00:05:23.310> Chinese<00:05:24.560> aftermarket<00:05:25.560> or

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
apparently a Chinese aftermarket or

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.339 
apparently a Chinese aftermarket or
something<00:05:25.979> that<00:05:26.069> doesn't<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:27.259> marking<00:05:28.259> on

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
something that doesn't have a marking on

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.200 
something that doesn't have a marking on
it<00:05:28.379> one<00:05:29.219> way<00:05:29.370> you<00:05:29.430> can<00:05:29.610> tell<00:05:29.819> is<00:05:29.969> there's<00:05:30.150> a

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
it one way you can tell is there's a

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.209 
it one way you can tell is there's a
little<00:05:30.509> circle<00:05:30.690> deal<00:05:30.990> here<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.409> then<00:05:31.949> you<00:05:32.099> got

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
little circle deal here and then you got

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.100 
little circle deal here and then you got
this<00:05:32.339> long<00:05:32.580> beam<00:05:32.849> here<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.719> the<00:05:33.779> one<00:05:33.930> in

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
this long beam here and the one in

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.659 
this long beam here and the one in
between<00:05:34.379> that's<00:05:34.620> gonna<00:05:34.889> be<00:05:35.069> your<00:05:35.190> number<00:05:35.490> one

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
between that's gonna be your number one

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.219 
between that's gonna be your number one
so<00:05:36.240> take<00:05:36.449> your<00:05:36.569> number<00:05:37.349> one<00:05:37.620> spark<00:05:37.949> plug<00:05:38.159> wire

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
so take your number one spark plug wire

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.399 
so take your number one spark plug wire
that<00:05:40.229> should<00:05:40.440> just<00:05:40.620> pop<00:05:40.919> right<00:05:40.979> in<00:05:41.339> there<00:05:42.409> and

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
that should just pop right in there and

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.499 
that should just pop right in there and
then<00:05:43.589> you<00:05:43.710> go<00:05:43.889> on<00:05:44.069> hook<00:05:44.610> up<00:05:44.759> your<00:05:45.120> other<00:05:45.270> ones

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
then you go on hook up your other ones

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.749 
then you go on hook up your other ones
and<00:05:46.020> again<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.589> should<00:05:46.800> go<00:05:48.770> go<00:05:49.770> out<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.159> check<00:05:50.400> I

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
and again it should go go out to check I

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.600 
and again it should go go out to check I
think<00:05:51.120> it<00:05:51.210> goes<00:05:51.360> one<00:05:51.629> four<00:05:52.169> three<00:05:52.529> two

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.540 

this<00:05:55.970> one's<00:05:56.439> too<00:05:57.439> I<00:05:57.470> believe

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.739 

there's<00:06:03.000> three

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:07.749 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.320 

hooking<00:06:08.749> up<00:06:08.870> for<00:06:09.080> here<00:06:10.120> I'm<00:06:11.120> gonna

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
hooking up for here I'm gonna

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.059 
hooking up for here I'm gonna
double-check<00:06:11.749> that<00:06:12.050> I<00:06:12.319> got<00:06:12.620> it<00:06:12.740> written<00:06:12.919> down

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
double-check that I got it written down

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.779 
double-check that I got it written down
inside<00:06:14.770> but<00:06:15.770> it<00:06:15.860> definitely<00:06:15.949> doesn't<00:06:16.310> go<00:06:16.490> 1<00:06:16.639> 2

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
inside but it definitely doesn't go 1 2

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.140 
inside but it definitely doesn't go 1 2
3<00:06:16.819> 4<00:06:17.029> because<00:06:17.719> the<00:06:18.020> firing<00:06:18.379> order<00:06:18.529> this<00:06:18.919> is<00:06:19.849> not

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
3 4 because the firing order this is not

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.619 
3 4 because the firing order this is not
1<00:06:20.449> 2<00:06:20.569> 3<00:06:20.719> 4<00:06:21.080> it's<00:06:21.740> daggered<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:22.789> that's

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
1 2 3 4 it's daggered and that's

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:28.689 
1 2 3 4 it's daggered and that's
controlled<00:06:24.050> by<00:06:24.139> your<00:06:24.349> rotor<00:06:26.949> okay<00:06:27.949> double

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
controlled by your rotor okay double

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:29.980 
controlled by your rotor okay double
check<00:06:28.909> my<00:06:29.120> notes<00:06:29.330> and<00:06:29.539> the<00:06:29.629> cording<00:06:29.840> to<00:06:29.900> my

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
check my notes and the cording to my

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.459 
check my notes and the cording to my
notes<00:06:30.259> it<00:06:30.409> does<00:06:30.620> go<00:06:30.830> 1<00:06:31.069> 3<00:06:31.449> 4<00:06:32.449> and<00:06:32.719> 2<00:06:35.349> okay<00:06:36.349> you're

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:36.469 
notes it does go 1 3 4 and 2 okay you're

00:06:36.469 --> 00:07:02.120 
notes it does go 1 3 4 and 2 okay you're
gonna<00:06:36.560> fire<00:06:37.099> it<00:06:37.219> up<00:06:37.310> see<00:06:37.550> if<00:06:37.610> it<00:06:37.699> works

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.680 

I<00:07:02.160> don't<00:07:02.670> know<00:07:02.730> if<00:07:02.820> I<00:07:02.880> got<00:07:03.030> this<00:07:03.180> loose<00:07:03.420> enough

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
I don't know if I got this loose enough

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:19.040 
I don't know if I got this loose enough
to<00:07:03.720> Jeff<00:07:04.080> but<00:07:04.200> I'm<00:07:04.290> gonna<00:07:04.380> give<00:07:04.590> you<00:07:04.680> a<00:07:04.710> shot

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.200 

that<00:07:19.409> keypad<00:07:20.009> I<00:07:20.039> gotta<00:07:20.280> loosen<00:07:20.460> that<00:07:20.789> up

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.820 

and<00:07:23.630> again<00:07:23.840> it<00:07:23.930> might<00:07:24.110> be<00:07:24.229> a<00:07:24.259> little<00:07:24.380> cold

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.710 

but<00:07:27.340> anyways<00:07:27.640> it<00:07:27.760> really<00:07:27.970> needs<00:07:28.150> to<00:07:28.240> be<00:07:28.300> timed

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
but anyways it really needs to be timed

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.690 
but anyways it really needs to be timed

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.300 
at
also<00:07:31.450> when<00:07:31.630> you<00:07:31.750> start<00:07:32.260> the<00:07:32.530> engine<00:07:32.620> I<00:07:32.950> like<00:07:33.130> to

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310 
also when you start the engine I like to

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.790 
also when you start the engine I like to
turn<00:07:33.790> it<00:07:33.940> into<00:07:34.120> just<00:07:34.660> before<00:07:35.320> you<00:07:35.380> start<00:07:35.680> it

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
turn it into just before you start it

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.860 
turn it into just before you start it
and<00:07:35.890> then<00:07:36.010> all<00:07:36.130> your<00:07:36.310> lights<00:07:36.490> clear<00:07:36.880> out<00:07:37.030> and

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
and then all your lights clear out and

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.570 
and then all your lights clear out and
then<00:07:38.410> tuck<00:07:38.710> them<00:07:38.890> in<00:07:39.070> that<00:07:39.160> way<00:07:39.310> you<00:07:39.370> know<00:07:39.520> you

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
then tuck them in that way you know you

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.460 
then tuck them in that way you know you
gotta<00:07:39.850> get<00:07:40.360> a<00:07:40.390> check<00:07:40.660> engine<00:07:40.870> light<00:07:41.050> or<00:07:41.320> not

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.470 
gotta get a check engine light or not

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.360 
gotta get a check engine light or not
and<00:07:41.980> everything<00:07:42.310> that's<00:07:42.580> me<00:07:42.820> running<00:07:43.180> good
