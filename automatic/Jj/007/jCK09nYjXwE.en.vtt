00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello how are we here in the 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.790
 community garden full earth and today 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.820
 I come to tell you about a bush that 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.480
 I have the chaya family right behind me 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 of the skin girl 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.090
 the chaya also known as chai or 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.119
 Spinach tree comes from the peninsula 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.920
 from Yucatan its scientific name is ni 2 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.350
 cluj are called za 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.940
 the plant is very associated with the 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.160
 Mayan culture since it was used in 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.760
 combination with corn and seeds 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.339
 from ayote to make tamales 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.440
 the shrub reaches up to 6 meters 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.839
 high but it is usually maintained 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.710
 around the two of us let's see a little 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.010
 closer 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.530
 the talk has more potassium and more iron 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.290
 that common spinach to harvest the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.989
 we can harvest up to 60 percent of 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.239
 the leaves in the bush however not 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.510
 It is a good idea to consume more than 5 leaves 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.879
 per day 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.340
 If you see here with me, I have the flower of 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.860
 ax is already not yet finished 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.369
 develop but eventually it will be 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.080
 white so small the blade has a 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.080
 way like with three fingers 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.109
 to consume the chaya is very important 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.009
 cook it since it contains hydroxy acid 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.750
 anikÃ³ is very easy we take the leaves and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.670
 We put them in boiling water for a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.039
 minute and with that we are ready to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.659
 consume them without any problem to the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.289
 harvest time let's be careful 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.719
 Well, some young branches may have 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.329
 like little hairs that can nettles or 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.850
 cause allergies the chaya has 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.509
 diuretic and laxative properties in addition 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.069
 improve circulation and digestion 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.640
 Strengthens the nails and helps during 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.640
 breastfeeding period 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.460
 good and that's all for today we hope 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.010
 this information has been useful 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.750
 on the chaya or spinach tree here 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.170
 we take ours that enjoy it 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.170
 see you later
