00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:00.875
Tell me...

00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:03.125
...do all dead people
turn into stars?

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.708
The ones alive seem to think so...

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:07.250
So, how many of these stars
did we make?

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:08.958
Umm... 11?

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.375
Today's kill would still be enroute?
How far would he have reached?

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.125
I've been shooting guns...

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.250
...since you were not inside your
mother, but inside your father.

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.875
I've put a full 100 grams
of hot lead inside the body.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:42.125
Darling Uncle, why hide behind the menu card, just to peep?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.875
Stare, like there is no tomorrow!

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.667
If it's a lie, you can claim my life

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.625
I'll have it, even before
you can give it.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:59.583
Irrespective of where a child is born, his upbringing defines him.
