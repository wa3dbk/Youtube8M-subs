00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
to Windows 10 first of all one of the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.859 
to Windows 10 first of all one of the
great<00:00:21.480> great<00:00:22.400> things<00:00:23.400> why<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.699> should<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
great great things why it should be the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
great great things why it should be the
case<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.010> move<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.369> Windows<00:00:26.519> 10<00:00:26.760> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
case that you move to Windows 10 is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.169 
case that you move to Windows 10 is
because<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.330> free<00:00:27.769> that<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.179> really

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because it's free that is really

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.669 
because it's free that is really
something<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.470> really

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
long as you want why should you go to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.580 
long as you want why should you go to
Windows<00:01:22.409> 10<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.390> versions<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.200> an

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Windows 10 well like all versions of an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.630 
Windows 10 well like all versions of an
operating<00:01:26.009> system<00:01:26.159> there<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.810> improvements

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
operating system there are improvements

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.480 
operating system there are improvements
one<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> main<00:01:30.090> reasons<00:01:30.860> security<00:01:31.860> Windows

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
one of the main reasons security Windows

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.840 
one of the main reasons security Windows
10<00:01:32.759> once<00:01:33.750> again<00:01:34.079> has<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.770> security<00:01:35.280> options

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
10 once again has more security options

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.100 
10 once again has more security options
it's<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:37.290> secure<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> Windows<00:01:38.729> 8<00:01:39.110> then

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it's more secure and Windows 8 then

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.550 
it's more secure and Windows 8 then
Windows<00:01:40.380> 7<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.280> Windows<00:01:41.610> XP<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
Windows 7 then Windows XP you know the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830 
Windows 7 then Windows XP you know the
people<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.460> stay<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:45.060> old<00:01:45.119> versions

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
people that stay in very old versions

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.210 
people that stay in very old versions
like<00:01:45.990> those<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.380> still<00:01:46.530> using<00:01:46.890> Windows<00:01:46.920> XP

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
like those are still using Windows XP

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
like those are still using Windows XP
don't<00:01:47.549> understand<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.299> key<00:01:48.659> thing<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
don't understand one key thing about the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.899 
don't understand one key thing about the
operating<00:01:50.130> system<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.420> security

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
operating system is that security

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.109 
operating system is that security
evolves<00:01:53.909> security<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.649> gets<00:01:56.009> better<00:01:56.909> with

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
evolves security really gets better with

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.020 
evolves security really gets better with
time<00:01:57.450> why<00:01:57.810> because<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.040> security<00:01:59.430> needs<00:01:59.880> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
time why because the security needs of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
time why because the security needs of
an<00:02:00.119> operating<00:02:00.509> system<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.960> 2015<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
an operating system in 2015 are not the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.660 
an operating system in 2015 are not the
same<00:02:03.390> ones<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.430> were<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.700> 20<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.259> in

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
same ones that were in 20 you know in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.350 
same ones that were in 20 you know in
2005<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:09.560> 2004<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.160> more<00:02:11.340> bad<00:02:11.520> guys<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
2005 or 2004 and more bad guys more and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.910 
2005 or 2004 and more bad guys more and
more

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
more

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.250 
more
bad<00:02:13.550> things<00:02:13.940> out<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.960> need<00:02:15.080> an

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
bad things out there so you need an

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.050 
bad things out there so you need an
operating<00:02:15.560> system<00:02:15.800> that's<00:02:16.010> more<00:02:16.490> secure<00:02:16.910> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
operating system that's more secure and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.630 
operating system that's more secure and
when<00:02:17.209> those<00:02:17.300> ten<00:02:17.569> does<00:02:17.780> offer<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
when those ten does offer that and the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.780 
when those ten does offer that and the
way<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> works<00:02:20.480> also<00:02:21.400> 64-bit<00:02:22.400> operating

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
way that it works also 64-bit operating

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.860 
way that it works also 64-bit operating
systems<00:02:23.240> are<00:02:23.450> more<00:02:24.440> secure<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.100> general<00:02:25.580> also

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
systems are more secure in general also

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.810 
systems are more secure in general also
that's<00:02:26.870> another<00:02:27.110> reason<00:02:29.170> also<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.880> know<00:02:33.820> new

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
that's another reason also you know new

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.790 
that's another reason also you know new
Windows<00:02:35.420> versions<00:02:35.959> come<00:02:36.320> with<00:02:36.530> some

Windows versions come with some

Windows versions come with some

I<00:02:48.560> understand<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.280> people<00:02:49.520> get<00:02:49.700> scared<00:02:49.970> of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
I understand that people get scared of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.820 
I understand that people get scared of
upgrading<00:02:50.600> because<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:50.989> went<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.560> Windows

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
upgrading because they went to Windows

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
upgrading because they went to Windows
8.1<00:02:52.040> or<00:02:52.430> Windows<00:02:52.640> 8<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:54.580> changed<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
8.1 or Windows 8 and it's changed the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.740 
8.1 or Windows 8 and it's changed the
way<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.750> they<00:02:57.350> actually<00:02:57.560> use<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> computer<00:02:58.750> so

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
way that they actually use a computer so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.900 
way that they actually use a computer so
people<00:03:00.260> get<00:03:00.650> scared<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.160> little<00:03:01.280> bit<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.640> you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
people get scared a little bit of you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.490 
people get scared a little bit of you
know<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.180> upgrade<00:03:02.570> process<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.200> one<00:03:03.320> thing

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
know the upgrade process but one thing

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.990 
know the upgrade process but one thing
for<00:03:03.650> sure<00:03:03.850> Windows<00:03:04.850> 10<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:05.989> improves<00:03:06.620> upon

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
for sure Windows 10 really improves upon

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.180 
for sure Windows 10 really improves upon
the<00:03:08.000> usability<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.900> your<00:03:08.989> operating<00:03:09.800> system

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the usability of your operating system

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.050 
the usability of your operating system
and<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.519> your<00:03:10.760> computer<00:03:12.370> if<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.670> are<00:03:13.880> on

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
and of your computer if you are on

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.880 
and of your computer if you are on
Windows<00:03:14.330> 8.1<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:15.080> think<00:03:15.560> pretty<00:03:15.800> much

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
Windows 8.1 I think pretty much

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.770 
Windows 8.1 I think pretty much
everybody<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.459> Windows<00:03:16.790> 8.1<00:03:16.940> needs<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.600> go<00:03:17.720> to

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
everybody on Windows 8.1 needs to go to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.699 
everybody on Windows 8.1 needs to go to
Windows<00:03:18.140> 10<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.590> think<00:03:19.220> that's<00:03:20.470> something<00:03:21.470> that

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
Windows 10 I think that's something that

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.180 
Windows 10 I think that's something that
I<00:03:21.950> am<00:03:22.459> really<00:03:23.150> really<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:24.500> know<00:03:24.530> convinced

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
I am really really you know convinced

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.180 
I am really really you know convinced
that<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.700> should<00:03:25.910> do<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.950> but<00:03:27.950> there's<00:03:28.130> a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
that you should do so but there's a

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.060 
that you should do so but there's a
little<00:03:28.700> thing<00:03:29.180> here<00:03:29.620> remember<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.739> Windows

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
little thing here remember that Windows

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.729 
little thing here remember that Windows
10<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.579> an<00:03:32.000> evolving<00:03:32.600> operating<00:03:33.230> system<00:03:33.560> that

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
10 is an evolving operating system that

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.030 
10 is an evolving operating system that
means<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.430> your<00:03:34.790> Windows<00:03:35.150> 10<00:03:35.590> will<00:03:36.590> have

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
means that your Windows 10 will have

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.280 
means that your Windows 10 will have
constant<00:03:38.500> upgrades<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.940> will<00:03:41.390> be<00:03:41.600> improved

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
constant upgrades it will be improved

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.990 
constant upgrades it will be improved
with<00:03:42.769> time<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:45.010> maybe<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.310> don't<00:03:46.519> need<00:03:46.790> it

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
with time so maybe you don't need it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.500 
with time so maybe you don't need it
right<00:03:47.360> away<00:03:47.600> July<00:03:48.350> 29th<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.459> would<00:03:50.329> be<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
right away July 29th and that would be a

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.699 
right away July 29th and that would be a
safe<00:03:50.900> thing<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.739> do<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:54.350> wait<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.560> get<00:03:57.560> it

got a year you don't have to rush things
and<00:04:12.019> that's<00:04:12.230> something<00:04:12.890> that's<00:04:13.070> important<00:04:13.970> to

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
and that's something that's important to

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.940

do and that is also something that I
think<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.579> better

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.600 

the<00:04:26.880> reasons<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.090> upgrade<00:04:28.120> also<00:04:28.930> go<00:04:29.530> with<00:04:29.980> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
the reasons to upgrade also go with you

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.770 
the reasons to upgrade also go with you
know<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.880> fact<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.390> operating<00:04:31.720> system

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
know the fact that the operating system

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.340 
know the fact that the operating system
has<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:33.190> number<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.790> improvements<00:04:34.450> on<00:04:34.540> speed<00:04:35.050> as

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
has a number of improvements on speed as

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.700 
has a number of improvements on speed as
new<00:04:36.040> features<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.520> direct<00:04:37.210> x12<00:04:37.600> for<00:04:38.230> gamers

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
new features like direct x12 for gamers

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.070 
new features like direct x12 for gamers
so<00:04:39.670> there's<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.910> lot<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.180> things<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.960> know

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
so there's a lot of things that you know

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.230 
so there's a lot of things that you know
push<00:04:41.440> Windows<00:04:41.860> 10<00:04:42.040> into<00:04:42.430> something<00:04:43.060> positive

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
push Windows 10 into something positive

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.230 
push Windows 10 into something positive
something<00:04:43.750> that's<00:04:44.080> pretty<00:04:44.440> cool<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.860> use<00:04:45.100> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.880 

you<00:04:49.240> know<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.390> think<00:04:49.540> if<00:04:49.840> Microsoft<00:04:50.320> does<00:04:50.650> it

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
you know I think if Microsoft does it

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.910 
you know I think if Microsoft does it
too<00:04:51.010> right<00:04:51.540> that's<00:04:52.540> one<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.080> main<00:04:53.320> reasons

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
too right that's one of the main reasons

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.150 
too right that's one of the main reasons
why<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.700> should<00:04:54.970> upgrade<00:04:55.830> also<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.920> fact

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
why you should upgrade also the fact

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.980 
why you should upgrade also the fact
that<00:04:57.220> Windows<00:04:57.610> 10<00:04:57.790> is<00:04:58.030> an<00:04:58.240> operating<00:04:58.600> system

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
that Windows 10 is an operating system

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.880 
that Windows 10 is an operating system
that<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.200> now<00:04:59.590> kind<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.250> 1<00:05:01.000> operating

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
that is now kind of a 1 operating

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.190 
that is now kind of a 1 operating
operating<00:05:02.890> system<00:05:03.490> for<00:05:03.730> everything<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:05.050> know

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
operating system for everything you know

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.150 
operating system for everything you know
Universal<00:05:05.860> apps<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:07.660> improved<00:05:08.380> Windows

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
Universal apps the improved Windows

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.060 
Universal apps the improved Windows
Store<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.970> another<00:05:10.330> reason<00:05:10.750> there's<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.440> lot<00:05:11.890> of

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
Store is another reason there's a lot of

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.740 
Store is another reason there's a lot of
stuff<00:05:12.430> in<00:05:12.580> Windows<00:05:12.910> 10<00:05:13.090> that's<00:05:13.330> very

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
stuff in Windows 10 that's very

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.460 
stuff in Windows 10 that's very
interesting<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:15.250> think<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.630> worth

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
interesting and I think that is worth

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.980 
interesting and I think that is worth
the<00:05:18.100> upgrade<00:05:18.130> I<00:05:18.670> think<00:05:19.090> it's<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.480> good<00:05:19.630> idea

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
the upgrade I think it's a good idea

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.790 
the upgrade I think it's a good idea
especially<00:05:20.650> if<00:05:21.190> you're<00:05:21.340> on<00:05:21.460> Windows<00:05:21.760> 8.1<00:05:24.240> so

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
especially if you're on Windows 8.1 so

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.500 
especially if you're on Windows 8.1 so
what<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:27.280> know<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.880> should<00:05:28.120> do<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.480> just

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
what you know you should do is just

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.810 
what you know you should do is just
check<00:05:29.140> that<00:05:29.290> out<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.770> don't<00:05:30.190> rush<00:05:30.520> anything

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
check that out and don't rush anything

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.330 
check that out and don't rush anything
you<00:05:31.720> don't<00:05:31.840> have<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.170> get<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.470> on<00:05:32.590> July<00:05:32.860> 29th
