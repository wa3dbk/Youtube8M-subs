00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.960
 many people ask how it is fixed as 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.639
 two posts are attached 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:15.630
 if they are against each other now i'm 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:27.510
 This will quickly show so unscrew 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 top tube 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.739
 Chip but I think everything is clear from the side 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 two screws included so now now 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.059
 This is a column, see what I'm doing just 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.180
 turning him off often becomes everything 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180
 understandably 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:59.600
 means with the bottom of the included 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.809
 confirmat and screw in the hole knowingly 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.410
 less less than less diameter to 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.850
 he did not unscrew if you see the following 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.850
 left from the pipe 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.060
 the lower tube is attached simply by 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.330
 screw 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.869
 not centered but two can be used 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.630
 so that it was stronger about the pipe 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.720
 she 's on top 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:34.270
 that the bottom is the same and that's it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:39.110
 way uncomfortable here I dressed obviously 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.880
 drilled hole in one 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.080
 one hand is not convenient to wind and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.080
 just cheat 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.400
 so everything is firmly holding back now 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.540
 all back here so here is attached 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.990
 many more ask about the size 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:14.450
 sizes of the house and whether it will turn month 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.450
 you quickly show but try 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.940
 it means the house consists of a roof of two 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.870
 the same 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.890
 workpiece tops front 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.400
 back and two identical sides 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:40.380
 mean first part 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:44.450
 110 but 372 2 180 by 372 these two parts 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.450
 same sidewall 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:54.799
 2 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:04.170
 don't see 200 by 300 back 300 on 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:09.420
 350 means 300 to 350 and has 2 2 chamfers 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:15.720
 or two slant size 120 on the table so I 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.670
 I think this is understandable so the front part 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.370
 the same as busy is just different 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.500
 slot 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.620
 I repeat 300 for 350 is its size 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.769
 cutout is dimensioned to center 120 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.489
 distance diameter of a circle or 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.390
 slotted 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.390
 190 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 but what else at the base is 500 by 500 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:04:01.050
 both the first base and the second 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:04:03.120
 bar 150 by 500 on the size of the column is not 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.790
 pay attention do not match 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.050
 what kind of pipe was really 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.910
 a grid used well, that's all I 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.840
 I think everyone understands what and how 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.840
 if anything write
