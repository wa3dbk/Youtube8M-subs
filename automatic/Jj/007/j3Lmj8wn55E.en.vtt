00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.490
 so again from the kamelia business tour 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.139
 2013 from hamburger airport again too 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.219
 hospitable at heiko on the password-standing 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.020
 heiko what 's new 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.510
 Now we are here before ours 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.120
 de dx compared to the dn lynxes 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.560
 no integrated navigation after 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.820
 as before as the devices through the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.070
 Bank the possibility over the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.810
 so called app not a garmin 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.490
 to use navigation app on the iphone 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.990
 and to show the control is done 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.850
 then just about the iphone but the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.160
 Presentation of the card then gives it up 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 the dtx what's new this year 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.800
 all devices with bluetooth 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.530
 are equipped so except for the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.940
 smallest dx offer the possibility that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.460
 I have an extra black box 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.090
 connect to mirror link devices 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.829
 to join 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.930
 that means various Nokia phones are to 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.450
 able and very well known 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.280
 For example, Samsung Galaxy S3 had the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.660
 I then completely about this car radio 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.910
 can control and I can for example 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.470
 also the navigation application app of the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.450
 so devices like maps in the case of 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.100
 nokia or next to the google maps 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.439
 Application on the Samsung devices 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.909
 represent and also control that 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.679
 whole then really very hot about 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.969
 a digital image connection is 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.109
 of course a real advantage because of me 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.999
 then my radio can control 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.619
 about it and then I'm really complete 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.909
 the devices are connected with the mobile phone okay 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.829
 are probably much cheaper 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.049
 how the devices are right in when so there 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.139
 then it starts at 299 for the device 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.429
 without integrated bluetooth handsfree 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:24.999
 Handsfree at 349 we have 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.240
 then the bluetooth handsfree 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.319
 in the 349 device there are also 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.319
 another difference in design 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.539
 simple so we have 40 23 pc as well 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.069
 what was usual with the dial on 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.979
 the left side what now this year 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.990
 new is the dx 42 bt with a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.389
 volume rocker and what in my eyes 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.979
 very good jump was made is that 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.840
 we now have the usb connection with these 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.249
 dtx also on the back have something 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.469
 of course a bit of installation effort 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.130
 because i have this usb cable 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.990
 For example, put in the glove box 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.369
 But it can be clear 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.609
 nicer solution than if I have someone 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.719
 usb stick stuck in the front of the device 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.819
 okay, what else is new 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.469
 what is new as all 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.599
 Of course devices have an ipod iphone 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.079
 control 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.669
 bluetooth hands-free as well 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.170
 that are used to the thickest 

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:08.770
 on the smallest stage of development too 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.110
 available 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.910
 So here too multimedia really 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.020
 Great style is only difference 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.000
 just that the navigation is not 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.410
 integrated is okay from when may the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.970
 Customers are looking forward to the products 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.890
 they are already starting so you can 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.430
 you buy everything already clear of the beautiful in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430
 Thank you thank you
