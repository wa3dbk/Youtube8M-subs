00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.430
 hi to all the boys and girls then 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.080
 Today this morning I got up 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.299
 soon and I went to the lidl because me 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 some things were needed for the pillow and 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.210
 I bought the like the other time 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.380
 this is a package that was this one 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.750
 which are 96 accessory pieces always for 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.050
 the sewing that I already opened because not 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.509
 I was looking forward to where inside 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.920
 I found these things but it's not the first 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.530
 I had already taken it the last time 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.370
 in fact then I'll explain why I have it 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.720
 taken 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.160
 I have taken up why they were also needed 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.440
 other pins and that's fine but 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.630
 basically for one thing then 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.210
 inside the package we have this 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.680
 small lens with the words sun cut 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.750
 these are a little tool you need for 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.950
 cut the buttonholes or to remove the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.720
 threads to unpick and it is fabulous then there 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.660
 are three packs of needles one for the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.119
 a universal sewing machine that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.830
 which is used to sew jeans and the one for 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.420
 jazz 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.310
 these are hackers are important 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.190
 in itself because you know short of the coach e 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.110
 it often breaks and therefore is convenient 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.840
 so we see that they did 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.880
 see there are in the packaging of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.890
 very nice bows I don't know if you can 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.640
 see these years have over that the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.380
 1 crown up top slit now me 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.370
 I do n't think we can see with the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.300
 my car the voice 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.240
 yes my camera learning the se 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.040
 you can't fit them in the little hole 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.450
 therefore from the crown you can rest 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.640
 over the wire and pushing it over comes 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.719
 inserted into the crown by a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.880
 cut that they have superior 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.369
 exceptional as the exceptional the fact 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.749
 that they also have a filago which in any case 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.579
 if you really don't want to slip in with 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:58.179
 one if not that is another kind of 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.780
 you shove needles plus we 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.689
 this series of pins that are 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.520
 really very comfortable I want put 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.170
 the others I removed from the disk and the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 committed on my pincushion that I have 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.620
 showed the chalk last time 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.030
 to write about fabrics 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.549
 the only thing here is that I don't like it 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.980
 the of such because in any case I do not know if 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:28.060
 in germany we say these of toney 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.720
 huge because I ca n't find them anyway 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.079
 all huge but the most important thing 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.209
 they are the scissors because I with these 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.060
 scissors also charm another ball 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.200
 as always from them it manages to cut the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.640
 I left these scissors here 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.310
 they can then cut the fabric 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.290
 always buy the package today 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.010
 instead this bigger one is one 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.849
 plastic box with two floors in two 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.980
 shelves now mediapro where inside 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:09.130
 you will find everything you need 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.880
 because there are by-wire fuses already 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.049
 insert there are those wires 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.510
 transparent in black and white nylon 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.989
 which are very important other series of 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.419
 the same wires with the relative fuses 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.239
 I slipped on and one of such huge ohs how 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.590
 as usual to all the ways both 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.650
 normal needles that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.140
 the needles those for the let's say 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.879
 verified the greatest and now you will understand 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.349
 because when I show you the part 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.720
 below 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:47.500
 There is always this equipment you need 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:56.239
 orally sew or make cut classrooms 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:59.840
 two strands of elastic bands that are 2 mm thick 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.230
 thickness 8 mm in height and it seems to me that 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.349
 they are two meters an age 61 and from eight of 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.540
 height and are two meters each from 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.630
 thread and then there are these spools 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.599
 black and white black and white by removing the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.150
 top of the box we have 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:23.500
 this part below 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.500
 then the most important thing more 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.510
 the shear is fundamental 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.860
 now I'll let you know why then me 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.350
 I told him I have a difficulty 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.070
 hallucinating to cut the fabric in fact 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.070
 I bought the 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.860
 which is called the washer to be able to 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.460
 cut today I'm going to buy this 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.800
 this set 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.800
 I take these scissors look 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.740
 never happened to take a pair 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.100
 of scissors hold them with the handle 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.730
 from left and right and to be able to cut 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.170
 the fabric look, that is, it looks like one 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.540
 what to those texts sounds like a thing 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.280
 stupid you can't understand what 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.830
 means for a left-handed person to take the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.970
 scissors and cut without having to put them 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.950
 upside down or doing strange 3 strange things 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.590
 so I only tell you this so who is 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.270
 left-handed has problems to cut 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.000
 scissors that you find in the packaging of 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.800
 these here from the lidl are exceptional 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.590
 both the small one I made 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:37.760
 see before that the same for me is 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.760
 exceptional that cuts therefore 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.900
 alive the lidl for the scissors and only 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.460
 for the scissors and I would have already given up 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.850
 money of everything I bought 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.890
 anyway we continue in the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.140
 below are these wires 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.690
 which are used to mend therefore they are 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.940
 a kind of wool thread that anyway 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.620
 serves to remind you of sweaters or things 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.440
 in short, gloves if you have those things 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.000
 in winter they wear out and it is always 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.020
 difficult to find the thread to be able to 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.030
 remember instead they thought 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.670
 good to put the white gray blue 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:18.270
 red ocher and black and to this 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.190
 instead it was the cm but the other one 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.160
 I already had it here for cable 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.930
 wrong the scissors, and yet and the other 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.060
 pack that I showed you 3 then 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:34.170
 there are safety pins and rubber bands 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.630
 the elastic a pack of pins with 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.120
 much of concas leather this thread of 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:45.240
 black and white cotton always for darning 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.950
 and there are these the stress you need both 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.150
 to the male and a female we say that 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:54.390
 what it takes to be able 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:58.920
 join them together as a tailor's centimeter 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.920
 and the chalk pencil 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.700
 and then what else 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.670
 to these he did some things I say not 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:15.670
 I know the beginning is this and these here 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.750
 that I have no idea how 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.510
 working 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.570
 be that this one anyway but here 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:26.800
 I don't know what they are for then I will inform 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.970
 here now from my closet since 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.130
 my niche 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.990
 I greet you and in short I hope to be there 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:36.550
 was useful for this purchase that is 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:39.220
 really for me it was one thing 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.690
 in short phenomenal more than anything else the 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.010
 scissors meal 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.010
 hello to all boys and girls
