black comes in a few other colors as
well<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:10.049> apple<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
well at apple so it's going to get a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.890 
well at apple so it's going to get a
closer<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> inside

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
closer look here so you're on the inside

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
closer look here so you're on the inside
as<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.799> various<00:01:14.159> suede

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
as you see we have various suede

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
as you see we have various suede
material<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.869> definitely<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
material so it's definitely not going to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.770 
material so it's definitely not going to
scratch<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.220> back<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.759> iphone<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.600> is

nice little plus they're just say iphone
then<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.180> has<00:01:21.330> some<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.689> instructions<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
then it has some more instructions that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.630
