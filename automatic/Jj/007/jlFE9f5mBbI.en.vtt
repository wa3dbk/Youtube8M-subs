00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.509

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.880
 to follow two more and then it will end 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.429
 series so well this is the series and 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.129
 this is the extreme right chapter 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.269

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.379
 how are you seeing we have these two 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.350
 players I'm going to put together a template 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.690
 silver to each of the players but 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.390
 before let's see the studs of each one 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.409
 here we are looking at the existing one with 95 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.080
 of 96 rhythm of shot 89 of pass 98 of 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.690
 dribble and 80 of physique that would come to be 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.820
 the most important thing about this player and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 well let's see here to robben 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 we have a robben with 98 of pace 95 of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 90 shot pass 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.350
 98 dribble and 72 good physical I'm going to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 put together a template of each of these 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.960
 players one silver 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.850
 and the other one also or they are going to see here 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.940
 how am I going to assemble the templates for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.160
 then see the performance of each player 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.450
 and so they are going to make the templates here 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.210
 how are we seeing 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.100
 we have alexis sanchez the others 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.830
 Silver players so you can stand out 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.170
 this player and well let's see how the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.940
 which in the match with this player and what 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.640
 I'm going to show you a couple of images and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.540
 a pair of goals if I manage to make a goal 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.540
 with this player 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 Y 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.290
 good and on this side we have the lord 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.030
 roberto tea there we have it there what 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.700
 we are seeing all the players are 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 of silver except him so good we go 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.079
 to see how it was in the game and how it is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.500
 his performance after having seen the 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.500
 alexis sanchez 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.079
 and coming to the conclusion of the 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:31.760
 scores for me robben would take 9.8 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:34.159
 points and alexis 9.7 because I give this 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.439
 duel to robben because robben I think I 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.709
 works better has got more goals 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:42.920
 that alexis in terms of dribbling are very 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.750
 very identical looks so good to me 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.329
 has worked better robben in this case 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.459
 is a matter of luck or is it a matter of 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.099
 to play a game and it depends on the 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.139
 game that we play as we go with 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.760
 each player is not true so this 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.069
 is my opinion I hope you liked the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.440
 video I hope that when deciding 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.420

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.629

 otis otis and players simple letter 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.310
 normal are more or less similar 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.709
 tops and toti because good are more or less 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.689
 the same appearance and the same styles 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.729
 of each player's game so good 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.150
