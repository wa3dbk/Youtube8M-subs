00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so what I'm going to do now is divided

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.330 
so what I'm going to do now is divided
this<00:02:02.540> section<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:03.020> half<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.920> way<00:02:04.010> I<00:02:04.040> can

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
this section in half so that way I can

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.940 
this section in half so that way I can
do<00:02:04.550> my<00:02:04.760> head<00:02:05.000> headband<00:02:05.480> later<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.650> what<00:02:06.890> I'm

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
do my head headband later so what I'm

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.650 
do my head headband later so what I'm
going<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.100> do<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.610> apply<00:02:08.060> equal<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
going to do now is just apply equal to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.480 
going to do now is just apply equal to
this<00:02:08.869> section<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.560> I'm<00:02:09.710> not<00:02:10.100> going<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> be

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
this section that I'm not going to be

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:25.000 
this section that I'm not going to be
using<00:02:10.670> for<00:02:10.820> my<00:02:11.060> headband<00:02:23.650> now<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.830> both

using for my headband now that both

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.920 
using for my headband now that both
sides<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.460> my<00:02:25.580> hair<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.970> done<00:02:26.210> for<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.570> portion

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
i'm not using for the headband i'm going

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.699 
i'm not using for the headband i'm going
to<00:02:28.610> start<00:02:28.880> by<00:02:29.150> dividing<00:02:29.420> my<00:02:29.840> bangs<00:02:30.080> apart<00:02:30.470> from

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
to start by dividing my bangs apart from

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.560 
to start by dividing my bangs apart from
the<00:02:30.860> big<00:02:31.040> main<00:02:31.280> section<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.880> i<00:02:31.940> still<00:02:32.240> have

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the big main section and i still have

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:52.300 
the big main section and i still have
left

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.650 

so<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:53.430> i'm<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.120> divide<00:02:54.390> this

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
so now i'm just going to divide this

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.320 
so now i'm just going to divide this
bang<00:02:54.930> section<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.620> half<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.460> with<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> other

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
bang section in half and with the other

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.360 
bang section in half and with the other
half<00:02:57.660> i'm<00:02:57.960> going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> actually<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.980> ahead<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
half i'm going to actually go ahead and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.330 
half i'm going to actually go ahead and
twist<00:03:00.000> now<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> only<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.530> detangler<00:03:02.040> left

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
twist now I only have the detangler left

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.100 
twist now I only have the detangler left
on<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.880> didn't<00:03:03.120> want<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.300> apply<00:03:03.570> any<00:03:03.840> gel

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
on this I didn't want to apply any gel

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.620 
on this I didn't want to apply any gel
because<00:03:04.320> then<00:03:04.740> it'll<00:03:05.400> stay<00:03:05.730> small<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.240> thin

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
because then it'll stay small and thin

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.290 
because then it'll stay small and thin
and<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.500> wouldn't<00:03:07.890> really<00:03:07.980> know<00:03:08.460> plus<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:09.090> or

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
and it wouldn't really know plus up or

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.480 
and it wouldn't really know plus up or
have<00:03:09.420> any<00:03:09.630> volume<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:10.890> now<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.250> I'm<00:03:11.340> done

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
have any volume and so now that I'm done

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.010 
have any volume and so now that I'm done
