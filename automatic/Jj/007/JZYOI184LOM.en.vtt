00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
they fall off easily i mean the magnetic

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.199 
they fall off easily i mean the magnetic
the<00:03:08.110> magnet<00:03:08.530> ring<00:03:08.860> isn't<00:03:09.040> too<00:03:09.310> strong<00:03:09.640> so

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
the magnet ring isn't too strong so

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.759 
the magnet ring isn't too strong so
they'll<00:03:10.390> fall<00:03:10.630> off<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.080> i<00:03:11.230> just<00:03:11.380> fell<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> lot
