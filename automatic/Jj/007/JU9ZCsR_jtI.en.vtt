 I do not know him 2005 was the best white wine at the same time 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.640
 the best rookie nation in the world 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 but if if for the moment 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.359
 goals we do not know a return to normal the course without hindering the 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.300
 consortium 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.850
 generations mm the pub work in France m hamid grine

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.499
 how in studying they are 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.229
 leading the group of 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:50.180
 Guéant 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.130
 on this upward slope is the difference 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.790
 but shh I found of parliament are it seems together this page 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.030
 m 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.130
 managing their small size 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.430
 the echoes of the points 35 hectares stone 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.350
 I want for this same source c this guy 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 but not forever the rating 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.670
 we have 60 I'm happy this season 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.950
 7% of 112 pages 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.900
 his name 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.130
 collectively we characterize this 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 and yet the agreement so yesterday includes the father 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.100
 master 6 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 so only once a civil 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.750
 according to tehran treatment 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.120
 a sculpture 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.400
 and so I was hoping then 6 the second 12bis 2 2nd minute on the spot the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.250
 peasantry 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.570
 m from there 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.450
 for he is right now 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.090
 I am 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 as long as it lasts diamond elysée 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.540
 to balance 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.890
 bearer of the stern watch she 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.090
 and then 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.920
 sport 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.609
 exactly 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:12.849
 the contract will not focus on health up this point 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.459
 the chosen one 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.449
 we can clearly withdraw 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 I like it so much 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.099
 the purpose of this set start crisis in vain 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.510
 if you are on site 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.849
 Why 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.469
 actually what he wants which is very little 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.469
 culture a color 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.629
 it is necessary 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.230
 that's why I think we'll be able to enjoy a simple menu two hundred 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.739
 four corners of the world why 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.099
 so far 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.019
 and we will taste at 1'80 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.799
 no maybe to put in production ie because I know that I 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.290
 I'm embarking of paper no directory m which is obviously not pleased it is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.319
 very very very long 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.500
 do not trust to stop the decline 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.459
 few hours but if its president so it's true that 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.539
 the time is at a point that all the big and professional 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:07.559
 how do all insiders also know for the general public 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.229
 has known him for quite precisely thanks to sonia alone in this title of best 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.949
 player of the world 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.829
 so why this gap 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.549
