00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello there continuing our course 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.420
 how to make handicrafts with hunting luggage 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 seed and leaves today we add 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 This one has sheets that were not in the videos. 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 previous 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.740
 That's right, and today's theme is like 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.650
 make a christmas tree with leaves 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 Look how nice you can do. 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.069
 your house with great taste can 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.819
 Giving friends anyway is so easy. 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:42.300
 do and the cost is very low 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:45.420
 you will need to make a cone of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.469
 35 centimeters and a glue gun 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 hot 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.129
 the hot glue 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:59.399
 a golden or metallic spray tube 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.250
 sheets and a holder that has to be 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.379
 a little larger than the base 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.430
 from the coni that we are going to put there 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.240
 connected it to the end and this sheet here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.180
 I'll use it is the araticum leaf 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 but it may be another you think is better 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 right as long as the sheet is not very 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.520
 and has a good consistency 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 I really like this sheet because it gives 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:36.539
 a good finish it will show thick 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.759
 and looks just how interesting it is here 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.509
 As things go decaying 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 nature any of them go all 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.950
 thus taking differentiated shades 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.310
 they're getting yellow from yellow we're going 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.200
 passing the orange the rust that until 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270
 stay black right? 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.810
 only when you remove them from the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.209
 nature to the process of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.479
 which was also collected 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.599
 was still green looks she continues 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.910
 so it will not change the color and this 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.280
 from here it has already been withdrawn with a little 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.530
 more time was more composed but 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.060
 It's a very beautiful leaf because around 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.690
 her 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.690
 makes a very beautiful brown frieze 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.319
 especially for this type of work 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.080
 we going to do now then cut the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.840
 leaves at the top by taking out 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.690
 Because it's because we're going to have to queue. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.750
 hot here in peace at the back of 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.430
 sheet and we will paste it in styrofoam 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.980
 Look, here we are putting a 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.049
 side of the other and we measure here she has 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.640
 we finish here we will not cut 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.900
 here she has to have this finish 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.920
 here then people here Styrofoam is well on 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.849
 you 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.880
 We will paste and it will be left so it is 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.910
 these go here look here but this here 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.299
 then to the end with smaller sheets 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.540
 You cut here too and leave some 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.660
 Where I left, stay here, put it there. 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.489
 into this part here and here to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.299
 As you go up the tower 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.519
 You put the sheets in this 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.680
 Here we go, here we are. 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.799
 here in the third row 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.560
 we already filled with is with this queue 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.450
 here it looks like they had gone there we 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.930
 then we put here so 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.170
 successively looks just forming the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.960
 until you get to the top when 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.430
 get there at the top we need 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.940
 is to also put a pain up here 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.630
 right at the end of it, and nature has 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:59.000
 several models I left to adone rest 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.940
 you choose one that has this one 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.920
 a little higher to cover these the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.450
 here you see it is that I cut a 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.510
 piece of leaf 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.910
 I already finished the finish and he 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.660
 will give me the final finish here 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.460
 this one here is a very pretty flower 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.190
 He looks like a lot of string 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.170
 francisco a brown acorn full of 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.510
 mouths mouths here he has 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.790
 pretty seed really nervous 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:33.230
 Look here so here we already fit 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.930
 he was here right and then have done 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.020
 little hat points now we 're going 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.800
 blame the bag down here and let's go 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.570
 also glue on top of the base we 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.930
 we have prepared beforehand that it is a 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.740
 I play with the base a little bit bigger 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.770
 As I said we'll stick it. 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 on here 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.970
 Look, there, we're with them. 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.949
 finished 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.000
 we already did and finish it already 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.340
 we put this top tower part 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.419
 zinho nÃ© and here we already put the base 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.169
 also 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.590
 Okay, so the keirin is more airy. 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.849
 christmas 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.909
 put some golden glitter on it 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.280
 here too there is a little excess 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.080
 of glitter each so much that 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.620
 You want but you can spend a little bit 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.300
 of glue is here in the accounts put the 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.110
 milk is only at the tips 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.349
 here we mix water glue and glitter 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.780
 Neither, and we just took a shower from here. 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.659
 in it there it goes dripping it goes falling 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.650
 but you can also take the excess with 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:51.009
 a brush a fine brush you can 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.110
 take the excess and if from here I put 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.840
 that we have here another one 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.080
 type of finish and thorn 5 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.349
 I put it here and put some strings 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.380
 also has gold in the 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:10.030
 Pinheirinho became very nice beautiful 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:13.630
 right and that here the principle is the same 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.020
 the base here also I used another one 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:22.600
 another element to finish putting 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:26.320
 a star is metallic, do not hurry 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.560
 something metal is like that and it's 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.960
 that choice I filled out and 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.380
 with paprika and the good ones that stayed 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.800
 fills in with this margenzinha here that is 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.180
 the silveirinha that I already explained in 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.760
 previous classes 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.610
 here I have so this is what I did 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.180
 Now this I just show 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.130
 I already had this one here is the same 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.270
 leaf 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:58.200
 only it's a sheet that was shot 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.820
 We worked it out of here. 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.700
 interesting because it has this 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.780
 finish here he is already his own 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.030
 he has a talent below 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.410
 You see he's partying here in 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.080
 top of their leaves 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:17.050
 nature is perfect do not have much me 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.370
 showing this is worth the one that is the 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.820
 also made of paprika 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.010
 he looks like a sweetie 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.750
 a buck made from 12 is not from 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.760
 Even coloring seed 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.700
 so this is it I hope you have 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.190
 I like it and I make lots of pine 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.890
 both the family because the friends 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.900
 home because it 's really pretty even 

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:43.260
 in the next class I will teach to do 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:47.930
 a beautiful Christmas candlestick and I await 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.930
 you there a hug, bye
