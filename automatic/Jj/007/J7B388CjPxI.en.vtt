game on this device let's start the game

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
game on this device let's start the game
it<00:00:43.410> would<00:00:43.620> authenticate<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> game<00:00:48.329> has

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it would authenticate so the game has

now let's move on to the next game
that's<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.540> gta3<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:20.040> see<00:02:20.250> how<00:02:20.719> the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
that's the gta3 and see how the

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.530 
that's the gta3 and see how the
performance<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.469> game<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:23.120> let's<00:02:24.120> start

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
performance of that game is let's start

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:35.569 
performance of that game is let's start
a<00:02:24.780> new<00:02:24.810> game<00:02:33.349> this<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.739> big<00:02:34.980> game<00:02:35.189> so

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
a new game this is a pretty big game so

00:02:35.579 --> 00:03:24.280 
a new game this is a pretty big game so
it<00:02:35.670> would<00:02:35.849> take<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> while<00:02:55.370> what<00:02:56.370> hang<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:57.060> it

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.170 

the<00:03:25.290> Dutch<00:03:25.440> doesn't<00:03:25.980> look<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.580> much<00:03:26.700> fluid

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
the Dutch doesn't look to be much fluid

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.170 
the Dutch doesn't look to be much fluid
it's<00:03:27.360> hanging<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.380> bit<00:03:28.620> let's<00:03:29.520> proceed<00:03:29.790> with

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
it's hanging a bit let's proceed with

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.559 
it's hanging a bit let's proceed with
the<00:03:30.540> simple<00:03:31.530> game<00:03:31.709> now<00:03:31.890> that's<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.090> subway

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569

as<00:04:08.440> such<00:04:08.680> perfectly<00:04:09.280> handling<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.150> game<00:04:11.730> we

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
as such perfectly handling this game we

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.640 
as such perfectly handling this game we
don't<00:04:12.849> find<00:04:13.120> any<00:04:13.299> issues<00:04:15.959> but<00:04:16.959> again<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
don't find any issues but again the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.409 
don't find any issues but again the
subway<00:04:17.949> surface<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.400> pretty<00:04:18.699> simple<00:04:19.180> game

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
subway surface is a pretty simple game

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.779 
subway surface is a pretty simple game
and<00:04:19.479> doesn't<00:04:19.959> need<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.139> lot<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.709> memory<00:04:21.190> so

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
and doesn't need a lot of memory so

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.250 
and doesn't need a lot of memory so
let's<00:04:21.970> move<00:04:22.660> on<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.080> next<00:04:23.199> game<00:04:23.500> and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
let's move on to the next game and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.500 
let's move on to the next game and
that's<00:04:26.260> planets<00:04:26.710> vs.<00:04:27.250> zombie<00:04:27.639> -<00:04:27.820> which<00:04:28.150> is

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
that's planets vs. zombie - which is

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.000 
that's planets vs. zombie - which is
actually<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.490> resource<00:04:30.490> intensive<00:04:31.180> game<00:04:31.389> and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
actually a resource intensive game and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.050 
actually a resource intensive game and
which<00:04:33.010> would<00:04:33.100> need<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> lot<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.639> processing

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
which would need a lot of processing

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.029 
which would need a lot of processing
power<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.510> let's<00:04:34.630> see<00:04:34.900> how<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:35.590> phone<00:04:35.860> is

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
power so let's see how this phone is

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.420 
power so let's see how this phone is
going<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.340> handle<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.760> game<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:39.310> was

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
going to handle this game this was

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.590 
going to handle this game this was
recently<00:04:39.789> launched<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.360> is<00:04:40.419> available

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
recently launched and is available

00:04:40.600 --> 00:07:12.670 
recently launched and is available
worldwide<00:04:41.050> right<00:04:41.440> now

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.800 

so<00:07:13.680> we<00:07:13.830> were<00:07:13.950> also<00:07:14.160> able<00:07:14.520> to<00:07:14.730> play<00:07:15.630> this<00:07:15.750> game

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
so we were also able to play this game

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.530 
so we were also able to play this game
perfectly<00:07:16.440> had<00:07:16.560> Sopranos<00:07:17.160> Azam<00:07:17.460> B<00:07:17.610> and<00:07:17.850> the

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
phone didn't have any issues as such

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.150 
phone didn't have any issues as such
except<00:07:20.669> that<00:07:20.850> when<00:07:21.060> we<00:07:21.180> played<00:07:21.419> the<00:07:21.980> GTA<00:07:22.980> game

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 
except that when we played the GTA game

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.830 
except that when we played the GTA game
we've<00:07:23.340> read<00:07:23.669> find<00:07:23.940> that<00:07:24.120> the<00:07:24.330> device<00:07:24.570> was<00:07:24.690> not

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
we've read find that the device was not

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.600 
we've read find that the device was not
performing<00:07:25.350> up<00:07:25.770> to<00:07:25.830> the<00:07:26.010> mag<00:07:26.190> and<00:07:26.220> it<00:07:26.460> was

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
performing up to the mag and it was

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.760 
performing up to the mag and it was
hanging<00:07:26.910> a<00:07:27.090> bit<00:07:27.270> overall<00:07:28.050> a<00:07:28.200> pretty<00:07:28.380> decent

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
hanging a bit overall a pretty decent

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.590 
hanging a bit overall a pretty decent
