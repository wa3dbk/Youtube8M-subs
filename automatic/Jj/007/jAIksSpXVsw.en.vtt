one okay and if I hit bridge it'll
automatically<00:01:04.729> move<00:01:05.729> those<00:01:05.880> faces<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
automatically move those faces down and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.130 
automatically move those faces down and
join<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.439> together<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.979> me<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.840> first

more advanced so if I hit three on the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.420 
more advanced so if I hit three on the
keyboard<00:01:16.409> yeah<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.009> works<00:01:17.990> okay<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.400> let<00:01:20.400> me

happen is because it has another hole
the<00:01:46.590> bridge<00:01:46.799> command<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.490> work<00:01:49.159> okay<00:01:50.159> if

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
the bridge command will not work okay if

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.440 
the bridge command will not work okay if
it<00:01:51.570> wants<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> bridge<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.369> two<00:01:53.399> closed<00:01:54.060> holes

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it wants to bridge the two closed holes

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.670 
it wants to bridge the two closed holes
here<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> doesn't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> do<00:01:56.759> here

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680

that you must take let's say I take the
edge<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.849> this<00:02:08.849> edge<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
edge and this edge and now use the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.490 
edge and this edge and now use the
bridge<00:02:10.800> command

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
bridge command

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.150 
bridge command
okay<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.220> says<00:02:13.520> okay<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.390> looks<00:02:14.930> good

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.199 
what happens here is hopefully they
might<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.320> fixed<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.740> but<00:02:33.980> they<00:02:34.100> didn't<00:02:34.400> this

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
might have fixed it but they didn't this

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.220 
might have fixed it but they didn't this
and<00:02:35.920> why<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.990> is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
and why this is is because this is

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.990 
and why this is is because this is
bridge<00:02:39.530> together<00:02:39.800> doesn't<00:02:40.400> mean<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
bridge together doesn't mean the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.520 
bridge together doesn't mean the
vertices<00:02:41.330> are<00:02:41.720> actually<00:02:42.080> merged<00:02:42.290> together

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
vertices are actually merged together

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.420 
vertices are actually merged together
and<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.900> go<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.170> use<00:02:45.440> such<00:02:45.709> tools<00:02:46.130> as

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and when you go to use such tools as

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.330 
and when you go to use such tools as
merge<00:02:46.970> edge<00:02:47.180> tool<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:48.530> merge<00:02:48.739> these<00:02:48.950> edges

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
merge edge tool to merge these edges

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.699 
merge edge tool to merge these edges
together<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.910> fails<00:02:50.330> okay<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.290> has<00:02:51.440> been<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
together it fails okay this has been a

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.790 
together it fails okay this has been a
long<00:02:52.040> time<00:02:52.400> standing<00:02:52.940> thing<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:54.500> any

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
long time standing thing with any

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.510 
long time standing thing with any
version<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.310> Maya<00:02:55.630> okay<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.860> what<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:58.340> to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
version of Maya okay so what you have to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.830 
version of Maya okay so what you have to
do<00:02:58.670> here<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.110> highlight<00:03:00.110> all<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.290> vertices

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
do here is highlight all the vertices

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.199 
do here is highlight all the vertices
okay<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.310> highlight<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.670> lot<00:03:05.060> of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
okay and you can highlight a lot of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.660 
okay and you can highlight a lot of
vertices<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.989> doesn't<00:03:06.770> matter<00:03:06.920> because<00:03:07.220> you

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
vertices it doesn't matter because you

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.900 
vertices it doesn't matter because you
just<00:03:07.910> really<00:03:08.209> need<00:03:08.360> those<00:03:08.570> 14<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:10.280> make<00:03:10.700> up

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
just really need those 14 that make up

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.320 
just really need those 14 that make up
this<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.380> area<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:12.920> then<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.150> go

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
this in this area and then I can go

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.390 
this in this area and then I can go
merge<00:03:16.239> all<00:03:17.239> right<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:17.750> if<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.320> go<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:19.100> this

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
merge all right now if I go like this

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.430 
merge all right now if I go like this
and<00:03:19.459> hit<00:03:19.790> three<00:03:20.030> in<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.209> keyboard<00:03:20.630> it's<00:03:21.049> still

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
and hit three in the keyboard it's still

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.050 
and hit three in the keyboard it's still
there<00:03:21.739> why<00:03:22.370> well<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.440> all<00:03:24.440> actuality<00:03:24.820> if<00:03:25.820> I

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
there why well in all actuality if I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.289 
there why well in all actuality if I
grab<00:03:26.330> one<00:03:26.870> vertice<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.590> move<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.299> there

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
grab one vertice and move it there

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.630 
grab one vertice and move it there
they're<00:03:29.690> actually<00:03:30.019> merged<00:03:30.230> together<00:03:30.640> but

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
they're actually merged together but

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.729 
they're actually merged together but
again<00:03:32.030> there's<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.780> one<00:03:33.049> thing<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
again there's this one thing that you

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.080 
again there's this one thing that you
have<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:34.010> kind<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.670> know<00:03:35.000> about<00:03:35.269> Maya<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:37.090> it

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
have to kind of know about Maya is it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.810 
have to kind of know about Maya is it
has<00:03:38.660> some<00:03:39.410> tendencies<00:03:40.100> throughout<00:03:40.760> all

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
has some tendencies throughout all

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.840 
has some tendencies throughout all
versions<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.780> do<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.160> what<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.489> have<00:03:43.670> to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
versions to do this so what you have to

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.350 
versions to do this so what you have to
do<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:46.180> write<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.390> down<00:03:47.630> in<00:03:47.690> your

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
do is this write this down in your

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.789 
do is this write this down in your
problem<00:03:50.360> thing<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.320> plugin<00:03:51.769> manager

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
problem thing so this is plugin manager

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.460 
problem thing so this is plugin manager
and<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.670> you're<00:03:52.820> new<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:52.970> Maya<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:54.350> don't

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
and if you're new to Maya and you don't

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.949 
and if you're new to Maya and you don't
know<00:03:54.680> how<00:03:54.829> to<00:03:54.860> export<00:03:55.340> obj<00:03:55.910> here's<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.049> obj

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
know how to export obj here's the obj

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.500 
know how to export obj here's the obj
okay<00:03:59.959> close<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.160> what<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.820> do<00:04:01.940> here<00:04:02.390> is

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
okay close it out and what I do here is

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.080 
okay close it out and what I do here is
I<00:04:03.110> go<00:04:03.290> file<00:04:04.329> export<00:04:05.329> selection<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:06.670> export<00:04:07.670> onto

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
I go file export selection I export onto

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.470 
I go file export selection I export onto
the<00:04:08.209> desktop<00:04:08.570> as

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:28.110 

needs<00:04:15.480> fixed<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:17.090> choose<00:04:18.090> obj<00:04:18.780> must<00:04:19.350> be<00:04:19.530> obj

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.270 

export<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.210> out<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.800> move<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.949> off<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.100> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
export it out and move it off to the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.920 
export it out and move it off to the
side<00:04:35.830> okay<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.100> then<00:04:37.910> go<00:04:38.270> file<00:04:38.630> import<00:04:39.169> and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
side okay and then go file import and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.909 
side okay and then go file import and
import<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.139> in<00:04:43.840> all<00:04:44.840> right<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:45.560> if<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.770> had

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
import that in all right so if I had

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.640 
import that in all right so if I had
three<00:04:46.100> on<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.250> keyboard<00:04:46.639> it's<00:04:47.060> fixed<00:04:47.650> all

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
three on the keyboard it's fixed all

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.340 
three on the keyboard it's fixed all
right<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.550> guess<00:04:50.389> which<00:04:50.570> command<00:04:50.960> i'm<00:04:51.110> going

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
right so guess which command i'm going

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.020 
right so guess which command i'm going
to<00:04:51.440> be<00:04:51.560> using<00:04:51.590> i'm<00:04:52.100> going<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.370> probably<00:04:52.550> using

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
to be using i'm going to probably using

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.080 
to be using i'm going to probably using
it<00:04:53.150> manually<00:04:53.690> or<00:04:53.930> bridge<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.820> third

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
it manually or bridge that the third

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.510 
it manually or bridge that the third
option<00:04:56.300> i<00:04:56.630> showed<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:57.130> you're<00:04:58.130> going<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> run

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
option i showed you you're going to run

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.870 
option i showed you you're going to run
into<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:59.080> eventually<00:05:00.080> but<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.130> like<00:05:01.610> showing

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
into it eventually but I like showing

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.939 
into it eventually but I like showing
all<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.330> debugging<00:05:03.020> tools<00:05:03.470> all<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.860> way

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
all the debugging tools all the way

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.909 
all the debugging tools all the way
through<00:05:04.310> by<00:05:05.180> exporting<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.960> an<00:05:06.139> obj<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:06.770> re

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
through by exporting is an obj and re

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.070 
through by exporting is an obj and re
importing<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.520> back<00:05:07.699> in<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.240> actually<00:05:08.449> fixes<00:05:09.050> a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
importing it back in it actually fixes a

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.890 
importing it back in it actually fixes a
lot<00:05:09.169> of<00:05:09.650> problematic<00:05:10.130> things<00:05:10.520> within<00:05:11.300> the

lot of problematic things within the

lot of problematic things within the
