heels obviously the third group does the
exact<00:02:28.099> same<00:02:28.129> thing<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:29.420> two<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.019> three<00:02:30.260> and

four and five and six and seven eight
and<00:02:32.510> everyone<00:02:33.079> does<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> little<00:02:33.439> suit<00:02:33.709> anew<00:02:33.950> one

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
and everyone does a little suit anew one

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.390 
and everyone does a little suit anew one
two<00:02:35.209> three<00:02:35.689> four<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.439> then<00:02:36.469> you'll<00:02:36.980> find<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
two three four and then you'll find the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.949 
two three four and then you'll find the
shuffle<00:02:37.760> ball<00:02:37.909> change<00:02:40.480> okay<00:02:41.480> let's<00:02:41.659> move<00:02:41.780> on

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
shuffle ball change okay let's move on

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.569 
shuffle ball change okay let's move on
to<00:02:42.079> our<00:02:42.169> third<00:02:42.290> routine<00:02:42.980> now<00:02:43.159> this<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.459> the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
to our third routine now this is the

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.659 
to our third routine now this is the
hardest<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.120> longest<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.840> three<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:45.669 
hardest and longest of the three and

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.459 
hardest and longest of the three and
this<00:02:46.669> is<00:02:46.879> kind<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.209> more<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.510> an<00:02:47.629> advanced

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
this is kind of more of an advanced

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.369 
this is kind of more of an advanced
beginner<00:02:48.819> routine<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:50.450> might<00:02:50.480> even<00:02:50.870> feel

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
beginner routine you might even feel

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.050 
beginner routine you might even feel
that<00:02:51.439> it's<00:02:51.799> more<00:02:52.069> of<00:02:52.129> a<00:02:52.219> slow<00:02:52.430> intermediate

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that it's more of a slow intermediate

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.959 
that it's more of a slow intermediate
but<00:02:53.299> certainly<00:02:54.049> all<00:02:54.349> of<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:54.980> steps<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.819> are

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
but certainly all of the steps in it are

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.539 
but certainly all of the steps in it are
beginner<00:02:56.389> level<00:02:56.629> steps<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.709> speed<00:02:58.219> of<00:02:58.430> the

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
beginner level steps the speed of the

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.300 
beginner level steps the speed of the
number<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.719> fact<00:03:00.049> that<00:03:00.260> steps<00:03:00.799> don't<00:03:01.129> do

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
number and the fact that steps don't do

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.300 
number and the fact that steps don't do
there's<00:03:02.269> very<00:03:02.659> little<00:03:03.139> repetition<00:03:04.010> except

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
there's very little repetition except

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.270 
there's very little repetition except
for<00:03:04.459> one<00:03:04.579> particular<00:03:04.790> step<00:03:05.449> so<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.409> makes<00:03:07.010> it

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
for one particular step so that makes it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.039 
for one particular step so that makes it
more<00:03:07.579> difficult<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:08.329> learn<00:03:08.659> because<00:03:08.900> you

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
more difficult to learn because you

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.530 
more difficult to learn because you
aren't<00:03:09.260> repeating<00:03:09.799> as<00:03:09.949> much<00:03:10.389> phrasing<00:03:11.389> is<00:03:11.510> a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
aren't repeating as much phrasing is a

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.909 
aren't repeating as much phrasing is a
little<00:03:11.780> bit<00:03:11.930> different<00:03:12.379> there's<00:03:12.560> some<00:03:12.709> odd

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
little bit different there's some odd

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.800 
little bit different there's some odd
eight<00:03:13.250> counts<00:03:13.699> and<00:03:13.819> some<00:03:13.969> odd<00:03:14.150> four<00:03:14.569> count

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
eight counts and some odd four count

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.750 
eight counts and some odd four count
phrases<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.349> that's<00:03:15.799> what<00:03:16.159> makes<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.609> a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
phrases and that's what makes it a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.149 
phrases and that's what makes it a
little<00:03:17.329> harder<00:03:17.810> but<00:03:18.259> if<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.500> take<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.919> time

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
little harder but if you take the time

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.369 
little harder but if you take the time
to<00:03:19.220> teach<00:03:19.759> it<00:03:20.000> over<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.329> long<00:03:20.599> period<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.139> time

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
to teach it over a long period of time

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.830 
to teach it over a long period of time
then<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.189> difficulty<00:03:22.609> that<00:03:22.819> component<00:03:23.629> comes

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
then the difficulty that component comes

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.719 
then the difficulty that component comes
out<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.259> the<00:03:24.349> routine<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.919> it's<00:03:25.370> as<00:03:25.519> much<00:03:25.669> a

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
out of the routine and it's as much a

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.140 
out of the routine and it's as much a
beginner<00:03:26.090> routine<00:03:26.509> as<00:03:26.720> anything<00:03:27.319> else

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
beginner routine as anything else

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.610 
beginner routine as anything else
probably<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.419> most<00:03:29.629> difficult<00:03:29.930> thing<00:03:30.409> in<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
probably the most difficult thing in the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.729 
probably the most difficult thing in the
dance<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.129> whole<00:03:31.549> round<00:03:32.269> break<00:03:33.019> that's

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
dance is a whole round break that's

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.349 
dance is a whole round break that's
probably<00:03:34.189> the<00:03:34.340> most<00:03:34.459> difficult<00:03:34.970> step<00:03:35.060> now

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
probably the most difficult step now

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.479 
probably the most difficult step now
we're<00:03:35.479> dancing<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.989> rock<00:03:36.259> and<00:03:36.470> roll<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.430> you

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
we're dancing to rock and roll so you

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.159 
we're dancing to rock and roll so you
would<00:03:37.699> want<00:03:37.729> a<00:03:37.939> big<00:03:38.239> group<00:03:38.479> of<00:03:38.569> students<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:38.959> do

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
would want a big group of students to do

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.390 
would want a big group of students to do
this<00:03:39.319> so<00:03:39.530> they<00:03:39.620> could<00:03:39.680> be<00:03:39.889> heard<00:03:40.099> over<00:03:40.280> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
this so they could be heard over the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.939 
this so they could be heard over the
brass<00:03:40.669> because<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.359> is<00:03:41.509> -<00:03:41.629> a<00:03:41.689> song<00:03:41.930> from<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.849 
group Brian Setzer Orchestra so it's
very<00:03:45.829> brassy<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.459> very<00:03:46.729> big<00:03:47.000> yeah<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.709> from

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
very brassy and very big yeah so from

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.399 
very brassy and very big yeah so from
the<00:03:48.979> Charleston<00:03:49.489> we<00:03:49.609> have<00:03:49.819> one<00:03:50.569> two<00:03:50.959> three

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
the Charleston we have one two three

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.710 
the Charleston we have one two three
four<00:03:51.799> five<00:03:52.189> six<00:03:52.549> second<00:03:53.150> time<00:03:53.299> is<00:03:53.509> different

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
four five six second time is different

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.890 
four five six second time is different
two<00:03:54.049> three<00:03:54.470> four<00:03:54.859> five<00:03:55.220> six<00:03:55.549> seven<00:03:55.939> one<00:03:56.269> two

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
two three four five six seven one two

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.360 
two three four five six seven one two
three<00:03:57.079> four<00:03:57.769> five<00:03:58.159> six<00:03:58.519> seven<00:03:58.879> eight

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.440 

that's<00:04:02.370> how<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.550> whole<00:04:02.730> thing<00:04:02.760> works<00:04:03.180> now

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
that's how the whole thing works now

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.370 
that's how the whole thing works now
again<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.590> may<00:04:04.740> do<00:04:05.600> single<00:04:06.600> time<00:04:06.780> step<00:04:06.930> double

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
again you may do single time step double

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.260 
again you may do single time step double
time<00:04:07.530> step<00:04:07.770> triple<00:04:07.980> time<00:04:08.280> step<00:04:08.550> but<00:04:08.940> I'm<00:04:09.030> going

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
time step triple time step but I'm going

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.840 
time step triple time step but I'm going
back<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.660> triple<00:04:13.250> this<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.640> half

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
back to the triple this is the half
