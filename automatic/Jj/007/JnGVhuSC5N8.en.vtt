00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.470 

and<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:37.990> section<00:02:38.470> at<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.680> time<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:40.420> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:14.800 

here's<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.030> first

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.809 

notice<00:03:15.650> I'm<00:03:15.800> not<00:03:15.830> bunching<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.640> ends

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
notice I'm not bunching the ends

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.930 
notice I'm not bunching the ends
together

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.030 

and<00:03:23.360> just<00:03:23.600> kind<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.840> squeeze<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.260> down<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
and just kind of squeeze it down the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:42.240 
and just kind of squeeze it down the
haircalf<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.370> end

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.900 

so<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.120> section<00:03:43.540> 1<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.520> next

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
so this is section 1 this is this next

00:03:45.910 --> 00:04:15.510 
so this is section 1 this is this next
section<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.930> second<00:03:47.260> part<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.620> front

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.590 

leave<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.600> end

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.300 

the<00:04:22.170> idea<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.710> not<00:04:23.070> once<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.940> hair<00:04:24.180> up<00:04:25.310> so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
the idea is to not once the hair up so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.220 
the idea is to not once the hair up so
I'll<00:04:26.490> continue<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.970> do<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.300> for<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
I'll continue to do that for that the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.500 
I'll continue to do that for that the
back<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:29.010> back<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.340> section<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:33.300> is

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
back on the back to section and this is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.990 
back on the back to section and this is
just<00:04:33.780> better<00:04:34.380> than<00:04:34.860> grabbing<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.790> hair

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
just better than grabbing the hair

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.510 
just better than grabbing the hair
together<00:04:36.470> shampooing<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.190> you're<00:04:38.370> in
