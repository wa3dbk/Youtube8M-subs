00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.789
 there is a bracket for mounting the flashlight on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.189
 seatpost and patrick himself 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.540
 parts there is a button to switch 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.660
 LED modes and a button for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.059
 laser laser and shines here from these two 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 holes 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.379
 inside 5 LEDs are inserted here 2 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.140
 type 3a batteries 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.260
 let's immediately put and show how he 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260
 works 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.090
 closing let's start with LEDs 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.820
 first mode all LEDs are lit 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.840
 at the same time the second mode is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.960
 pulsating 3 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.860
 only ripple slow 4 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.340
 the path runs from right to left 5 is the same 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.850
 track only left to right 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 6 I donâ€™t know what I think 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:42.000
 chaotic megane ii 7 mode track 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.950
 runs right to left and then faces left 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.189
 right that's all the laser mode works 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.759
 like this with a single 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.630
 pressed you get these two laser 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.310
 tracks if you press the second time these 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.310
 tracks 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 blink 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.239
 on the bracket the flashlight is attached like this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.310
 way here is 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.010
 fixing such a buckle that is 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.780
 when he strapped on nowhere 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.700
 the bracket will also pop up 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.989
 has the ability to adjust faith down 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.200
 there are three brush that is possible 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.470
 adjust as you need and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.890
 fix keeps up pretty well i 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.620
 I think that can not fall off but if 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.730
 of course you won't jump at night 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:55.269
 springboard in my opinion mount 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.099
 good specially turned off the light to 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:05.799
 show how about the lantern will be 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:09.190
 shine in the dark in my opinion brightness 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.890
 more than enough and if similar 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.209
 the flashlight will be on your bike not 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.480
 it will be very difficult to notice you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.799
 let's see how lasers shine 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.630
 now I raised it by about 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.260
 about a meter from the floor now 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.260
 2 meters 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.220
 and now the distance from the floor is about three 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.569
 and a half meter and this one already hold it 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.569
 under the ceiling kid 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:48.440
 it is clear that there are no problems with lasers 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.579
 No, and the distance to the bike will be 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.079
 clearly I can recommend this 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.569
 flashlight for all cyclists 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.140
 a device that costs only 150 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.299
 rubles if you know how much like 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.459
 lanterns are you write in 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.170
 comments but I think that we have 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.349
 Russia in online stores they 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.280
 likely to sell rubles for 500 600 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:20.590
 and maybe even more expensive on it all 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.590
