automatic the element you'd have to hold

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.610 
automatic the element you'd have to hold
for<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:06.970> many<00:04:07.030> revolutions<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.290> then<00:04:08.410> hold

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
for so many revolutions and then hold

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.440 
for so many revolutions and then hold
for<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:08.950> many<00:04:09.070> revolutions<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:09.940> will<00:04:10.120> be<00:04:10.270> not

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
for so many revolutions this will be not

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.360 
for so many revolutions this will be not
happy<00:04:12.600> Wow<00:04:13.680> two<00:04:14.680> hundred<00:04:14.920> dollars<00:04:15.340> cheaper
