I haven't actually plugged it in yet but
I<00:00:59.030> mean<00:01:00.030> I'm<00:01:00.149> sure<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.420> sounds<00:01:00.629> amazing<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

has so much tone and so much sustain

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
has so much tone and so much sustain
that<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.840> obviously<00:01:04.049> you're<00:01:04.379> going

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that is one thing obviously you're going

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
that is one thing obviously you're going
to<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.159> such<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> big<00:01:05.610> body<00:01:05.880> guitar

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to get out of such a big body guitar

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
to get out of such a big body guitar
like<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.600> you're<00:01:07.470> gonna<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.040> tone

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
like this you're gonna get so much tone

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.380 
like this you're gonna get so much tone
and<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.030> much<00:01:09.180> you're<00:01:09.270> saying<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.510> mean

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:21.000 

then<00:01:14.050> it'll<00:01:14.230> hold<00:01:14.590> forever<00:01:17.730> but<00:01:18.730> anyway<00:01:20.010> this

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
then it'll hold forever but anyway this

00:01:21.010 --> 00:02:10.960 
then it'll hold forever but anyway this
isn't<00:01:21.370> like<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.730> small<00:01:22.030> review<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.450> it

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.089 

suppose<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.209> hear<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.500> much<00:02:13.830> tone

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
suppose you can hear it is so much tone

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.949 
suppose you can hear it is so much tone
and<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.730> loud<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.330> beautiful<00:02:15.810> guitar

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and it's so loud it's a beautiful guitar

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.070 
and it's so loud it's a beautiful guitar
I<00:02:16.409> would<00:02:16.860> totally<00:02:17.129> recommend<00:02:17.430> getting<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.420> it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
I would totally recommend getting one it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.229 
I would totally recommend getting one it
adds<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.709> much<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.459> guitar<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.909> so<00:02:21.090> much

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
adds so much to your guitar and so much

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.570 
adds so much to your guitar and so much
deploying<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.900> there's<00:02:22.470> such<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.680> huge<00:02:23.010> bass

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
deploying and there's such a huge bass

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.490 
deploying and there's such a huge bass
note<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> even<00:02:24.989> sounds<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.230> there's<00:02:25.440> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
note so it even sounds like there's a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.690 
note so it even sounds like there's a
bass<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.890> background<00:02:26.310> half<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.519> time

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
bass in the background half the time

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.309 
bass in the background half the time
people<00:02:26.909> can't<00:02:27.480> even<00:02:27.659> tell<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.110> they're

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
people can't even tell because they're

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.030 
people can't even tell because they're
so<00:02:28.530> big

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
so big

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280 
so big
there<00:02:29.730> actually<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:30.120> big<00:02:30.450> as<00:02:30.810> an<00:02:31.019> acoustic

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
there actually is big as an acoustic

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
there actually is big as an acoustic
bass<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.890> body<00:02:32.190> almost<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:32.970> could

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
bass is body almost and you could

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.699 
bass is body almost and you could
definitely<00:02:33.329> make<00:02:33.599> an<00:02:33.810> acoustic<00:02:34.230> bass<00:02:34.409> this

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
definitely make an acoustic bass this

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.170 
definitely make an acoustic bass this
size<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.400> actually<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:35.790> think<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
size and what actually I think would be

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.930 
size and what actually I think would be
a<00:02:36.299> wonderful<00:02:36.720> idea<00:02:37.110> for<00:02:37.620> Martin<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.400> invest<00:02:38.700> in

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
a wonderful idea for Martin to invest in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.000 
a wonderful idea for Martin to invest in
but<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.540> think<00:02:39.840> about<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.290> I'd<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.829> pretty

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
but just think about that I'd be pretty

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.369 
but just think about that I'd be pretty
cool<00:02:41.280> looking<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.670> grand<00:02:41.879> jumbo<00:02:42.209> babes<00:02:42.450> but

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
cool looking a grand jumbo babes but

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.500 
cool looking a grand jumbo babes but
