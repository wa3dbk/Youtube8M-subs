00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.620
 wise 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:20.729
 He died around talking 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.810
 beware of reflections in which you have 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.810
 inside 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.010
 imagine that there was something 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.920

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.940
 free 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.240

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.240
 until then 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:20.180
 It turns out that unscrewing this 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:24.770
 plate in which the Flemish only raises 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.860
 here it goes beyond connecting 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.730

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:55.860
 specific does not always leave forgiveness 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.099
 Give it to those who are already screwed 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.099
 to mix things up 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:29.289
