we'll just kill all the cops that come
after<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:03.000> it's<00:05:04.000> not<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.450> hard<00:05:05.220> until<00:05:06.220> you

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
after you it's not that hard until you

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.610 
after you it's not that hard until you
start<00:05:07.060> getting<00:05:07.210> more<00:05:07.540> stars<00:05:07.960> from<00:05:08.110> killing

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
start getting more stars from killing

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.550 
start getting more stars from killing
them<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.820> then<00:05:10.090> it's<00:05:10.330> really<00:05:10.570> hard<00:05:10.780> so<00:05:11.470> you

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
them and then it's really hard so you

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.920 
them and then it's really hard so you
should<00:05:12.130> have<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.550> lot<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.060> ammo<00:05:13.390> for<00:05:13.750> this

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
should have a lot of ammo for this

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.560 
should have a lot of ammo for this
mission<00:05:15.030> like<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.210> lot<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.660> ammo<00:05:16.950> particularly

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
mission like a lot of ammo particularly

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:27.180 
mission like a lot of ammo particularly
ak-47<00:05:19.570> mo<00:05:19.930> or<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:22.510> bit<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.050> salsa<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.770> if<00:05:26.980> you

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
ak-47 mo or a bit of salsa so if you

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.550 
ak-47 mo or a bit of salsa so if you
don't<00:05:27.310> have<00:05:27.610> three<00:05:27.970> stars<00:05:28.210> already<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.930> think

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
don't have three stars already I think

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.440 
don't have three stars already I think
once<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:30.190> have<00:05:30.370> two<00:05:30.580> minutes<00:05:30.790> left<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.300> will

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
once you have two minutes left it will

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.630 
once you have two minutes left it will
give<00:05:31.660> you<00:05:31.840> your<00:05:32.200> character<00:05:32.650> three<00:05:32.950> stars<00:05:33.250> and

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
give you your character three stars and

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.630 
give you your character three stars and
then<00:05:34.300> once<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.660> has<00:05:34.780> one<00:05:35.080> minute<00:05:35.350> left<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:36.340> will

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
then once it has one minute left it will

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
then once it has one minute left it will
give<00:05:36.820> your<00:05:36.940> character<00:05:37.570> four<00:05:38.230> stars
