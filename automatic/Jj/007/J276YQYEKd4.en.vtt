00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.309
 cooking 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.860
 and we will make a chocolate fountain for 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.160
 we need this icing sugar 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.230

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 for the sake of a fighter 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.930
 cocoa baking powder molds also us 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.260
 you will need 3 fishing lines one big and two 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.260
 little ones 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:42.870
 this is copper to begin with we will have to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:01:24.450
 separate we will have to separate the yolk 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:01:27.080
 from me personally I have a little bit this side type 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080
 yolk 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.770
 we separated the protein white and yolk 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.250
 now we have to add to this yolk 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.720
 1 table spoon 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.720
 until i did 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.769
 or who is confused 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.260
 this protein is as far as it should be added now 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.260
 one teaspoon baking powder here too 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:04:02.459
 when he would add half protein 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:15.980
 a teaspoon of caster sugar and add 2 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:15.980
 tablespoons of flour and must be crushed 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:40.289
 otherwise 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:43.339
 pour our little pan and now we need 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:52.079
 add translation 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:55.529
 you are a protein of some kind that the family is not that 

00:04:52.079 --> 00:05:00.439
 need to mix and molds need 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.439
 lubricate you exactly on that photo 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:10.169
 Everything is fine now when we mix 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.539
 we can water him all this mass 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.099
 bottles yes you just need to fill 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.979
 the molds are not easy because 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:21.319
 the oven then the fountain will swell and 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.319
 as it will become 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.210
