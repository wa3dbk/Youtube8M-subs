00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 a beautiful monday here in the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.970
 movie lounge was the trailer for you now 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.220
 and the review that you are not 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.230
 you one and bianca finds out that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.300
 to leave behind your back 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.049
 that she is doing a so-called data 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.730
 is alien and accordingly acts 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 then no longer tries on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 takes her swarm tobi to make 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 the very pretty charming typical 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.099
 athlete wesley he is supposed to help 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 to put down the image 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.609
 while she gives him tuition there 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 maybe in the act one more 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.880
 little else can happen 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.940
 to imagine how they first time 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 looks like that afterwards 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.719
 Let's talk about drawers, there are those 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.460

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.989

 Information about my girlfriend drove 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.949
 somehow already you are rather that 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:59.420

 sexy is hotter for her friends 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.909
 it's easier to do that out 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.250
 appeal because they are not rare 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.250
 directly with you soon with her 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 why did you tell me that I have yours 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.550
 this will be ours never heard before 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 under no circumstance 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.450
 but you have that but I want 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.929
 not allowed but saved 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.880
 becomes 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.560
 you help me and I help in 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 chemistry there you have the easy parc you 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 you run around in pajamas and I have to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.640
 in things I openness with 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.539
 Jazz and Casey can go the family 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.830
 hard facts 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.149
 so his website hides one 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.929
 posture is for the ass and you 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.090
 get dressed like bob the builder you 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.560
 interested here so no you are 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.560
 just as great as you feel about yourself 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:04.990
 I have what you all want 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.550
 few years, it creates a highschool 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.679
 Comedy so typical of the 90s 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.479
 years were also at the box office today 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.800
 and also to the quality really too 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.100
 persuade I still like to remember 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.810
 I also liked emma stone very much 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.900
 very cool and he always has 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.270
 a figure moved the focus and even 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.400
 the story why does that matter 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.020
 may be relatively charming here 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.180
 i like the main character of the first one 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.310
 seconds and follow them too and 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.690
 can always imagine ok at 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.400
 one or the other embarrassment one 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.350
 that's pretty stupid of you right now 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.640
 but also funny and somehow 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.950
 I first nice that the film one 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.570
 main character has sympathized with the I 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.070
 and I like that 's for 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.989
 Such films extremely important because 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.720
 Of course , the script also happened 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.970
 a lot of conventional one can 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.100
 always imagine what such milestones 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 you have to reach the end of that 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.390
 logical result in any kind and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.459
 wise to celebrate that but I think 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.049
 Not at all bad if you join 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.160
 the figures somehow in good hands 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.910
 also feels the minor characters are 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.530
 actually all 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.450
 just for his high school comedy wo 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.370
 many newcomers are well played 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.380
 one does not like that so the movie goes 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.700
 easily easily from the one of the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.709
 Action is a pretty good summer 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.660
 film so if you are friends 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.850
 That's a good thing to look at 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.450
 It's a pity that you can 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.370
 relatively actually looks pretty okay 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.160
 our main character is our bianca the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.200
 now maybe not the top model 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.940
 she immediately realizes she is not ugly to her 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.470
 is somehow something cool and cool 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
 see her two best friends 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.920
 just rather than when you're out 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.400
 the building from top to bottom zugekleistert 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.230
 that's the beauty ideal now 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.910
 is synonymous after a movie about it 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.370
 to be yourself and so on and so forth 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.500
 Do you find it a pity because you are 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.790
 it just looks the same and thinks you have 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.750
 always okay if you already have the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.640
 should be fat 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.660
 what should happen now somehow 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.250
 girls think what maybe now 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.850
 really ten kilo too much on the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.920
 has ribs 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.180
 life is not over my god 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.270
 everything is just fine 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.710
 these are 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.990
 moral things maybe I am there 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.640
 now also very critical but for the 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.350
 credibility is a transformation 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.720
 takes place from the ugly duckling 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.460
 to the beautiful swan therefore with 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.530
 Announcement can be seen after two minutes 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.750
 that's a pity overall 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.270
 but quite entertaining though 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.489
 conventional but fun 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.260
 harmless you can look at it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.790
 kind and solid 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.959
 above average six out of nine 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.360
 score for fans of the genre 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.730
 surely he too can be his seven 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.100
 In any case, what you give yourself 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.990
 By the way, can give is my revier 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.470
 to the current blockbuster this is the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.180
 Jurassier I was left you down here 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.150

 new criticism in the film lounge with her

 I'm fine
