00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.780
 Me 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.480
 me 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.580
 me 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.440
 Yup 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.480
 Hmm 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.390
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.160
 car 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.290
 Ten 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.170
 Minor Seventh is the Hiroshima of little influence with the negation of the house this time today 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.789
 9th of this 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.420
 I think that I want to introduce the presser way of tension code 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:40.379
 This is also the last time the same major 7 number 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:45.300
 Initially just to remember and after the end of 9 several put mousse 9th of 7th 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.260
 Theft of whether to move Please remember the 9th of minor 7th 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 c 7 Please hold back 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.800
 It is the third thing that changes from this form this time 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.730
 The third is the flat version 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.090
 Then 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.970
 Because it is completed 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:11.520
 When this process is us remember the 9th of sems to remember prop once the main text 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.770
 You since become Fu that only one place where change 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.479
 If you haven't seen it, please have a look at it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 We go from a little working please try at So once technical college king from remember 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.770
 c Minor I can do nice creatures 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.930
 d flat g 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.230
 And b flat 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.230
 Puy 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.510
 Ukraine sad There is also 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.930
 A little dangerous 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.470
 It is a very nice action 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 I think it sounds like a comfortable code, too 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.610
 People and those who start from the 7th start from third 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.610
 First let's remember this 2 type 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.450
 It is a putter starting from the third- 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.500
 e- fran and gb flat d 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.060
 Yup 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.789
 me 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.430
 This is the first one 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.430
 And the other one began with a sense 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.010
 Hmm 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.840
 d flat boon 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.140
 Etc. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.140
 Yup 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:38.659
 Please remember with these two types 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.160
 So I think it is better to practice the c 7 c minor 7 number this time 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:51.820
 I will 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:51.820
 c 7 If it is convenient to start with this form third , climb the third hill from there 2 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.080
 Yup 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.710
 A few people make Imai sound 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.310
 Of course there are not both 1 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.310
 Oh ー ー ー

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.660
 And at f's time, this is the same f 7th 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.330
 Hmm 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.140
 And if you go down to the third edition the list of f -7 states 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.700
 car 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.800
 If this flow is understood, in fact 4 kinds will suddenly 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.380
 c minor 7 numbers 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.380
 And f before 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 Chi Miner 7th 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.070
 to f minor 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.940
 I think that good to go caught in the wind that 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.030
 a 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.120
 The c minor 7th in stylish because it is 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.880
 It is that you must remember when trying to remember the 9th 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.290
 Huh 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.530
 I am remember the first major seventh of such Shiosu it will become a lot 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.620
 7 is lowered so semitone from there 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.130
 c of the code is a good anything, but it is of the Ace 7th and 7th not do the scan 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.900
 From 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:10.190
 If you lower minor third by half this time, the number of minors 7 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.300
 To the Fu that it is nice 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.530
 As you remember 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.060
 I think it will be very easy because there will be only one change 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.980
 By the way to 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.280
 Hmm 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.820
 The putter I did in the first intro was 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.470
 c minor 7 numbers 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.409
 b flat minor 7 number 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.260
 And let me sister a flat minor 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.310
 Before the dough 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.310
 Cebu province with no Sutuｰ 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.180
 I met in the code progress saying that this is all 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.430
 If we begin from the 7th 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.760
 That's 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:55.200
 Remember that when you start with seven 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.960
 It is that the 9th and minor lure are also 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:04.400
 that 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:08.969
 But it is always you there are people who think what points the previous 9 s and the third is when the third 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.390
 But when you Ona two of the minor capsid of the 7th Well is 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.700
 Instrumental 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.930
 When the minor third is going to think the wind called painted 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.930
 I think it is easy to understand 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:25.480
 This will be the thing 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:29.710
 This is minor 7 number 9 states and 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:36.430
 7th Seedlings and Major Sevens Nice 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:41.740
 If it comes to be suppressed only this time, it will start from the minor seventh in the actual music 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:45.470
 When the chord progression like that, such as going to the 7th 2 points major seventh is a lot 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:49.600
 We actually going out and I think because where application 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.600
 I think that 's the best then I'm sorry
