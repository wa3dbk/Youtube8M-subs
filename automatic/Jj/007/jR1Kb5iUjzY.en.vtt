the edge being bent over but this thing
this<00:00:54.030> stuff<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.960> didn't<00:00:55.379> realize<00:00:55.620> how

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this stuff is I didn't realize how

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.130 
this stuff is I didn't realize how
imprecise<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.890> crude<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.250> how

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
imprecise it was and how crude and how

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.170 
imprecise it was and how crude and how
non-productive<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.530> until<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.370> started

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
non-productive it was until I started

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
non-productive it was until I started
looking<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> answer<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.110> found<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
looking for the answer and found the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
looking for the answer and found the
answer<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.519> problems<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
answer to these problems and that is

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
answer to these problems and that is
this<00:01:07.049> edge<00:01:07.320> tool<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> talk

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this edge tool that we're going to talk

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
this edge tool that we're going to talk
about<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.640> why<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.479> such<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> big<00:01:10.110> deal

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
about now why is this such a big deal

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
about now why is this such a big deal
before<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> edge<00:01:11.490> tool<00:01:11.700> let's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
before we get into the edge tool let's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.210 
before we get into the edge tool let's
talk<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.119> why<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:14.040> as

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
talk about why this is just not as

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
talk about why this is just not as
precise<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.210> let's<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
precise as it could be let's look go to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
precise as it could be let's look go to
the<00:01:16.320> chalkboard<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.119> look<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:19.130> Denton's<00:01:20.130> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the chalkboard and look at a Denton's in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.940 
the chalkboard and look at a Denton's in
it<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.850> double<00:01:21.090> seam<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> you've

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it that is in a double seam so you've

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.840 
it that is in a double seam so you've
got<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> skin<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.000> here's<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> dent

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
got the skin here and here's the dent

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.609 
got the skin here and here's the dent
here's<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> double<00:01:27.330> seen<00:01:27.570> sometimes<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
here's the double seen sometimes the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
here's the double seen sometimes the
double<00:01:28.920> seam<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.250> been<00:01:29.460> also<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
double seam has been also and you can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
double seam has been also and you can
see<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> seam<00:01:31.140> has<00:01:31.259> bent<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> we

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
see that the seam has bent and we

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
see that the seam has bent and we
haven't<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.390> advantage<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:33.960> using

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
haven't that's an advantage when using

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
haven't that's an advantage when using
this<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:38.000> bent

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this you can actually put it on the bent

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
this you can actually put it on the bent
part<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> knock<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.049> most<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
part and knock it up but most of the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.170 
part and knock it up but most of the
time<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.280> can't<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> lot<00:01:42.150> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
time we can't see it because a lot of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
time we can't see it because a lot of
time<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.320> sealer<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.490> edge

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
time it's in that that sealer the edge

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.179 
time it's in that that sealer the edge
sealer<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> they<00:01:45.390> put<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
sealer that they put on there now this

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.039

thing<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.939> usually<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.630> line<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
thing what we usually do is we line it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.469 
thing what we usually do is we line it
up<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.320> good<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.530> possible<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.149> very

up as good as possible and it's not very

up as good as possible and it's not very

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
precise and if we are off just a bit and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.100 
precise and if we are off just a bit and
we<00:01:54.659> push<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.079> skin<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:56.149> here<00:01:57.149> once<00:01:57.899> we've

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
we push this skin up here once we've

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.539 
we push this skin up here once we've
pushed<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> point<00:01:59.159> where<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
pushed it up to the point where it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.039 
pushed it up to the point where it's
starting<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.030> touch<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.810> what's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
starting to touch and we see what's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.690 
starting to touch and we see what's
going<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:02.240> even<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.540> haven't<00:02:03.810> bent<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.490> top

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
going on even if we haven't bent the top

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.719 
going on even if we haven't bent the top
metal<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:07.049> skin<00:02:07.439> enough<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.550> make

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
metal the skin enough to really make

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
metal the skin enough to really make
that<00:02:08.910> much<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.390> difference<00:02:09.780> we've<00:02:10.289> caused<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
that much of a difference we've caused a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.250 
that much of a difference we've caused a
huge<00:02:11.039> problem<00:02:11.280> why<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:11.970> metal<00:02:12.780> moves<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
huge problem why because metal moves and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.710 
huge problem why because metal moves and
only<00:02:13.500> knee

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
only knee

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.770 
only knee
fashion<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> digital<00:02:15.040> fashion

fashion and not in the digital fashion

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.270

so<00:02:16.780> when<00:02:16.930> we<00:02:17.080> come<00:02:17.320> here<00:02:17.620> if<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:17.950> has<00:02:18.130> already

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
so when we come here if this has already

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.980 
so when we come here if this has already
been<00:02:18.550> up<00:02:18.790> when<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.180> come<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
been up when we come right here to the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.840 
been up when we come right here to the
right<00:02:20.020> spot<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.770> adjust<00:02:21.280> with<00:02:21.700> our

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
right spot we adjust with our

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.510 
right spot we adjust with our
screwdriver<00:02:22.360> when<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.200> knock<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.650> up<00:02:23.980> this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
screwdriver when we knock this up this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.060 
screwdriver when we knock this up this
metal<00:02:24.910> has<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.360> move<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.750> bit<00:02:25.930> also<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.680> we're

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
metal has to move a bit also and we're

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.980 
metal has to move a bit also and we're
going<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> create<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.580> hot<00:02:27.790> spot<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.780> this

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
going to create a hot spot so this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.640 
going to create a hot spot so this
method<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.640> imprecise<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:32.110> has<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.440> be

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
method is imprecise and there has to be

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.120 
method is imprecise and there has to be
something<00:02:33.190> better<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.470> enter<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.730> edge<00:02:37.180> Jack

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
something better so enter the edge Jack

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.640 
something better so enter the edge Jack
this<00:02:39.130> thing<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.730> off<00:02:39.900> now<00:02:40.900> whenever<00:02:41.410> we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
this thing is so off now whenever we

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.500 
this thing is so off now whenever we
whenever<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.490> encounter<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.910> dent<00:02:43.180> that's<00:02:43.330> on

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
whenever we encounter a dent that's on

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.680 
whenever we encounter a dent that's on
an<00:02:43.630> edge<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.080> scene<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:45.310> can<00:02:45.520> use<00:02:45.820> our<00:02:46.450> mini

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
an edge or a scene we can use our mini

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.660 
an edge or a scene we can use our mini
lifters<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.320> they<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.010> ton<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.430> power

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
lifters that they have a ton of power

issue<00:02:51.910> like<00:02:52.240> this<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.709> gently<00:02:53.950> lift

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
issue like this and we can gently lift

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.000 
issue like this and we can gently lift
these<00:02:54.459> loads<00:02:54.730> out<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.380> what<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.440> do<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.830> use<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
these loads out now what I do is I use a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.310 
these loads out now what I do is I use a
sharp<00:02:57.490> tip<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.390> interchangeable<00:02:59.140> tip

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
sharp tip on this interchangeable tip

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.100 
sharp tip on this interchangeable tip
edge<00:02:59.650> jack<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:01.090> gives<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.720> lot<00:03:02.080> of

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
edge jack and that gives a lot of

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.590 
edge jack and that gives a lot of
precision<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> toilet<00:03:03.700> when<00:03:04.480> you're

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
precision to the toilet when you're

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.960 
precision to the toilet when you're
pushing<00:03:04.840> up<00:03:05.200> these<00:03:05.470> double<00:03:05.920> skins<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.730> double

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
pushing up these double skins the double

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.880 
pushing up these double skins the double
skin<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.270> gonna<00:03:07.360> deaden<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.990> little<00:03:08.230> bit<00:03:08.470> so

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
skin is gonna deaden it a little bit so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.800 
skin is gonna deaden it a little bit so
whenever<00:03:09.640> you're<00:03:09.910> pushing<00:03:10.270> on<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.510> double

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
whenever you're pushing on that double

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.810 
whenever you're pushing on that double
skin<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.410> need<00:03:11.560> something<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.100> sharp<00:03:12.550> and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
skin you need something really sharp and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.150 
skin you need something really sharp and
you'll<00:03:13.330> actually<00:03:13.510> see<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.200> skin<00:03:14.590> moving<00:03:14.890> a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
you'll actually see the skin moving a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.080 
you'll actually see the skin moving a
little<00:03:15.340> bit<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:16.200> before<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.350> actually<00:03:18.090> do

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
little bit and before you actually do

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.940 
little bit and before you actually do
any<00:03:19.300> damage<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.840> viewing<00:03:20.110> window<00:03:20.230> here

any damage in the viewing window here

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.800 
any damage in the viewing window here
allows<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.820> see<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:22.600> you're<00:03:22.780> doing

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
allows you to see what you're doing

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.590 
allows you to see what you're doing
better<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.650> again<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.910> can<00:03:25.030> see<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.330> skin

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
better and again you can see the skin

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.050 
better and again you can see the skin
moving<00:03:25.840> as<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.800> can<00:03:27.190> with<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.459> as<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.850> can
