forwards and obviously as you're

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.940 
forwards and obviously as you're
cornering<00:01:19.259> you're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> feel<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
cornering you're going to feel the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
cornering you're going to feel the
forces<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.490> gravity<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.240> leaning<00:01:21.780> into

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
forces of gravity as you're leaning into

those<00:01:22.259> corners<00:01:22.770> from<00:01:23.670> elevation<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.659> sway<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
those corners from elevation to sway to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
those corners from elevation to sway to
pitch<00:01:25.560> backwards<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.189> forward<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> moves

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
pitch backwards and forward so it moves

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:27.540 
pitch backwards and forward so it moves
in

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
in

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.820 
in
in<00:01:27.670> every<00:01:28.000> conceivable<00:01:28.450> direction<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.530> they

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
in every conceivable direction and they

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.560 
in every conceivable direction and they
were<00:01:29.890> important<00:01:30.280> inputs<00:01:30.580> because<00:01:30.970> for<00:01:31.510> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
were important inputs because for the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.930 
were important inputs because for the
driver<00:01:32.040> they're<00:01:33.040> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.430> meet<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.760> know

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
driver they're going to meet to know

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.210 
driver they're going to meet to know
what<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> attraction<00:01:35.170> levels<00:01:35.620> are<00:01:35.770> feeling

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
what the attraction levels are feeling

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.700 
what the attraction levels are feeling
like<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.820> this<00:01:37.150> is<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.480> element<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:37.930> only

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
like so this is the element that only

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.740 
like so this is the element that only
emotion<00:01:39.040> system<00:01:39.490> can<00:01:39.670> actually<00:01:40.090> give<00:01:40.330> back<00:01:40.510> to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
emotion system can actually give back to

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.830 
emotion system can actually give back to
the<00:01:40.870> yard<00:01:41.050> driver<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.970> motion<00:01:43.360> system<00:01:43.720> is

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
the yard driver the motion system is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.530 
the yard driver the motion system is
more<00:01:44.080> than<00:01:44.230> just<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.560> wild<00:01:44.830> ride<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:46.000> designed

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
more than just a wild ride it's designed

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.660 
more than just a wild ride it's designed
to<00:01:46.690> give<00:01:46.870> feedbacks<00:01:47.410> so<00:01:47.560> similar<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.370> real

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
to give feedbacks so similar to a real

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.460 
to give feedbacks so similar to a real
race<00:01:48.940> car<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.540> it's<00:01:49.870> actually<00:01:50.170> become<00:01:50.260> a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
race car that it's actually become a

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.470 
race car that it's actually become a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.570 

more<00:03:50.230> like<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> job<00:03:50.860> title<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.550> apply

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.720 
and the bumps a clot realistic medic
before<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.510> around<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.960> stuff<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.730> really

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.439 

I<00:04:22.410> think<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.919> might<00:04:23.130> screw<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.730> us<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.090> here<00:04:24.300> any

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
I think I might screw of us in here any

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.620 
I think I might screw of us in here any
