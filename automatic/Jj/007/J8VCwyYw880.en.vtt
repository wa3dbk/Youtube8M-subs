00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.540
 elegance is not fashionable 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.790
 passenger has more to do with pieces 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.349
 classic and quality that's why today we're going 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.050
 to know three places in the city ​​of 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.769
 Mexico where they sell clothing and accessories 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.769
 like those before 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 towards the northwest of the center 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.590
 historic in front of the blanquita theater 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.630
 we found the one to wer and to paris which 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.020
 is the fundamental difference between a 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.180
 disposable cap and one that yes 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.890
 be solid and that lasts a long time that's a 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.830
 My myth is that you come and ask me 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.620
 I want a good reinforced umbrella that 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.500
 not decomposed is not it the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.809
 umbrella that we sell here is 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.170
 they decompose like everything but they have 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.239
 repair what they do not have 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.369
 they sell on the street and what are the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.229
 most beautiful models the most classic are 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.540

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.759
 will always have repair 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.000
 It will always be more reliable than a 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.180
 short umbrella and much more solid 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.210
 and to protect you exclusively from the sun 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.190
 there are also umbrellas and these others are 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 very flirtatious but are designed to 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.340
 be part of a costume or a 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.340
 quinceanera attire 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.470
 the paraguarí to paris is also sharpener 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.290
 already and they sell great diversity of objects 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 for gift for example combs of 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.900
 aluminum purses and leather wallets 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.010
 keyrings corkscrew shaving brushes 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.470
 dominoes and batons you have 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.110
 that bringing a good umbrella influences the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.980
 elegance in the poise and in the attire of 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.560

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 do not 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.290
 another classic of the historic center start 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.440

 disused for several decades but that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.970
 lately he's coming back among the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.460
 young chileans 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.740
 bowler hat 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.950
 what comes here to be different from the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.130
 hats is the type of ironing that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.470
 has the brim of the hat what is going to 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.860
 to do here is to iron that hat 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.810
 wool felt with a damp cloth and what 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.060
 little bit that goes out we're going to iron it with 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.240

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.990
 here in front to soften felt 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.560
 and that it is soft and firm we are going to give
