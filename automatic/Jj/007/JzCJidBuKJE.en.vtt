00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
without further ado I shall turn the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.180 
without further ado I shall turn the
camera<00:00:12.630> towards<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> screen<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.740> show<00:00:14.130> you

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
what we've been up to okay so there's a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.529 
what we've been up to okay so there's a
reason<00:00:17.100> why<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> clay<00:00:17.609> Soldiers<00:00:17.970> project<00:00:18.390> is

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
reason why the clay Soldiers project is

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.779 
reason why the clay Soldiers project is
pretty<00:00:19.320> damn<00:00:19.590> late<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.100> why<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.730> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
pretty damn late and why it's going to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.300 
pretty damn late and why it's going to
be<00:00:20.939> kind<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.480> delayed<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> tiny<00:00:22.830> bit<00:00:22.980> more

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
be kind of delayed just a tiny bit more

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300 
be kind of delayed just a tiny bit more
is<00:00:23.550> because<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.470> turn<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> camera

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
is because if I just turn the camera

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
is because if I just turn the camera
here<00:00:26.490> onto<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:27.090> five<00:00:27.720> pillars<00:00:27.990> bed<00:00:29.179> I'm<00:00:30.179> gonna

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
here onto my five pillars bed I'm gonna

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.940 
here onto my five pillars bed I'm gonna
turn<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> camera<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.260> sec<00:00:32.270> um<00:00:33.290> yeah<00:00:34.290> that's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.549 
dead I'm getting someone to come repair
it<00:00:58.500> today<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.760> we're<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.570> sure<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it today but we're not sure that is

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.700 
it today but we're not sure that is
actually<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.489> fix<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> problem<00:01:03.270> because

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
actually gonna fix the problem because

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.250 
actually gonna fix the problem because
has<00:01:04.710> no<00:01:04.949> power<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.610> therefore<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.659> don't

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
has no power so therefore I don't

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
has no power so therefore I don't
actually<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> problem<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
actually know what the problem is but I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
actually know what the problem is but I
believe<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> power<00:01:09.960> supply<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
believe it is the power supply so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149 
believe it is the power supply so
hopefully<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.450> repair<00:01:12.810> costs<00:01:13.320> won't<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.950> too

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
hopefully the repair costs won't be too

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.380 
hopefully the repair costs won't be too
pricey<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.409> hey<00:01:16.409> there's<00:01:17.369> only<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.030> much<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
pricey but hey there's only so much I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.440 
pricey but hey there's only so much I
can<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:20.040> worse<00:01:20.369> comes<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> worse<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.270> can

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
because it's there's not much power need

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.210 
because it's there's not much power need
it<00:03:57.960> because<00:03:58.110> all<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> powers<00:03:58.890> coming<00:03:59.010> from

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
can't really run Vegas that very well

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.590 
can't really run Vegas that very well
because<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.210> massive<00:04:06.210> program<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.370> my<00:04:09.120> pc

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
because it is a massive program so my pc

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.830
