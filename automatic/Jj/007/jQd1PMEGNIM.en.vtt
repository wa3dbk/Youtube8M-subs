forward into it and so I want you to
look<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> couple<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.300> things<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
look at a couple of things here that I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.490 
look at a couple of things here that I
think<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.800> important<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.610> shot<00:00:42.500> number

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
think are important on this shot number

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
think are important on this shot number
one<00:00:43.649> too<00:00:44.309> often<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.510> players

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
one too often what I see is when players

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
one too often what I see is when players
go<00:00:46.140> over<00:00:46.910> for<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.120> shot<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.170> they

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
go over for this shot is that when they

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.060 
go over for this shot is that when they
plant<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.410> their<00:00:52.620> upper

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
plant here is that they have their upper

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.510 
plant here is that they have their upper
body<00:00:53.340> weight<00:00:53.760> too<00:00:54.600> far<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.170> front<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
body weight too far in front and that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
body weight too far in front and that
even<00:00:56.879> though<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> play<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> shot<00:00:57.989> off<00:00:58.260> off

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
even though you play this shot off off

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
even though you play this shot off off
your<00:00:58.980> back<00:00:59.190> foot<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.760> might<00:01:00.000> play<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> might

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
your back foot you might play it might

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.470 
your back foot you might play it might
play<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> good<00:01:01.350> shot<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.969> setup<00:01:03.329> position

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
play a good shot but the setup position

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
play a good shot but the setup position
is<00:01:03.840> such<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.489> upper

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is such as that your is that your upper

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600 
is such as that your is that your upper
body<00:01:05.939> weight<00:01:06.330> carries<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.290> past<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.040> shot<00:01:08.310> as

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
body weight carries you past the shot as

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
body weight carries you past the shot as
you<00:01:08.640> hit<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.869> end<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.040> here

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you hit it and you end up out in here

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
you hit it and you end up out in here
and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.180> problem<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.320> hit

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and the problem is is you can still hit

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.310 
and the problem is is you can still hit
a<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.710> shot<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.080> give<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
a good shot and if you do if you give a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
a good shot and if you do if you give a
lot<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> pace<00:01:16.890> back<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.460> opponent<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
lot of pace back to your opponent and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.289 
lot of pace back to your opponent and
you<00:01:18.570> end<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:19.140> after<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> shot<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:21.000> you've

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
