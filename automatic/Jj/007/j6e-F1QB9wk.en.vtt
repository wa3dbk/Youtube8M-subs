00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.480
 with the sentence ready 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.280
 now let's worry about solving the pipes of said phase 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.570
 and so leave yellow phase all complete 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.729
 start as here 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.179
 the hot move will hold three steps I dream 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.179
 and he is very quiet he also decorates 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.400
 just came 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.710
 tenth 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.699
 day I only came 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.789
 Virginia 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.789
 gs 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.269
 just p 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.220
 free 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 Yes you can 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.230
 just came 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
 kings villa 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.140
 bs 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 and with this movement we will be able to solve 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060
 the phase now 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.840
 when we finish the thing in some cases the cube will not total 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.700
 like this 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.010
 where you need to apply the sine only once so that the yellow that all 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.620
 complete 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 we can summarize the scarcity of space 4 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.109
 and we will differentiate them according to the number of songs 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.750
 the tide those who will be ready to enter 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 then the first case 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.950
 This is where all the songs have already appeared ready so I ask the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 Next word step without doing anything 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.810
 another case 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.010
 this one 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.940
 at where 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.990
 Here we have kroes 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.720
 in relation to the corners only one 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.180
 is ready 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.740
 this one here 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.660
 two cases are only ready 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 in the latter is never ready 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.259
 pre-salt 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.310
 How are you with three cars ready 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.540
 and the two layers are already ready that it is important to note this 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.150
 and your body 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.300
 with the pieces changed in the same way that in the past ended 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.500
 reason to have disassembled and you pay nothing so if some time 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.360
 meet 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 three cars just ready 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.370
 I recommend that says very little again we saw prepare and do again 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.150
 so come on 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.750
 this first case 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.950
 we should always put 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.950
 this yellow card the only one that is ready 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.519
 on the left and front side here the granddaughter 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.739
 you here or here you do not have to be here 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.899
 is one of them 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:18.879
 only 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.520
 it rains indira 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.309
 tenth 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.399
 he turns from the 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.319
 and now we have a corner and again 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.669
 what was left of teaching 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.929
 we bring it back to the right place 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:32.919
 on here 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.919
 and we apply this again 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.449
 bs 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.120
 I only came pine 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.230
 turn around 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.409
 A.D 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.289
 we completed the high tide 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.229
 in this other case here that has two fields 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.429
 regardless of where the corners are, it may be that there is a corner here 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.999
 and another here 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.120
 no matter if it's 2 the rule will always be the same 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.139
 who returns 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.399
 you have to leave a high tide 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:04.489
 in this position facing you and the left side of the cab 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.549
 then or here it does not fit here it does not fit and it does not fit here 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.359
 have to stay here 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.229
 and so you can apply the sound 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.049
 climbs up 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.829
 A.D 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.720
 just come 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.679
 virgilio am tc 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.229
 and now we have one again 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.399
 right position for a singer here 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:26.869
 We can apply the scoresheet 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:27.719
 climbs up 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.669
 lira 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:29.649
 s 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.309
 lira just came 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.629
 the guerrilla 10 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.779
 one again 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.779
 I put it here 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:38.949
 elections 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.599
 climbs up 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.549
 ps 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.060
 day it rains 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.309
 delusion 10 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.279
 we also complete human here 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.569
 in the latter case 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.769
 It's a little different because 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.870
 the yellow has to be here in this case fierce to the phase of the left 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.799
 so much so if it is yes 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.069
 or so because in both ways has a marvel 3 that then romps 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.539
 solberg 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:06.499
 lira 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.169
 tenth 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.349
 Only Robinho VirgÃ­lio 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.419
 I have a couple now 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.769
 put in the right position 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.319
 only 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.250
 A.D 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.049
 clear only time 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.270
 direct to 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.270
 and thus complete every major force 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.379
 to make it easier to remember where the right position for each case 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.690
 it's just you remember 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.990
 that it is always important that this committee, which is on the corner above 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
 so when there is only one corner 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.009
 is the top phase of cubism 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.480
 with 37 years 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.789
 is the front face of the same cube 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.180
 and when you have no candidate before 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.419
 is the face of the left in that same cube
