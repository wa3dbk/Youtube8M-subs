00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.290
 as a brisk game carries already 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 heard loud and clear 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.900
 you can win gehrys with yes mine 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.910
 friends like that and after the contest 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.630
 I will be a game of chance that is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.250
 long ago accepted 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.250
 who does not win now has 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 the chance of a copy of gizmo 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.830
 those parents on mine 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 Steam account and present to him 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.019
 personally against the spot copy 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.809
 soup or people alright 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.000
 and that no one here can say I 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.440
 would cheat or somehow never 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 could accuse 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 you 're happy playing ideas and and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 that's no shit anyway you get 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 I do not agree or I am a very 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 honest man in this act in this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.949
 Matter immensely when I say it wins 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.360
 one by luck then wins it is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.559
 also one by luck but there some 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 People still do not seem to be 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.030
 Believe, why I always have something 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.590
 cool thinks about how to do more than how to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.379
 One hundred percent believe you can 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.680
 Here again this school thing where ever 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.560
 It's a bit moving here and me 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.810
 guess what is the age was beautiful 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 and a really good idea of ​​me totally 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 heaven but we are just awesome 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 these things are here when they explode 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.299
 field scanty down and behind this 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.580
 there was no wall behind this part 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.290
 wall on this is a number so 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 this metal piece behind this one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.740
 hide number and as soon as the things 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.090
 came down here as a fall or 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 to be destroyed the thing falls down 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.310
 and you can see the number on the wall like that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 the number I usually do with the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.250
 point that means I go for example 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.079
 the 1 1 to 5000 or so as an example 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.820
 the number is the user means 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.990
 assumed that are now what next 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.310
 the number is back 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.159
 suppose it is now the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.729
 for example, 500 clicks achieved 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.460
 For example, there are 500 clicks 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.229
 reached and from there which profit from there 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.180
 which no resolution video and make 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.799
 So the winner is the one who does that 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.280
 has written last comment 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.290
 won 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.000
 it can be that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.160
 win already at the 100 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.259
 call or maybe 800 that ends 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.679
 Only I know and the number is here 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.650
 behind 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.030
 and that nobody really knows better 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 No one can say that I say 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.390
 Mold if I wave it to you 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 Creating the one with a date is therefore one 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.530
 Can I see what I have saved 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.030
 I can show you that, too 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.980
 and if the resolution will come 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.450
 I just this map that I will here 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.489
 then I'll open that thing 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.930
 open and then show who 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.150
 has won that is accepted the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.400
 1000 clicks are achieved as an example 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.109
 It was the 1000 clicks I did 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.129
 I have ever set the goal and may I 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.900
 then said this comes this 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.670
 contest and the one of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.950
 last wrote a comment 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:50.639
 he did the funny thing like you did 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.470
 you see 26 end of 2014, it should be a solo 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.389
 De may have as many comments as 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.519
 could possibly separate by swimming 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:01.290
 just write all the time that they 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.659
 in the chat attack and did not 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.310
 somehow such a shit could otherwise yes 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.950
 that she might lose because 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.239
 youtube is totally disabled so 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.430
 but the study of them is played by the 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.430
 regulation of those who mean 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.729
 We like us, we make ourselves at the filter 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.620
 rey is nice and good but if it is 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.239
 Some people do not want to go flat 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.190
 but no matter so write anyway 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.989
 just attack and heathen the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.189
 could tech and high three billion times 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.560
 write in the comments 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.299
 the more comments you write 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.650
 you have more luck you can theoretically 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.790
 So you want me to have that one 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.739
 you have a bigger chance of winning 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.000
 theoretically because that can not be 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.560
 had been unaware that videos are 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.530
 clicked on the video 5000 times 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.569
 as an example first and exactly this 5000 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.069
 Clicks are behind the wall and you 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.329
 wrote the last comment 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.709
 So now decide comment 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.239
 written and I try more real 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.159
 always stay up to date 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.199
 So I always look over my 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.299
 Handy or man pc depending on how I am 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.189
 time I have on the video and 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.959
 when the number is reached the 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.129
 behind, people are happy 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.079
 Write comments 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:07.379
 And here is the world as I said 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:10.169
 was on 20 02 2014 at 15 o'clock 40 and 22 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.939
 Seconds you see yes and there can 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.680
 nobody say against again 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.530
 cheated or something in the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.180
 kind or somehow anyone wins 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.219
 is the case modding it not 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.419
 has earned or so so the one of 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.450
 wins here either has that way 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.610
 much effort given 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.410
 just had good luck i wish 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.580
 Good luck to you all in the sweepstakes 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.200
 Everyone can join in, as I said 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.760
 just write in tech and haydn and 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.290
 even if we did not win here 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.370
 There are still several contests 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.260
 Of course, I have one more 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.090
 version of gamespot which is natural 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.890
 will give away for you because something wants 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.650
 Me so that I can do it myself 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.140
 I make you surrender people so pure 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.400
 and until then they saw and let the 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.400
 begin comments
