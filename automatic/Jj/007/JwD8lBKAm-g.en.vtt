00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.450
 I took the audacity to come to

 interview why 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:48.210

 since I 'm prettier in short 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.219
 from the bottom up I think that the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 arteros like to show off a pretty babe 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.800
 on his motorcycle 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 this is so clear I agree 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.690
 with you totally agree with you and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.340
 is that it says that the ailerons love 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 show a pretty mom in her 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 motorcycle what seems like always a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 man has to exhibit to a good 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.000
 woman not necessarily a gardener 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.000
 necessarily 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.810
 but I also came because I said to 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.000
 the best and I find something I too 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.200
 miss an event commented and the girls 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.690

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.430
 how do you look 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.800
 there is a transformer 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.850
 well this time doing what I 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.549
 I'm making good decisions 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.500
 good good now tell me the truth is 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.270
 that the jugs love to exhibit 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.080
 more my dad I do not want to have problems 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.790
 your boyfriend here will not always win a 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.320
 kiss on the cheek I leave happy 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.670
 to my house in the bladder 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 If you are going to give it to me 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.490
 a greeting and a good appointment because he has 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.490
 saying 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.180
 so you can see but everything is everything 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 they lost home 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.830
 a little spin to create 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.830
 that is 100% natural 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.300
 says that they are the ones who are exhibiting their 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.300
 girlfriend on all those bikes 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.730
 you already have this beautiful prize and you 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 is the girl they have been with 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.260
 excellent because they say it has to be 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.590
 pretty girlfriend in which I accompanied him 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.980
 If the bike is for the girlfriend, she has to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.349
 be super better for the doubles so that 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.110
 people do not stay with a little spin 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:58.890
 for the camera this boludo happy not 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.890
 Clear 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.370
 Of course we are going to continue 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.370
 looking for more 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.760
 the environment is very good is doing 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.950
 much heat more than anything with the sack 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.950
 But your not clear on environment 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.750
 it's the best, the best, I came because 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.370
 They told me there are a lot of more 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.460
 it's true 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.120
 each month 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.120
 my love 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.500

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.550
 them a little spin to see everything 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:50.060

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.320

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.320
 he could not come he missed it 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.000

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.250
