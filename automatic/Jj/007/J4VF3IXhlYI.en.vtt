00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello very good to all how are you 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.460
 I'm strict and today I'm 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.099
 here to bring you and as you already know 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.200
 new competitive analysis on a 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.730
 pokémon that at level is one of the 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.890
 best mega evolutions that has 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.960
 brought now the sixth generation already does 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.460
 enough of a few months one of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.230
 The best mega-volution is at the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.210
 true in the competitive pokemon in the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.890
 competitive field that is going to be mega 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.260
 venus as you can see by the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.150
 images good you know that before 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.489
 talk about the set the movements the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.559
 share of them nature how will you use 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.899
 this pokemon I usually talk about 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.660
 skill that has its sets and its stats 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.690
 base and the combination of types well the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.910
 combination of types is poison plant 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.930
 It would be a pretty combination 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.300
 unfortunate if not for the skill 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.430
 what does it have that is evo in the combination 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.350
 poison plant has four weaknesses 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.730
 however, thanks to his ability to 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.920
 mega evolution you know mega goes on 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.960
 a south that is evo is going to make this 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.780
 Pokemon has only two weaknesses 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.550
 that are going to be psychic and flying which 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.299
 Well, the truth is going to be pretty good 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.350
 since the psychic type almost do not see it 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.479
 removing me 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.100
 a little very competitive and the kind 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.930
 flying yes it is more seen especially 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.330
 you know flame doorway I think it 's 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.250
 long flame is the second or third 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.080
 pokemon most used right now do not see 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.610
 just so such a frame the truth is 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.600
 that is going to be a very good counter for 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.280
 mega belu south but we are removing from 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.009
 true to heel flame ya mega hunt 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.530
 very few things can stop in their tracks 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.780
 this pokemon because it's very bulqize a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 very good tank as we can see by 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.130
 your stats will have for the part of the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.520
 defense by the boom part is going to have 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.860
 80 of life 123 of defense and 120 of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.080
 special defense only a few stats very 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.170
 defensively good is going to give us a 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.229
 average of 106 110 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.240
 Let's go great is a very bulke pokémon 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.800
 but on the offensive side the truth is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.690
 that neither is nothing short man 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 it's normal since it's a mega evolution 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.860
 is a pokémon with very good stats like 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.380
 we can see has 100 base attack that 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.120
 it's not bad 122 special attack 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.120
 which is a very high special attack very 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.709
 good and 80 speed that to be a 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.840
 pokémon bulk and as I'm going 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.860
 advancing the set that I'm going to give you is going to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.660
 be 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.060
 to be a pokémon tank a pokémon 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.800
 that will withstand 80 speed hits 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 it's very good it's a pretty speed 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.870
 high and good then let's move on to what 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.170
 is the move set and the council 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.760
 what a good surf menu stands out for being a 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 Very tough pokémon has a bulk 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.270
 very high as I told you a great 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.460
 special attack you know your attack 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.680
 special is very good and only has two 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.900
 weaknesses as I already told you about flying and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.310
 psychic mega venus a is presented as 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.630
 a pokémon very to have account in the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.780
 competitive field of the sixth 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.490
 generation is being worth the number 14 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.440
 as for use not see yuste refers 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.050
 this is a fact that I tell you is the inside 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.730
 of the 600 and peak pokemon that there is in 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.700
 that has been not seeing just competitive 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.010
 is number 14 in terms of use and good 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.660
 because the mega venus is one of the best 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 tanks of the entire sixth generation the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.370
 truth is that the ability to resist 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.440
 blows this burns this pokemon is very 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.270
 very high well as we can see the musel 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.940
 will carry nador ace giga drained 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.640
 mud pump and synthesis and as the council 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.200
 Also crash, as you recommend to say 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.090
 that you also have care about everything 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.360
 when you fight against them or when 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.300
 go to arm 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.910
 your own mega venus ur that some 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.670
 they often put an earthquake on it to get rid of 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.230
 gea tran because they last title is another of 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.720
 the pokemon that blocks him pretty well 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.820
 or sets with sleeping pills remember that it is 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.640
 a pokémon with 80 base speed that 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.830
 It's not bad at all and you can put it 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.930
 soporific so nothing advice 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.080
 it is simply that you have in mind that 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.610
 apart from the set that I am giving you 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.160
 you will also find venga danced 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.959
 with earthquake and its soporific and 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.640
 Well what I told you before him 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.320
 musel the skill is going to be sebum the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.910
 object is going to be the venus right now 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.980
 you know the mega stone to be able 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.900
 evolve and good with a ship 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.520
 excellent only two weaknesses the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.650
 ability to heal and an attack 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.420
 special for post to be able to follow 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.250
 having an offensive presence venus ur 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.560
 we are presented with this tank set 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.930
 special giga drained to hit very 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.880
 hard and regenerate life coaches for 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.370
 perform this and to regenerate even more 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.470
 life pump mud is to hit with this 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.990
 to the pokemon type plant shape 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.150
 Effective super effective because as you know 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.040
 the plant type pokemones are going to be 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.650
 immune to draining dora's were going to resist 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.389
 very good the giant 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.880
 and good synthesis is to regenerate life 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.069
 and facilitate the stress as it could be 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.960
 seeing now by the combination of 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.030
 attacks three of them are going to do that 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.430
 regenerate life giga drained synthesis and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.470
 drained hours since a cause of the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.970
 mega stone we will not have remains 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.949
 then for generating very lives 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.349
 important for mega see a south is a 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.389
 very versatile pokémon very good going to 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.550
 hit very hard with both mud pump 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.440
 how drained freezes will stick with 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.449
 ie drained hours for this will ar 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.430
 with drained hours and very very synthesis 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.360
 well and the truth is that it is a pokémon 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.849
 which is very complicated to pull away 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.610
 for some few who do sing to him 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.949
 They have quite good as can be heel 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.349
 flame as it can also be mega the 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.780
 hunt or how could it be hitler in 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.880
 some cases and good what you already 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.370
 I commented good the cast of the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.740
 nature will be serene - attack more 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.990
 special attack forgiveness less attack more 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.319
 special defense in this case and the sets 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.289
 they will go 252 in life 160 in defense 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.340
 special and 96 in speed is a cast 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.480
 what 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.610
 that the truth is that it's pretty good 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.280
 takes enough speed to be 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.810
 faster than some three and good the 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.880
 rest then goes mostly to album and good 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.500
 Well, the advice that I am going to give you 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.150
 about the use of mega venus uros if 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.530
 you want to put a southern menu in your 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.720
 team that I the truth is that I 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.639
 I recommend it is a very good pokémon and 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.290
 well then since his two 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.510
 weaknesses are the psychic type and the 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.389
 Flying guy is not a bad idea to have a 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.400
 hit run or a washing machine mouse maybe better 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.950
 have turan on your team because with 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.930
 hit land we will resist all the 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.540
 blows whether psychic and flying type 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.070
 we will resist it very well and they will 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.470
 form between them as a defensive duo 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.810
 pretty good so nothing this has been 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.550
 all really are if you liked them 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.710
 has been useful for real x subscribe 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.169
 it helps a lot and little more 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.700
 the question that I am going to leave you is if you 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.229
 have you ever met with this 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.300
 mega by lu south in competitive that the 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.729
 Actually , I think so and I 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.280
 comment if it has been complicated 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.080
 of pulling or eyes has carried 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.210
 It has been a very, very complicated Pokémon 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.990
 throw down and nothing then little more than 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.820
 true 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.890
 is a useful result you liked to give 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.080
 when you subscribe you have gone a lot and 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.760
 good of course if you see something wrong in 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.350
 this strategy you have your own 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.240
 strategy or do you think that you can 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.820
 improve put in the comments without 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.140
 problem in participating so nothing of 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.100
 true thank you very much for watching the video and 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.100
 come up soon
