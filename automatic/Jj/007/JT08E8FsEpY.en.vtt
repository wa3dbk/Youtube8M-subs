put the abstract works together and I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.810 
put the abstract works together and I
put<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:54.240> pop<00:02:54.510> works<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.040> little<00:02:56.340> different

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
put the pop works in a little different

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.920 
put the pop works in a little different
type<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.720> set<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.050> there<00:02:59.180> so<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
type of set in there so it's a you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.910 
type of set in there so it's a you
develop<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.680> feel<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:03.180> not<00:03:03.420> something

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
develop a feel it's not something

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.150 
develop a feel it's not something
formulated<00:03:04.920> it's<00:03:05.550> more<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.150> feel<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.890> if

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
formulated it's more of a feel and if

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.750 
formulated it's more of a feel and if
you<00:03:08.340> feel<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> certain<00:03:09.210> way<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:11.100> it's<00:03:11.520> also

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
you feel a certain way and it's also

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.630 
you feel a certain way and it's also
trial<00:03:12.240> narrow<00:03:12.770> so<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.920> may<00:03:14.070> hang<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.340> painting

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
trial narrow so you may hang a painting

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.100 
trial narrow so you may hang a painting
and<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> couple<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.480> days<00:03:15.600> later<00:03:15.900> you

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and then a couple of days later you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.410 
and then a couple of days later you
might<00:03:16.290> say<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.430> know<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.580> think<00:03:17.730> something<00:03:18.180> if

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
might say you know I think something if

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.420 
might say you know I think something if
so-and-so<00:03:18.630> would<00:03:19.140> work<00:03:19.350> better<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:20.100> than

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
so-and-so would work better there than

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:43.800 
so-and-so would work better there than
what<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.450> her<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.690> got<00:03:22.080> now

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.870
