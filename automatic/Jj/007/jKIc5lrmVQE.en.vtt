meat boy with that of the impossible
game<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.760> understands<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.960> very

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
game it understands that it's a very

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.920 
game it understands that it's a very
difficult<00:00:19.609> tricky<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.789> maneuver<00:00:20.910> world<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
difficult tricky to maneuver world and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.620 
difficult tricky to maneuver world and
so<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.529> has<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.340> fast-paced<00:00:24.119> gameplay

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so it has a very fast-paced gameplay

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
so it has a very fast-paced gameplay
that<00:00:25.140> allows<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.529> pick<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.039> right<00:00:26.220> where

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that allows you to pick up right where

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
that allows you to pick up right where
you<00:00:26.369> left<00:00:26.460> off<00:00:26.849> whenever<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.449> end<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.779> dying

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
you left off whenever you end up dying

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.560 
you left off whenever you end up dying
or<00:00:28.500> getting<00:00:28.529> killed<00:00:29.189> by<00:00:29.310> spikes<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:29.939> anything

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
or getting killed by spikes or anything

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
or getting killed by spikes or anything
like<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.050> instead<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.590> talking<00:00:31.830> more<00:00:32.099> I'm

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
like that so instead of talking more I'm

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.440 
like that so instead of talking more I'm
gonna<00:00:32.520> play<00:00:32.790> through<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> level<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.390> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
gonna play through a level that I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.760 
gonna play through a level that I
already<00:00:33.660> played<00:00:33.930> through<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> first

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
already played through in the first

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
already played through in the first
world<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
world and you can see what one of the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.869 
world and you can see what one of the
basic<00:00:37.440> levels<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.280> structured

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
basic levels it's like what structured

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.430 
basic levels it's like what structured
has<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.450> things<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> avoid<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
has what things you have to avoid and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
has what things you have to avoid and
then<00:00:40.829> I'll<00:00:40.950> play<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.489> level<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.149> haven't

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
then I'll play the level that I haven't

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
then I'll play the level that I haven't
played<00:00:42.750> before<00:00:42.870> attempt<00:00:43.620> number<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
played before attempt number one and you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
played before attempt number one and you
can<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.270> long<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.289> complete

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
can see how long it can take to complete

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
can see how long it can take to complete
a<00:00:46.800> level<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> real<00:00:48.210> world

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
a level what it's like in the real world

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
a level what it's like in the real world

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
okay so I'm just going to pick a level

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.760 
okay so I'm just going to pick a level
at<00:00:50.100> random<00:00:50.460> why<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.480> okay<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
at random why not we do this one okay so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.380 
at random why not we do this one okay so
you<00:00:52.860> start<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> cute<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.000> blob

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you start off as this cute little blob

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.420 
you start off as this cute little blob
which<00:00:54.660> might<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.050> 14<00:00:55.559> pixels<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> might<00:00:56.309> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
which might be 14 pixels that might be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
which might be 14 pixels that might be
why<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.640> optical<00:00:57.390> 14<00:00:57.719> pixels<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.440> just

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
why this optical 14 pixels and you just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
why this optical 14 pixels and you just
have<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> navigate<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> end<00:00:59.550> which<00:00:59.699> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
have to navigate to the end which you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
have to navigate to the end which you
might<00:00:59.910> have<00:00:59.969> seen<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.300> zoom<00:01:00.570> by<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.050> let's<00:01:01.379> try

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
might have seen a zoom by so let's try

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.600 
might have seen a zoom by so let's try
this<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:03.019> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.229> wall<00:01:04.650> jump<00:01:04.949> double<00:01:05.489> jump

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
this out you can wall jump double jump

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.630 
this out you can wall jump double jump
of<00:01:05.939> course<00:01:08.600> alright<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.369> idea

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of course alright so that's it the idea

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
of course alright so that's it the idea
is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.630> many<00:01:12.810> little

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is that you want to get as many little

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
is that you want to get as many little
dots<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.820> many<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> little

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
dots as you can as many of the little

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.620 
dots as you can as many of the little
coin<00:01:15.990> generators<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.299> also

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
coin generators as you can and you also

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
coin generators as you can and you also
want<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> free<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.350> many<00:01:19.590> friends<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.310> can

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
want to free as many friends as you can

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.300 
want to free as many friends as you can
in<00:01:20.759> order<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.360> three<00:01:21.630> stars<00:01:22.250> okay<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
in order to get all three stars okay so

in order to get all three stars okay so
that<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.549> pretty<00:01:23.640> fast<00:01:23.880> pretty<00:01:24.119> good

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
