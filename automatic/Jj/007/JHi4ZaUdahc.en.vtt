00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.940
 so proceed to the assembly of the generator 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:18.550
 what happens as I explained on 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.550
 previous video 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:37.340
 that is, here are two opposing 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 halves right now I will put the pulleys 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:51.440
 so well, that's already half put put 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.910
 and pulleys the only expense problem 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.840
 put the second cover because 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.710
 it magnetically is very strong 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.760
 here but accordingly when it is necessary very 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.760
 beat it gently 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.290
 well, and so the principle of the main assembly 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:32.140
 will finish 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:38.010
 Here is such a 300 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.010
 quite easy to rotate 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.220
 it seems to be correct polarity 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:06.390
 that is, turning one way one 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:12.800
 plus minus 5 minus occurs from the disk 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:21.150
 plus that is, in theory, it remains to be soldered 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:24.110
 belt here and look at turn it on 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.110
 already in work 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.400
 quite interesting and spent yesterday 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.090
 small such experiences were just 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.250
 I wonder what we can give here is the truth 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.050
 I fastened magnets to anyone 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.110
 special these here are the trick 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.880
 straight to the stove 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.160
 well, of course he was very far away 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.070
 induction for their own was significantly less 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.250
 what is it now I am getting a gap now 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.030
 between millimeter gap date discs 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.160
 between millimeter magnets about 6 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.000
 color wall thickness inside the pulley 4 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.570
 millimeter goes there by the millimeter eye 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.670
 here but it was much better naturally 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.160
 here they nevertheless showed literally 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.239
 with the hand it was possible to rotate that is 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.340
 showed up 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.900
 clearly recorded current clearly 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.090
 it was fixed voltage is small 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 Of course, here is but pleasure to achieve 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.739
 honestly i don't know thousands of turns 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.160
 drill there night but 3 thousand revolutions 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:37.110
 it turns out 0 1 volts without problems he 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.890
 almost 1 ampere of current ie try 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.930
 today drive one of the drives is just 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.129
 see what it turns out 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.579
 in one then I will gather and it will be possible 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:57.010
 hold more complete so to speak 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:59.019
 tests yet everyone here is as yet in 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:09.090
 This show is not bought 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:12.250
 small brushes to 1 for floors here here 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.620
 when will make it primitive 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:22.509
 brush holder put the brush here 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.180
 it will be possible to say more correctly 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:28.720
 shoot current more big out exactly 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.120
 area good contacts here because 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.580
 How do you look at the design of course 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.120
 ideally, the shafts also isolate 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.660
 electric bearing she can either 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.930
 let's say ceramics on stand up because 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.150
 volta itself is non-magnetic here but when 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.090
 current flow and residual large 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.010
 forces here naturally around the shaft 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.789
 magnetic field occurs which affects 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.180
 on the bearing 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.800
 that is how strong it is 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.380
 how big a problem is with this i 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.220
 I don't know for sure what they are but 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.580
 again as a solved problem it is not 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.580
 question
