00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.999 
I think they're called like tankinis so
would<00:01:22.939> be<00:01:22.999> like<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.149> suit<00:01:23.600> but<00:01:24.469> it's<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.710> bathing

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
would be like a suit but it's a bathing

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.230 
would be like a suit but it's a bathing
suit<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.219> then<00:01:25.310> there's<00:01:25.460> like<00:01:25.549> cutout<00:01:25.939> pieces

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240

with<00:01:26.689> ties<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.799> they<00:01:28.280> all<00:01:28.399> keep<00:01:28.549> handing<00:01:28.819> in

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
with ties and they all keep handing in

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.609 
with ties and they all keep handing in
briefcases<00:01:29.270> like<00:01:29.509> different<00:01:29.840> cases<00:01:30.020> when

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
briefcases like different cases when

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.410 
briefcases like different cases when
they<00:01:30.710> hand<00:01:30.890> them<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.009> him<00:01:31.159> he<00:01:31.429> shoots<00:01:32.090> at<00:01:32.240> them

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
they hand them to him he shoots at them

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.340 
they hand them to him he shoots at them
and<00:01:32.749> they<00:01:32.840> explode<00:01:33.490> shh<00:01:34.490> shh<00:01:34.600> shh

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
and they explode shh shh shh

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.349 
and they explode shh shh shh
like<00:01:36.560> all<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.189> his<00:01:37.310> like<00:01:37.490> great<00:01:37.729> hand<00:01:37.969> gestures

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
like all of his like great hand gestures

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.419 
like all of his like great hand gestures
that<00:01:38.569> the<00:01:39.259> pub<00:01:39.560> does<00:01:39.799> all<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.039> dive<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.219> then

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
that the pub does all the dive and then

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.669 
that the pub does all the dive and then
I<00:01:40.520> guess<00:01:40.670> if<00:01:40.789> there<00:01:40.909> had<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.060> be<00:01:41.149> music<00:01:41.689> during

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
I guess if there had to be music during

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:43.809 
I guess if there had to be music during
the<00:01:42.770> commercial<00:01:43.189> I'm<00:01:43.310> pretty<00:01:43.609> sure<00:01:43.700> there

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
the commercial I'm pretty sure there

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.730 
the commercial I'm pretty sure there
would<00:01:43.909> be<00:01:43.969> some<00:01:44.210> kind<00:01:44.359> of<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:44.719> like<00:01:45.469> theme

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
would be some kind of like like theme

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.370 
would be some kind of like like theme
music<00:01:45.859> from<00:01:46.219> a<00:01:46.280> blaxploitation<00:01:47.119> film<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.719> in
