00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.319
 all good health literally 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.750
 a few days ago 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:13.130
 I shot a video of these boots here 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.780
 told how and why I bought them 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.050
 the link to this video will be down in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.109
 description under this video and when i 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 posted the first video one of the viewers 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.900
 my channel said asked to sort of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 and asked was of interest see how 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.130
 These shoes look on foot That's why 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.350
 I shoot this video + I want to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.350
 share your first impressions 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 use of these shoes well what are we 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:52.579
 will say a very big plus 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.270
 this shoe is that it's light 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.359
 I compared it almost one to one with 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.239
 my sneakers 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.860
 plus after the shoes I'm for the string 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.470
 laced on poppy 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.960
 they practically 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.240
 fall on your leg tightly crimped 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.970
 ankle and comfort 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 improved plus that plus the fact that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.980
 lightweight boots 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.390
 walking them very comfortable outsole such 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.550
 springy measure and thanks to competent 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.950
 protector that's just such a process 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.190
 wanted to buy 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.970
 walking comfortable grip excellent in these 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.310
 I walked a little bit 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:53.280
 helped plant potatoes walked the earth 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.880
 that is, due to the fact that shallow 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.590
 small protectors like here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.979
 notches 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.880
 small as if a small ledge here 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.979
 these tread on the sole ground here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.920
 the only thing that is not stuffed 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.110
 stuffed a little on the heel 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.290
 but it's kind of natural I went by 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.320
 the raw earth sticks a little 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.950
 earth but uncritically that is going up to 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.950
 any stone to a tree or some 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.300
 curb at the ledges can be like this 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:36.510
 hit a few times and everything flies 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.680
 so it is convenient that as if from pluses 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.709
 and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.540
 of the benefits of something that is really not hot 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.560
 in these shoes because here it is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.560
 synthetically despite being here 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.720
 he seems to be missing interesting material 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.180
 the air again I did not go through the heat there 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.040
 20 30 degrees but I think that how would this 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.660
 there will be no deadly either 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.709
 critical of the minuses of the minus some 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.920
 I haven't found anything big yet 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.900
 the only drawback but how would for 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.560
 home use such here such 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.160
 shoe 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.849
 it 's not critical, but if I were 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.830
 shod them like a soldier like a soldier then 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.290
 anxiety when you need urgently 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:32.670
 shoes need to be these shoes 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:37.440
 need rush to tear them up about here 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.080
 this position then legs without problems 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.160
 vlazit shoes and again you need to lace up 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.840
 that is, if 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.060
 need emergency shoes on it goes away 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.030
 a little bit of time but again i'm using 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.110
 for the bull for the chores here 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.459
 these shoes are therefore in a hurry with me 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:02.040
 there is no knockout and as a result 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.959
 all as good this minus me not 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.720
 straining 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.209
 Well basically as it has changed 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.030
 it is not clear how to clean this one 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.739
 the fabric part that is she probably 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.299
 will eventually be overwritten and a little bit 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.430
 It will be like let light becomes 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.299
 because I take care as if trying 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.760
 forget Khimki 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:28.070
 but not only to care for shoes 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:32.460
 for example, I came home after winter 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.510
 helped dried rubbed cream pokryvil as 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.400
 would and they look quite like 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.710
 presentable but how would this part 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.960
 cream smear I will not of course because 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.229
 what 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.949
 pores will be forgotten and the fabric will not 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.360
 breathe 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.210
 but I think from the time she will 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.099
 will be erased a little bit here 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.849
 boiler but this is again not critical because 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.880
 that i use these shoes for myself for 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.380
 some work to do so 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.990
 aestheticism is not in the first place 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.539
 principle, how would it all thank you 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.539
 watched see you bye
