about that gun that with the suppressor

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.040 
about that gun that with the suppressor
it<00:02:31.660> was<00:02:31.780> fucking<00:02:32.350> awesome<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:34.050> definitely

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
it was fucking awesome it's definitely

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.320 
it was fucking awesome it's definitely
got<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> very<00:02:35.380> high<00:02:35.560> fire<00:02:35.890> rate<00:02:36.160> which<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:37.210> me

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
got a very high fire rate which for me

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.000 
got a very high fire rate which for me
in<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.570> game<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.930> very<00:02:37.990> good<00:02:38.380> because<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
in this game is very good because it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
in this game is very good because it
definitely<00:02:39.160> takes<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.820> lot<00:02:40.390> more<00:02:40.420> ammo<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.050> kill

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
definitely takes a lot more ammo to kill

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.020 
definitely takes a lot more ammo to kill
someone<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.830> black<00:02:42.040> ops<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.640> did<00:02:42.850> in

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
someone in black ops that it did in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.790 
someone in black ops that it did in
modern<00:02:43.330> warfare<00:02:43.420> 2<00:02:43.840> my<00:02:44.020> work<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.350> almost<00:02:44.650> took

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
modern warfare 2 my work to almost took

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.620 
modern warfare 2 my work to almost took
like<00:02:45.010> nothing<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.970> kill<00:02:46.150> someone<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.510> know

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
like nothing to kill someone so you know

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.390

with<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.960> I<00:02:50.230> really<00:02:50.470> need<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.710> higher<00:02:51.040> fire

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
with this I really need a higher fire

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.490 
with this I really need a higher fire
rate<00:02:51.730> or<00:02:51.970> like<00:02:52.600> extended<00:02:53.020> mags<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.350> good

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
rate or like extended mags is good

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.590 
rate or like extended mags is good
because<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.430> I'm<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.940> greatest<00:02:55.180> guy

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600

that a little bit of an extra clip

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.380 
that a little bit of an extra clip
