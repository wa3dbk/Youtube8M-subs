00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
mixed together and then just adding a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.880 
mixed together and then just adding a
little<00:02:18.920> bit<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.730> neon<00:02:20.270> glow<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.350> them<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.770> make

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
little bit of neon glow to them to make

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.920 
little bit of neon glow to them to make
them<00:02:21.950> look<00:02:22.250> more<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.260> orange<00:02:24.770> pink<00:02:25.550> purple

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
them look more in the orange pink purple

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.750 
them look more in the orange pink purple
like<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.280> because<00:02:28.280> when<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.459> put<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
like that because when you put the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.810 
like that because when you put the
yellow<00:02:28.910> over<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.750> turns<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.140> more<00:02:30.290> orange

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
yellow over it it turns it more orange

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.580 
yellow over it it turns it more orange
but<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.970> also<00:02:32.150> allows<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.840> be<00:02:33.049> a<00:02:33.080> little<00:02:33.380> bit

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
but it also allows it to be a little bit

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.949 
but it also allows it to be a little bit
less<00:02:33.830> all<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:34.910> color<00:02:35.180> if<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.810> little

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
less all one color if you have a little

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.750 
less all one color if you have a little
bit<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.010> there<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.250> doesn't<00:02:37.400> matter<00:02:37.610> and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
bit here and there it doesn't matter and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.080 
bit here and there it doesn't matter and
this<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:37.970> okay<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.660> now<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.140> my<00:02:39.320> black

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
acrylic paint and I've thinned it down

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.600 
acrylic paint and I've thinned it down
to<00:02:42.650> water<00:02:42.860> okay<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.060> want<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.570> be<00:02:44.690> water<00:02:44.959> thin

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
to water okay I want it to be water thin

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.759 
to water okay I want it to be water thin
I'm<00:02:46.610> laying<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.150> brush<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.840> side<00:02:47.870> near<00:02:48.739> the

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
I'm laying my brush on the side near the

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.570 
I'm laying my brush on the side near the
cuticle<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.610> pushing<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:52.220> gives<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.549> a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
cuticle and pushing that gives you a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.130 
cuticle and pushing that gives you a
perfectly<00:02:53.180> straight<00:02:53.510> line<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.900> then<00:02:53.989> you

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
perfectly straight line and then you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.380 
perfectly straight line and then you
kind<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.530> pull<00:02:54.830> through<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.120> gives<00:02:56.330> you

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
kind of pull through and that gives you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.710 
kind of pull through and that gives you
a<00:02:56.450> thick<00:02:56.720> line<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:58.570> then<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.720> pull<00:02:59.930> up<00:03:01.690> then

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
a thick line and then you pull up then

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.610 
a thick line and then you pull up then
down

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.850
