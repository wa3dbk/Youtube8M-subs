with<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> let<00:01:36.000> alone<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.240> triple<00:01:36.659> kill<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> don't

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
with it let alone a triple kill I don't

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.840 
with it let alone a triple kill I don't
know<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> got<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> miracle

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
know how I got it but it was a miracle

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.899 
know how I got it but it was a miracle
uh<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:40.229> car<00:01:40.530> bomb<00:01:40.770> killed<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
uh one car bomb killed not that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.240 
uh one car bomb killed not that
difficult<00:01:42.180> took<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.110> 10<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.680> 12<00:01:43.950> games

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
difficult took me like 10 to 12 games

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
difficult took me like 10 to 12 games
but<00:01:44.820> still<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.329> number<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.990> maps<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.439> have

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
but still the number of maps that have

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.830 
but still the number of maps that have
cars<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> very<00:01:48.000> small<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> game

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cars on them is very small in this game

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.810 
cars on them is very small in this game
then<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.619> need<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:49.950> 10<00:01:50.220> double<00:01:50.579> kills

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
then you need to get 10 double kills

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.639 
then you need to get 10 double kills
again<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> worst<00:01:51.990> thing<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
again that is the worst thing in the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.649 
again that is the worst thing in the
world<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:53.100> getting<00:01:54.030> double<00:01:54.329> kills<00:01:54.540> with

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
world because getting double kills with

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.679 
world because getting double kills with
the<00:01:54.720> RPG<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.890> easy<00:01:56.159> task<00:01:56.310> take<00:01:57.210> down<00:01:57.420> a
