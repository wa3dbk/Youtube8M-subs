00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:45.660 
still like it cuz awkward isn't always
bad<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.160> it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.279 

I<00:00:45.730> don't<00:00:46.449> have<00:00:46.539> titles<00:00:47.019> for<00:00:47.320> them<00:00:47.469> yet<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.870> my

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
I don't have titles for them yet in my

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.020 
I don't have titles for them yet in my
computer<00:00:50.800> I'm<00:00:51.250> calling<00:00:51.519> them<00:00:51.850> my

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
computer I'm calling them my

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.770 
computer I'm calling them my
consciousness<00:00:52.629> series<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:55.239> they<00:00:55.420> really

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
consciousness series because they really

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.990 
consciousness series because they really
feel<00:00:56.019> deeply<00:00:56.589> connected<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.190> my<00:00:57.339> meditation

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
feel deeply connected to my meditation

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:12.210 
feel deeply connected to my meditation
practice<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:09.220> not<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.570> illustration<00:01:11.220> but

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
practice they're not a illustration but

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.499 
practice they're not a illustration but
maybe<00:01:12.520> they're<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.850> travel<00:01:13.750> diary<00:01:15.509> actually

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
maybe they're a travel diary actually

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.430 
maybe they're a travel diary actually
this<00:01:16.630> one<00:01:17.880> goes<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.090> other<00:01:19.119> direction<00:01:19.360> well<00:01:20.229> I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
this one goes the other direction well I

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.010 
this one goes the other direction well I
can't<00:01:20.800> believe<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.100> now<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.479> upside<00:01:22.810> down

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.760 

can<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:26.530> that<00:01:26.860> light<00:01:28.170> change<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.470> sheen

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
can you see that light change and sheen

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.800 
can you see that light change and sheen
so<00:01:30.369> it's<00:01:30.549> just<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.789> very<00:01:31.179> light<00:01:31.630> white<00:01:32.159> form<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
so it's just a very light white form on

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.850 
so it's just a very light white form on
top<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.409> this<00:01:35.530> very<00:01:35.830> deep<00:01:36.190> field<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:38.259> lots<00:01:38.679> of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
top of this very deep field of lots of

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.770 
top of this very deep field of lots of
blues<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.640> obviously<00:01:40.149> these<00:01:40.299> will<00:01:40.509> have<00:01:40.659> to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
blues and obviously these will have to

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.800 
blues and obviously these will have to
be<00:01:40.869> photographed<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.759> carefully<00:01:43.299> so<00:01:43.780> as

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
be photographed really carefully so as

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.249 
be photographed really carefully so as
not<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.289> get<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.740> reflections<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.580> but

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
not to get all the reflections in but

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:57.490 
not to get all the reflections in but
not<00:01:47.259> by<00:01:47.500> me<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:48.399> don't<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.229> skill

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the same fashion on a much larger scale

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.120 
the same fashion on a much larger scale
I<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:14.370> about<00:02:14.610> 5<00:02:15.530> 2<00:02:16.530> foot<00:02:16.770> by<00:02:16.800> two<00:02:16.980> foot

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.930 
if you see my hand you can get a sense
of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.070> scale<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> beautiful

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
of the scale all right have a beautiful

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.150 
of the scale all right have a beautiful
day
