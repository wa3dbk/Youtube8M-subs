00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
 I see it now on my face 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 slight such a difference then it is still 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 after the summer, some skin still tanned 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 but if for example I become snow white 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520
 of course tan comes off of course me 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.460
 i'm not quite a hand reaching out for him i am so 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.350
 I think no I will take a fireplace out that he suddenly 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 just do not want ethanal 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.549
 lie this i won't use it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.159
 but this thing is cool here first ate 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.229
 I put it in the box a long time ago when I take it 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.760
 I will need a favor now I put on 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.430
 the table is not necessarily worth it because 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.770
 every day every day I put 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.619
 and on top I can let or powder 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 a little bit to put or in communication whose 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.299
 face is fine just here if on our 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.100
 somewhere hours here and come to center 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.290
 and here in three or four days I come there 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.979
 function yes until you show i come up to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 the mirror 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 In principle, I have such an intense all 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.799
 in you in motion I should have 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.189
 all the daddies of the lot zone would be shining here 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.670
 but but here I have a little bit 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.939
 started to shine and literally literally 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 will be from the wings of the nose all that is here 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.750
 these places they hold well that is 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.360
 nothing creeps away 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.119
 convenient packaging is possible to take with you 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.920
 on so insanely thin and generally so 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.840
 super very easy and even 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.690
 cosmetic bag so threw the road somewhere 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.280
 with myself 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.850
 but I feel a nice touch on my face 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.430
 to face i don't feel this congestion 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.290
 to the postal komi and so on yes with 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.600
 what is there there he wants just 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.630
 in the morning on the face, that is, this effect 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.380
 ease and here it was that good 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.670
 keeps on the skin with it only breathe 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.310
 pores clog me up 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.370
 then of course I have a hand again and again 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.670
 reaching for him for a shower and again i'm not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 liked this classic mojito 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.000
 stated that in principle the gel has 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.830
 so mild detergent effect but you 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.960
 You know, I have a feeling somehow 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.330
 I'm just a cartoon bubble you 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.520
 you get sick yourself yes this water 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.410
 just just thicker and 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.380
 with this pleasant scent would just 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.390
 rinse the skin but no such 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.340
 effect of softness when pleasantness here 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.410
 this gel is not erased into the skin and you 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.900
 feel that here you are just a favor with 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.090
 do not use care 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.330
 so cheap there 150 rubles is it something 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.489
 this one here was this series 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.790
 inductive and film somehow there I am 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.959
 sensational this brilliance 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.440
 I forgot the series I will say number 3 4 7 such 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:22.200
 huge little brush little tubes here 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.989
 such a huge brush I do not know honestly 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.360
 than this brilliance attracted many right there 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.070
 Generally such lighting reviews there 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.980
 even limits puppies plan how much 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.410
 tubes take I immediately even grabbed 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.290
 would order it to us not to try 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.209
 necessarily what is convenient is convenient that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.060
 small packs are convenient to take with you 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.140
 and it's basically light enough too 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.350
 he is not bulky 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.150
 see so very small but not 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.970
 comfortable brush it's pretty big 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.550
 you need to carefully and so make up that is 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.510
 only with a mirror and to understand that 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.590
 There's nowhere you something extra inflicted somewhere 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.930
 smeared it I do not know the usual color 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 which is transparent has several not 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.489
 small sparkles or some such 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.650
 trick is that any shine that is not 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.750
 the very principle of lunch gives lips but it 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.970
 of course he is more than such bulky lips 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.729
 he makes nado says he is maxi 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.359
 plex maxi shine 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.910
 that's about stickiness it is present 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.800
 how many such cheap gloss 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.380
 such ordinary stickiness want of course 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.289
 try me like that 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:37.789
 Further lipstick from the series, too, Deborah 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:41.039
 I have this in tenth shades with 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.860
 red-pink red-pink 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.900
 Here the color took such a saturated color as 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.729
 I would love for the winter muffled 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.889
 shades of those lipstick faberlic already 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.870
 I have them I like girls 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.930
 they have a soft texture they are very 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.419
 they are good on the lips they are like butter 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.850
 lie down and at the same time they all contain 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.770
 the caring properties they smooth 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.270
 cubes and that is after that when you 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.099
 wash their effect such as here 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.979
 you just he was so good good 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.620
 lip balm of course cool lipstick 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.389
 and that's it from such series that there 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.199
 at 200 rubles higher 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:21.389
 not cheap something good carrot 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.789
 quality lipstick is nothing bad at all 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.860
 I will say on a five-point scale, I just 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.020
 full five for just such a mask 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.360
 which will nourish the skin understand and 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.460
 because in winter it is very necessary and 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.160
 vita kislorod and normal skin here 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.729

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.849
 skin moisturize and restore and 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.699
 efficiency she has all her properties 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.440
 justifies i don't know if she feeds her 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.449
 as far as right here stated 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.699
 but in principle, I see a good effect 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:58.449
 keep 10 15 minutes on the face and then wash off 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.659
 this skin is even stones 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.699
 k peeled is very soft and sufficient 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.759
 elastic and mask contains jojoba oil 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.069
 which actively moisturize the skin and 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.099
 makes it soft also contained 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.919

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.449
 smoothing makes skin smooth 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.779
