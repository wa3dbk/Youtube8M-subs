correct yes now can you talk to us about
some<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> effects<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.630> worked<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
some of the effects that you worked on I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.040 
some of the effects that you worked on I
created<00:00:32.279> primarily<00:00:32.850> environment<00:00:33.809> effects

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
created primarily environment effects

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
created primarily environment effects
and<00:00:34.290> weapon<00:00:34.680> effects<00:00:34.950> muzzle<00:00:35.610> flashes

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and weapon effects muzzle flashes

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660 
and weapon effects muzzle flashes
impacts<00:00:36.690> tracers<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> environment

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
impacts tracers and then the environment

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.670 
impacts tracers and then the environment
affects<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.059> typically<00:00:39.420> include<00:00:39.899> water

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
affects would typically include water

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.069 
affects would typically include water
smoke<00:00:41.670> any<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> haze<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:43.020> atmosphere<00:00:45.079> now

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
smoke any kind of haze or atmosphere now

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
smoke any kind of haze or atmosphere now
we're<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.800> splitting<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.340> into

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
we're going to be splitting this up into

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
we're going to be splitting this up into
two<00:00:48.120> separate<00:00:48.539> parts<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.320> one

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
two separate parts we're going to do one

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
two separate parts we're going to do one
part<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.520> some<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> effects<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.239> worked

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
part with some of the effects you worked

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.819 
part with some of the effects you worked
on<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:51.750> we'll<00:00:51.870> save<00:00:52.410> something<00:00:52.710> for

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
on and then we'll save something for

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
on and then we'll save something for
another<00:00:53.340> video<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
another video so what are we going to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.819 
another video so what are we going to
take<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> look<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.350> first<00:00:55.559> time

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
take a look at here in this first time

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.260 
take a look at here in this first time
this<00:00:55.980> first<00:00:56.250> video<00:00:56.430> we're<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> look<00:00:57.090> at

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
this first video we're going to look at

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.229 
this first video we're going to look at
a<00:00:57.480> muzzle<00:00:57.930> flash<00:01:01.430> first<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> open

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a muzzle flash first I'm going to open

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.289 
a muzzle flash first I'm going to open
the<00:01:03.660> effect<00:01:03.960> an<00:01:04.140> unreal<00:01:04.439> cascade<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.369> here

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the effect an unreal cascade and here

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.609 
the effect an unreal cascade and here
you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.630> there's<00:01:07.049> quite<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.470> few

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you can see there's quite a few

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.060 
you can see there's quite a few
components<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> effect<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.439> really

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
components to this effect and I really

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
components to this effect and I really
only<00:01:11.220> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> pay<00:01:11.880> attention<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.570> one

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
only want to pay attention to this one

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.219 
only want to pay attention to this one
element<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:14.159> which<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.180> large<00:01:15.479> conical

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
element here which is this large conical

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.960 
element here which is this large conical
shape<00:01:16.530> coming<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.430> end<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
shape coming out of the end of the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.820 
shape coming out of the end of the
muzzle<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
muzzle and I think this is one of the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
muzzle and I think this is one of the
most<00:01:19.950> important<00:01:20.490> elements<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.390> effect

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
most important elements to this effect

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929 
most important elements to this effect
because<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.350> helps<00:01:22.439> show<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> pot<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
because it really helps show the pot the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810 
because it really helps show the pot the
power<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.810> size<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> projectile<00:01:26.280> that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
power and size of the projectile that's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.070 
power and size of the projectile that's
probably<00:01:27.150> coming<00:01:27.479> out<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> end<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
probably coming out of the end of this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760 
probably coming out of the end of this
weapon<00:01:28.560> okay<00:01:29.220> um<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.020> another<00:01:31.140> element

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
weapon okay um and in another element

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
weapon okay um and in another element
that<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.369> new<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.390> Unreal

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that we have which is new to Unreal

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.080 
that we have which is new to Unreal
Engine<00:01:33.840> 4<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.530> ability<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.340> emit<00:01:35.820> light

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Engine 4 is the ability to emit light

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
Engine 4 is the ability to emit light
into<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.540> world<00:01:36.680> using<00:01:37.680> our<00:01:37.950> particle<00:01:38.430> lights

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
into the world using our particle lights

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
into the world using our particle lights
and<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.750> particle<00:01:40.200> lights<00:01:40.380> are<00:01:40.680> controlled

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and these particle lights are controlled

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.359 
and these particle lights are controlled
using<00:01:41.790> traditional<00:01:42.470> cascade<00:01:43.470> modules<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
using traditional cascade modules and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
using traditional cascade modules and
light<00:01:44.850> properties<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.810> based<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.470> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
light properties are all based off of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310 
light properties are all based off of
the<00:01:46.799> initial<00:01:47.430> size<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.090> color<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.869> actual

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the initial size and color of the actual

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
the initial size and color of the actual
particle<00:01:49.829> very<00:01:50.579> nice<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.270> any

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
particle very nice now are there any

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.810 
particle very nice now are there any
other<00:01:51.770> elements<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.040> muzzle<00:01:53.310> flare<00:01:53.610> that

other elements to this muzzle flare that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
other elements to this muzzle flare that
really<00:01:54.060> start<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.020> pop<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.470> really

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
really start to make it pop that really

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.260 
really start to make it pop that really
kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.829> bring<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> life<00:01:56.310> sure<00:01:56.790> another

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
kind of bring it to life sure another

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
kind of bring it to life sure another
thing<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.649> important

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
thing that I really think is important

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100 
thing that I really think is important
to<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.310> effect<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.000> distortion<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to this effect is the distortion that

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.620 
to this effect is the distortion that
we're<00:02:01.229> using<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> world<00:02:02.149> this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.299> using

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
we're using in the world this is using

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.109 
we're using in the world this is using
the<00:02:04.229> refraction<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.979> our<00:02:05.070> material<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the refraction and our material which is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
the refraction and our material which is
a<00:02:06.240> new<00:02:06.450> feature<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.869> Unreal<00:02:07.170> Engine<00:02:07.200> 4<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:08.280> had

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
a new feature in Unreal Engine 4 we had

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.580 
a new feature in Unreal Engine 4 we had
distortion<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.030> unreal<00:02:09.330> 3<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.720> unreal<00:02:10.289> 4<00:02:10.470> we

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
distortion in unreal 3 but unreal 4 we

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.619 
distortion in unreal 3 but unreal 4 we
have<00:02:10.679> refraction<00:02:11.250> now<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:12.180> really<00:02:12.480> feel

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
have refraction now and I really feel

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.700 
have refraction now and I really feel
like<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.780> helps<00:02:13.260> can

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
like this helps can

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.190 
like this helps can
to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> effect<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.550> world<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.900> just

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to the effect to the world and and just

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
to the effect to the world and and just
sort<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.470> pushes<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.070> pixels<00:02:17.850> around<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
sort of pushes the pixels around and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.360 
sort of pushes the pixels around and
really<00:02:18.540> gives<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.050> sense<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.650> it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
really gives you the sense that it's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.790 
really gives you the sense that it's
part<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.970> environment<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.710> I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
part of the environment and so here if I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
part of the environment and so here if I
just<00:02:22.830> rename<00:02:23.460> all<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.970> different<00:02:24.270> elements

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
just rename all the different elements

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.500 
just rename all the different elements
you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.780> see<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.340> muzzle<00:02:26.580> flash<00:02:26.760> has<00:02:27.180> some

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you can see the muzzle flash has some

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.780 
you can see the muzzle flash has some
venting<00:02:28.380> out<00:02:28.590> coming<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.220> sides<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
venting out coming out of the sides and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
venting out coming out of the sides and
there's<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> several<00:02:30.780> different<00:02:31.080> components

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
there's a several different components

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.930 
there's a several different components
that<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:31.830> help<00:02:32.010> show<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.760> is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that really help show you that this is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.420 
that really help show you that this is
also<00:02:33.330> an<00:02:33.810> automatic<00:02:34.500> weapon<00:02:34.890> yeah<00:02:35.220> that's

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
also an automatic weapon yeah that's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.010 
also an automatic weapon yeah that's
sound<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:36.120> looks<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.810> should<00:02:36.990> be

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
sound that just looks like it should be

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.200 
sound that just looks like it should be
loud<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.380> powerful<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.460> should<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.910> able<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
loud and powerful and should be able to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.590 
loud and powerful and should be able to
stop<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> raging<00:02:40.260> elephant<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:41.880> also<00:02:42.240> notice

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
stop a raging elephant now I also notice

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.480 
stop a raging elephant now I also notice
that<00:02:42.630> we've<00:02:42.840> got<00:02:43.020> some<00:02:43.260> shell<00:02:43.530> casings<00:02:43.770> flying

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
that we've got some shell casings flying

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.400 
that we've got some shell casings flying
out<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> side<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.300> gun<00:02:45.450> yes<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.200> shell

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
out of the side of the gun yes the shell

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
out of the side of the gun yes the shell
casings<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.070> again<00:02:47.400> they're<00:02:47.790> being<00:02:48.090> emitted

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
casings are again they're being emitted

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.030 
casings are again they're being emitted
through<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.930> effect<00:02:49.260> which<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.800> great

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
through the effect which is great

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.860 
through the effect which is great
because<00:02:50.280> now<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.730> control<00:02:51.240> those<00:02:51.450> all<00:02:51.720> in

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
because now I can control those all in

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.080 
because now I can control those all in
one<00:02:52.050> location<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.520> you're<00:02:53.670> saying<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.910> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
one location so you're saying that the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.600 
one location so you're saying that the
muzzle<00:02:54.420> flash<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.380> shell<00:02:56.040> casing<00:02:56.400> coming

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
muzzle flash and the shell casing coming

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.680 
muzzle flash and the shell casing coming
out<00:02:56.700> are<00:02:56.790> all<00:02:56.850> part<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> exact<00:02:57.540> same

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
out are all part of the exact same

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.930 
out are all part of the exact same
effect<00:02:57.990> yes<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.890> shell<00:02:59.190> casings<00:02:59.640> are<00:02:59.820> in

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
effect yes the shell casings are in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.340 
effect yes the shell casings are in
local<00:03:00.270> space<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.840> inherit<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
local space so they inherit the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.440 
local space so they inherit the
transformed<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> weapon<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.760> then<00:03:03.420> I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
transformed of the weapon and then I

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.300 
transformed of the weapon and then I
just<00:03:03.570> offset<00:03:04.170> their<00:03:04.320> positions<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.070> they

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
just offset their positions so that they

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920 
just offset their positions so that they
eject<00:03:05.640> from<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.910> right<00:03:06.090> location<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
eject from the right location on the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.130 
eject from the right location on the
side<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> gun<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.390> fly<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.570> over<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:09.960> you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
side of the gun and fly up over here you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.520 
side of the gun and fly up over here you
can<00:03:10.320> see<00:03:10.530> our<00:03:10.740> giant<00:03:11.220> robot<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.930> he's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
can see our giant robot here and he's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.620 
can see our giant robot here and he's
just<00:03:13.980> pouring<00:03:14.640> shells<00:03:14.970> out<00:03:15.210> into<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
just pouring shells out into the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.390 
just pouring shells out into the
environment<00:03:15.780> he<00:03:16.590> burned<00:03:16.860> through<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> ammo

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
environment he burned through the ammo

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.960 
environment he burned through the ammo
and<00:03:18.150> using<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.750> CPU<00:03:19.260> system<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:19.890> track<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and using a CPU system I can track the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.910 
and using a CPU system I can track the
position<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.600> these<00:03:21.780> shells<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.380> then<00:03:22.530> emit

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
position of these shells and then emit

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.670 
position of these shells and then emit
smoke<00:03:23.670> from<00:03:24.090> each<00:03:24.330> shell<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:25.050> its<00:03:25.440> falling

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
smoke from each shell as its falling

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.740 
smoke from each shell as its falling
through<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.040> world<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.390> guy's<00:03:27.570> also

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
through the world I see this guy's also

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.020 
through the world I see this guy's also
got<00:03:27.960> tracer<00:03:28.350> fire<00:03:28.560> as<00:03:28.800> well<00:03:28.950> yes<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.000> that

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
got tracer fire as well yes now is that

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.880 
got tracer fire as well yes now is that
part<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.540> his<00:03:30.750> muzzle<00:03:31.050> flash<00:03:31.350> effect<00:03:31.560> or

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
part of his muzzle flash effect or

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.950 
part of his muzzle flash effect or
separate<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.670> tracer<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.270> bundled<00:03:33.720> with<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
separate the tracer is bundled with the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.720 
separate the tracer is bundled with the
muzzle<00:03:34.380> flashes<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:34.950> helps<00:03:35.250> us<00:03:35.370> show<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
muzzle flashes it helps us show the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.670 
muzzle flashes it helps us show the
direction<00:03:35.880> without<00:03:36.270> having<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.990> add<00:03:37.260> another

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
direction without having to add another

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.790 
direction without having to add another
component<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.520> then<00:03:38.670> track<00:03:39.480> two<00:03:39.720> items<00:03:40.140> in

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
component and then track two items in

00:03:40.800 --> 00:04:05.460 
component and then track two items in
matinee<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.490> just<00:03:41.670> fire<00:03:41.910> off<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.330> effect

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.890 

okay<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:06.530> these<00:04:07.370> are<00:04:07.579> some<00:04:07.879> of<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.209> impact

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
okay so these are some of the impact

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.839 
okay so these are some of the impact
effects<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.500> were<00:04:09.650> seen<00:04:09.980> at<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.220> very<00:04:10.400> tail

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
effects that were seen at the very tail

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.880 
effects that were seen at the very tail
end<00:04:10.909> of<00:04:11.299> infiltrator<00:04:11.810> when<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.170> flying<00:04:12.530> robot

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890

is<00:04:13.010> shooting<00:04:13.280> at<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.430> ground<00:04:13.670> yes<00:04:14.390> and

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
is shooting at the ground yes and

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.659 
is shooting at the ground yes and
typically<00:04:15.409> when<00:04:15.650> we're<00:04:15.829> creating<00:04:15.980> an<00:04:16.340> impact

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
typically when we're creating an impact

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.219 
typically when we're creating an impact
effect<00:04:17.030> there's<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.269> couple<00:04:17.479> things<00:04:17.720> we<00:04:17.959> keep

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
effect there's a couple things we keep

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.140 
effect there's a couple things we keep
in<00:04:18.350> mind<00:04:18.620> we<00:04:19.190> think<00:04:19.400> about<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.729> size<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
in mind we think about the size of the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.550 
in mind we think about the size of the
projectile<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.720> also<00:04:20.989> think<00:04:21.199> about<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
projectile and also think about the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.159 
projectile and also think about the
surface<00:04:22.009> that<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.520> projectiles<00:04:23.180> impacting

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
surface that the projectiles impacting

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.070 
surface that the projectiles impacting
so<00:04:25.070> here<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:25.490> have<00:04:25.520> concrete<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.870> first

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
so here we have concrete so the first

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.830 
so here we have concrete so the first
thing<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.440> did<00:04:27.620> was<00:04:27.770> create<00:04:28.430> some<00:04:28.699> meshes<00:04:29.600> that

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
thing I did was create some meshes that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.540 
thing I did was create some meshes that
are<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:30.289> came<00:04:30.500> from<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.860> concrete<00:04:31.340> on<00:04:31.430> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
are that came from this concrete on the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.100 
are that came from this concrete on the
ground<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:32.060> they<00:04:32.120> have<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> same<00:04:32.539> material

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
ground and they have the same material

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.689 
ground and they have the same material
so<00:04:33.259> they<00:04:33.380> have<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> same<00:04:33.800> visual<00:04:34.190> qualities

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
so they have the same visual qualities

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.480 
so they have the same visual qualities
and<00:04:34.940> I'll<00:04:35.720> mitt<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.050> concrete<00:04:36.650> with<00:04:36.919> cascade

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
and I'll mitt that concrete with cascade

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.900 
and I'll mitt that concrete with cascade
and<00:04:38.139> because<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.740> concrete<00:04:40.220> as<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.580> lip

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
and because the concrete as a lip

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.700 
and because the concrete as a lip
material<00:04:41.360> on<00:04:41.479> it<00:04:41.510> is<00:04:41.690> accepting<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.410> lighting

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
material on it is accepting the lighting

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.230 
material on it is accepting the lighting
from<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> world<00:04:43.160> as<00:04:43.400> well<00:04:43.580> as<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:43.940> lighting

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
from the world as well as the lighting

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.150 
from the world as well as the lighting
coming<00:04:44.419> from<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.780> particle<00:04:45.020> system<00:04:45.500> so<00:04:45.800> I

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
coming from the particle system so I

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.070 
coming from the particle system so I
notice<00:04:46.610> you're<00:04:46.729> also<00:04:46.880> kicking<00:04:47.210> up<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.510> lot<00:04:47.690> of<00:04:47.720> I

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
notice you're also kicking up a lot of I

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.990 
notice you're also kicking up a lot of I
guess<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.470> would<00:04:48.800> be<00:04:48.830> more<00:04:49.190> dust<00:04:49.550> than<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:49.880> is

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
guess it would be more dust than it is

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.430 
guess it would be more dust than it is
smoke<00:04:50.240> as<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.810> concrete<00:04:51.320> gets

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
smoke as the the concrete gets

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.960 
smoke as the the concrete gets
pulverized<00:04:51.710> now<00:04:52.220> is<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.460> actually<00:04:52.789> being

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
pulverized now is that actually being

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.270 
pulverized now is that actually being
lit<00:04:53.210> in<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.510> world<00:04:53.720> yes<00:04:54.530> all<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.830> dust<00:04:55.160> is

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
lit in the world yes all the dust is

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.430 
lit in the world yes all the dust is
being<00:04:55.520> lit<00:04:55.729> by<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:55.910> lights<00:04:56.510> in<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.810> world<00:04:57.139> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
being lit by the lights in the world and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.800 
being lit by the lights in the world and
so<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:58.190> see<00:04:58.400> here<00:04:58.610> i<00:04:58.639> added<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.180> purple

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
so you can see here i added a purple

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.659 
so you can see here i added a purple
light<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.680> side<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.099> this<00:05:01.280> effect

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
light to the to the side of this effect

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.969 
light to the to the side of this effect
so<00:05:01.849> that<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.090> could<00:05:02.270> get<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.750> effect<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.889> the

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
so that you could get the effect of the

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.310 
so that you could get the effect of the
lighting<00:05:04.340> on<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.520> smoke<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.449> dust<00:05:05.570> you

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
lighting on the smoke and the dust you

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.540 
lighting on the smoke and the dust you
know<00:05:06.410> it's<00:05:06.530> funny<00:05:06.680> we<00:05:07.009> had<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.310> move<00:05:07.430> the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
know it's funny we had to move the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.950 
know it's funny we had to move the
camera<00:05:07.759> over<00:05:08.000> before<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.360> notice<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.810> looks

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
camera over before I notice it looks

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.570 
camera over before I notice it looks
like<00:05:09.080> there's<00:05:09.229> also<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.500> lot<00:05:09.710> of<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.010> gravel

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
like there's also a lot of like gravel

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.820 
like there's also a lot of like gravel
being<00:05:10.820> kicked<00:05:11.120> up<00:05:11.300> yeah<00:05:11.900> all<00:05:12.229> these<00:05:12.470> little

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
being kicked up yeah all these little

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.490 
being kicked up yeah all these little
tiny<00:05:13.130> chunks<00:05:13.699> are<00:05:13.880> translucent<00:05:14.720> particles

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
tiny chunks are translucent particles

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.279 
tiny chunks are translucent particles
using<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:16.010> translucent<00:05:16.699> material<00:05:16.849> so<00:05:17.599> they'll

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
using a translucent material so they'll

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.320 
using a translucent material so they'll
get<00:05:18.440> illuminated<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.250> lit<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:19.760> like<00:05:19.940> the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
get illuminated and lit just like the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.080 
get illuminated and lit just like the
meshes<00:05:20.750> do<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.169> they'll<00:05:22.159> actually<00:05:22.430> collide

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
meshes do and they'll actually collide

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.939 
meshes do and they'll actually collide
and<00:05:23.330> bounce<00:05:23.599> along<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.110> ground<00:05:24.260> based<00:05:24.590> on<00:05:24.800> the

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
and bounce along the ground based on the

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.920 
and bounce along the ground based on the
surface<00:05:25.130> normal<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.090> depth<00:05:26.300> buffer<00:05:26.539> so

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
surface normal and the depth buffer so

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.450 
surface normal and the depth buffer so
those<00:05:27.289> are<00:05:27.440> just<00:05:27.560> little<00:05:27.860> sprites<00:05:28.250> those

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
those are just little sprites those

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.370 
those are just little sprites those
aren't<00:05:28.699> really<00:05:28.909> tiny<00:05:29.180> meshes<00:05:29.630> yes<00:05:30.139> they're

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
aren't really tiny meshes yes they're

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.260 
aren't really tiny meshes yes they're
just<00:05:30.590> all<00:05:30.800> small<00:05:31.190> sprites<00:05:31.580> along<00:05:31.940> with<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
just all small sprites along with the

in<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:43.050> Vista<00:05:43.500> shots<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.950> infiltrator<00:05:44.520> you'll

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
in the Vista shots of infiltrator you'll

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.160 
in the Vista shots of infiltrator you'll
notice<00:05:45.060> there's<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.270> lot<00:05:45.390> of<00:05:45.420> traffic<00:05:45.750> and

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
notice there's a lot of traffic and

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.130 
notice there's a lot of traffic and
robots<00:05:46.770> moving<00:05:47.100> around<00:05:47.540> in<00:05:48.540> this<00:05:48.720> case<00:05:48.930> I'm

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
robots moving around in this case I'm

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.440 
robots moving around in this case I'm
just<00:05:49.170> emitting<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:50.160> robot<00:05:50.490> mesh<00:05:50.790> that<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
just emitting the robot mesh that the

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.870 
just emitting the robot mesh that the
modelers<00:05:52.080> created<00:05:52.530> and<00:05:52.680> I'm<00:05:53.160> attaching<00:05:53.430> lens

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
modelers created and I'm attaching lens

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.910 
modelers created and I'm attaching lens
flares<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.600> part<00:05:55.200> of<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.380> lights<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.800> the

flares and part of the lights to the

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.680 
flares and part of the lights to the
robot<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.730> that<00:05:56.910> as<00:05:57.000> they<00:05:57.150> move<00:05:57.360> through<00:05:57.390> the

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
robot so that as they move through the

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.270 
robot so that as they move through the
world<00:05:57.810> they're<00:05:58.110> actually<00:05:58.530> illuminating<00:05:59.130> all

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
world they're actually illuminating all

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.640 
world they're actually illuminating all
the<00:05:59.430> geometry<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.210> you<00:06:00.690> can<00:06:00.840> see<00:06:01.050> them<00:06:01.260> more

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
the geometry and you can see them more

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.170 
the geometry and you can see them more
of<00:06:01.710> them<00:06:01.920> back<00:06:02.100> here<00:06:02.130> in<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.550> background<00:06:03.000> we

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
of them back here in the background we

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.540 
of them back here in the background we
use<00:06:03.900> those<00:06:04.080> extensively<00:06:04.710> in<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:04.980> Vista<00:06:05.310> shots

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
use those extensively in the Vista shots

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.270 
use those extensively in the Vista shots
to<00:06:06.120> just<00:06:06.360> add<00:06:06.510> an<00:06:06.660> extra<00:06:06.930> detail<00:06:07.350> to<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.740> world
