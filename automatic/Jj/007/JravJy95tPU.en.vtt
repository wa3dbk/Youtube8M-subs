00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 and 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.880
 when we offer treatment 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.430
 doctor to patients we hope that by 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.369
 Of course the discomfort disappears without 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.380
 However, there are patients who persist with 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.970
 symptomatology this is that they have 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.119
 still discomfort despite the treatment 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.920
 doctor and there are discomforts that disappear 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.900
 of course but they can return 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.629
 after medical treatment is 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.670
 then when we can suppose 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.890
 that these people could be 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.290
 candidates to receive treatment 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.960
 surgical here then we 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.610
 we have to reevaluate the case of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 our patients the first situation 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.989
 is that the patient who did not respond 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.510
 adequately to treatment and that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.309
 endoscopically has data from 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.400
 Esophageal inflammation such as esophagitis 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.070
 that I commented previously have to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.930
 undergo complementary tests 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.200
 diagnostic the first of them by 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.110
 course is the esophageal manometer that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.500
 helps us determine how the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.290
 esophagus pressures is important 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.100
 say that the esophagus is an organ that in 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 the lower portion 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.299
 in a high pressure area and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
 logically having a high area 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.420
 pressure that is called esophageal sphincter 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.240
 lower will prevent backflow per se 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.030
 of food from the stomach to the esophagus 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.250
 when this sphincter pressure 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.350
 decreases reflux favors the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.240
 esophageal manometry then as a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 complementary diagnosis is going to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.190
 evaluate exactly how is the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.039
 pressure of the esophagus and if the pressure is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.890
 permanently low is a person who 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.289
 can be a candidate for treatment 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.200
 surgical another complementary test 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.970
 that is requested with some regularity and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.619
 which is in fact the gold standard of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.710
 diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 is the ph and esophageal metrics the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.860
 Perimetry is just going to help us 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 evaluate how much acid is flowing 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.680
 to the esophagus and the percentage of time that 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.140
 is going to be the esophagus with more acid 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.970
 that we should know we can 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.069
 have functional reflux or 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.190
 physiological this is the people who 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.220
 they may have a bit of acidity but without 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.060
 become 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.940
 or disease when the symmetry pea 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.640
 shows a persistence of acidity in 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.060
 the esophagus are those people that if 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.150
 are candidates for surgical treatment 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.250
 now not all people will be 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.890
 candidates to do the three tests that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.900
 I'm saying but it's usual to be 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.580
 very certain that the treatment 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.710
 surgery will benefit the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.100
 people that we are going to offer 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.560
 we have them then the anti treatment 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.610
 surgical reflux that is the creation of 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.040
 a high-pressure zone made by 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.959
 we the surgeons in what it consists 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.900
 then with the same stomach 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.790
 can we wrap the esophagus and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.310
 generate that high pressure area that is 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.900
 lost and that's why it was planned 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.320
 predisposes to the development of reflux 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.330
 this surgery is called fundoplication is 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.620
 a surgery that has been done for 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.440
 many years and it returns to the patient a 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.989
 practically free life that agruras 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.310
 is the colloquial term of the symptoms 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.060
 of reflux 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.160
 and of course a normal life the way 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.630
 of doing the procedure right now is 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.150
 through minimal surgery 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.880
 invasion or laparoscopic surgery that is 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.030
 a surgery that offers the patient a 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.060
 faster recovery and easy 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.800
 integration to everyday life 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.920
 understanding that being the gold standard 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.200
 does not make it the only option since 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.630
 there are people people who are 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.940
 can against somehow indicate the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.769
 laparoscopic procedure and you have 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.290
 to do the surgery as usual 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.569
 it was done more than 15 years ago that is the 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.060
 open surgery you also have to comment 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.069
 in the very important patient that in 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.350
 some cases the complications 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.180
 techniques or the technical difficulty of 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.760
 do the procedure via 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.770
 laparoscopic is real and you have to 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.919
 convert the procedure to a surgery 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.740
 open because the first thing that needs to be 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.139
 offer the patient is safety and a 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.190
 procedure that does not offer security not 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.190
 it is an adequate procedure
