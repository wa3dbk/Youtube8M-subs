00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
so easily and if there are lumps formed

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.830 
so easily and if there are lumps formed
then<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.900> break<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> fork<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.840> keep

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
then just break it with a fork and keep

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.970 
then just break it with a fork and keep
this<00:02:37.020> as<00:02:38.030> separate<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.180> possible<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.650> first

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this as separate as possible the first

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.220 
this as separate as possible the first
thing<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.460> am<00:02:41.520> going<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:42.030> do<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.450> play<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
thing I am going to do is play with the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.710 
thing I am going to do is play with the
key<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:44.510> put<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:45.810> store<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.270> just<00:02:48.270> turn<00:02:48.540> on

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
key I put it on store and just turn on

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.310 
key I put it on store and just turn on
the<00:02:48.900> heat<00:02:52.310> keep<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.670> low<00:02:53.700> heat<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.570> when

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the heat keep it on low heat and when

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.120 
the heat keep it on low heat and when
the<00:02:55.350> key<00:02:56.310> starts<00:02:56.820> melting<00:02:57.120> put<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.130> garam

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the key starts melting put the garam

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.030 
the key starts melting put the garam
masala<00:02:59.550> into<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.900> while<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.380> key<00:03:01.770> is

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
masala into it so while the key is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.180 
masala into it so while the key is
melting<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.790> am<00:03:02.970> doing<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.930> mashing<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.920> these

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
melting I am doing the mashing of these

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.430 
melting I am doing the mashing of these
two<00:03:05.430> pieces<00:03:05.820> together<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.750> taken<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.200> 1

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
two pieces together I have taken a 1

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.570 
two pieces together I have taken a 1
inch<00:03:07.710> piece<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.220> ginger<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:10.280> cut<00:03:11.280> it

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
inch piece of ginger I have just cut it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.530 
inch piece of ginger I have just cut it
into<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.210> little<00:03:13.340> smaller<00:03:14.340> pieces<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.150> that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
into a little smaller pieces so that

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.860 
into a little smaller pieces so that
mashing<00:03:16.170> will<00:03:16.350> be<00:03:16.530> easier<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.610> taken

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
mashing will be easier and I have taken

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.050 
mashing will be easier and I have taken
1<00:03:18.870> tablespoon<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.620> fennel<00:03:20.130> seeds<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.850> am

pestle<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.690> am<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:25.020> going<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.500> mash<00:03:26.100> them

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
pestle and I am just going to mash them

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.780 
pestle and I am just going to mash them
together

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.030 

I<00:03:32.489> like<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.760> texture<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.450> be<00:03:34.480> coarse<00:03:35.379> just

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
I like the texture to be coarse just

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.600 
I like the texture to be coarse just
like<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.519> if<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.470> don't<00:03:38.470> like<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.980> rough

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
like so if you don't like the rough

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.880 
like so if you don't like the rough
texture<00:03:40.150> then<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.659> can<00:03:40.900> make<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.319> grind<00:03:41.709> it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
texture then you can make and grind it

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.869 
texture then you can make and grind it
must<00:03:42.340> smoother<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.200> key<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.530> nicely<00:03:45.340> hot

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
must smoother see the key is nicely hot

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.440 
must smoother see the key is nicely hot
now

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
now

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.809 
now
bubbles<00:03:46.959> are<00:03:47.140> slowly<00:03:47.470> forming<00:03:48.099> into<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.610> and

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
bubbles are slowly forming into it and

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.160

hear<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.790> sound<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.329> spluttering<00:03:58.870> and

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
hear the sound of spluttering and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.330 
hear the sound of spluttering and
bubbles<00:04:01.000> are<00:04:01.180> still<00:04:01.480> forming<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.980> will<00:04:03.129> know

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
bubbles are still forming you will know

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.710 
bubbles are still forming you will know
when<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.909> G<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.340> flavoured<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.819> total

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
when the G is flavoured the total

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.759 
when the G is flavoured the total
process<00:04:08.109> is<00:04:08.290> ready<00:04:08.980> by<00:04:10.349> saying<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.620> the

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
process is ready by saying that the

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.770 
process is ready by saying that the
bubbles<00:04:12.159> won't<00:04:12.400> be<00:04:12.609> there<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.060> key<00:04:13.540> will<00:04:13.750> be

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
bubbles won't be there the key will be

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.449 
bubbles won't be there the key will be
nice<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.590> clear<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:17.320> can<00:04:17.500> see<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.979> bubbles

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
nice and clear you can see that bubbles

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.569 
nice and clear you can see that bubbles
has<00:04:18.639> almost<00:04:19.150> stopped<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.859> can<00:04:21.070> safely<00:04:21.310> say

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
has almost stopped and I can safely say

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.100 
has almost stopped and I can safely say
that<00:04:22.030> flavoring<00:04:22.690> of<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:23.020> key<00:04:23.260> is<00:04:23.500> done<00:04:23.889> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
that flavoring of the key is done and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.379 
that flavoring of the key is done and
normally<00:04:26.110> we<00:04:26.260> say<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.800> he<00:04:27.430> tada<00:04:27.789> Java<00:04:28.180> hey<00:04:28.360> I

this<00:04:32.740> immediately<00:04:33.490> off<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.910> heat<00:04:34.330> because

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
this immediately off the heat because

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.770 
this immediately off the heat because
otherwise<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.889> key<00:04:36.310> will<00:04:36.580> burn<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.180> after

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
otherwise the key will burn and after

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.230 
otherwise the key will burn and after
that<00:04:37.960> we<00:04:38.169> start<00:04:38.500> clearing<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.160> rice<00:04:39.340> now<00:04:40.180> we

will start layering the rice for doing
that<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.449> have<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.080> coat<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.620> honey<00:04:44.889> with<00:04:45.190> heat

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that I have to coat the honey with heat

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.870 
that I have to coat the honey with heat
first<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.120> then<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:47.020> will<00:04:47.380> make<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.250> layer<00:04:48.610> of
