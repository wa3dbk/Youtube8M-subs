00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.490
 two 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.840
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 channel had not come up for a while 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.829
 video and we're not going to fool ourselves and I've 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.730
 I've been playing quite a few games 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:26.520
 online and well I had the option to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 canto steal 20 so much in playstation 4 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.829
 as unique in xbox one and the truth that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 well I wanted to make a comparison for 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.989
 that you see a little bit the difference 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.629
 graph that could be between the two 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.949
 consoles and a priori or this I will say 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.690
 that practically the two in practice 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.270
 in the same yes you have to be very fussy 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 spin very thin 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 we will appreciate sometimes especially in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.040
 certain textures that are a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.130
 little bit more defined in playstation 4 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.980
 we know that with 1080 and instead in 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.220
 xbox are connected to a rate a little bit 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
 lower 900 means and peak 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.910
 let's hope it goes to 60 frames per 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.090
 second as much in one as the other but 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.090
 good 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:20.710
 and really the creators of what they have 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.630
 created this new ip they really gave a 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.500
 important graphic jump that really 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.540
 you can appreciate a little bit about 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.370
 new generation console that time 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.100
 up to date really with all the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.500
 games that we have been testing and we have 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.040
 seen that the games really do not have 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.740
 any 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.690
 no incentive beyond melted 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.370
 graphical improvement to point needle 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.810
 we have not seen really great things 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.190
 improve what we have seen in 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.750
 our previous consoles and that in 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.880
 very little better graphics would only be missing 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.729
 that we were better graphic more 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.130
 definition but good the system of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.470
 game little more something controlled 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.120
 usually then really 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.240
 does a little bit 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.950
 a new innovation has been made and 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.250
 really take advantage of the power of 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.110
 these new consoles I'm putting a 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.170
 little 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.380
 animation and a little game for 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.500
 really see in motion both a 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.020
 as another the image generated by video and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.320
 a real game image so that 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.910
 have yourselves the impression of 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.300
 which version is better or if they are the same or 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.550
 I already tell you those differences can be 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 appreciate but it really is very similar 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.480
 to a new smile 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.980
 also take advantage of this video that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.440
 I'm going up I want to make a new 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.510
 section of each holiday study 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.350
 now I want to take advantage and try to upload 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.910
 some video more usually 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.370
 weekly a weekly match can be a 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.390
 I work pretty pretty messed up but 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.840
 good to try to resume again as 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.690
 minimum his usual Libyan life 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.900
 so that you have other content in the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.280
 channel that spiritually and I want to do 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.800
 a new section where I'm really going to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.230
 put greens to games that really 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.240
 I'm going to assess the negative points 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.960
 really what I think that is not worth the 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.140
 penalty of the games 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.150
 we all see youtube analysis is that 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.150
 many the field is good 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.140
 as a promotion what really 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.760
 things give us games so that 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.350
 really the little ones of your channel and 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.930
 logically for not saying anything bad not 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.940
 because they give you what they facilitate and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.130
 to be able to access previous ones and it's before 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.050
 the others what you are going to tell me is to put 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.030
 from the game and what really 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.510
 I want to put 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.290
 really my point of view and focus it 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.290
 in the negative things 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.100
 as well as the games that really 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 maybe he has a lot and such good is 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.269
 will advance something that may be 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.350
 white sox between one of them 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.130
 generally the games that were going to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.130
 appreciate a great innovation at the level of 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.810
 next gen and we have realized that good 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.419
 well 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.790
 it has not been not expecting it I am not going to 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.540
 overtake more I also want to tell you 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.669
 that you follow me also on twitter that 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.330
 he also had a lot more information 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:47.500
 usual because faster more comfortable and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.120
 more deaf the radio is not going to be that 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.860
 that also takes up a lot of space 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:58.789
 time to put a tweet really 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.560
 an information to a point of view or 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.840
 I'll put my twitter account here for 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.669
 do not follow me I know there are some 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.229
 that you are following me but good more than 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.080
 nothing so you also have it in 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.300
 account and you can go then also 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.280
 informing about the news of the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.599
 launches and especially those that 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.629
 appearing in the games I will also go 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:25.020
 putting on twitter like guys here you 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:27.780
 I leave this small comparison for 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.599
 that you really offer what is in one 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.279
 and in another in a console this same 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.529
 game remember that it is a beta version 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:38.779
 which is what we have 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:41.039
 could play you know that we have it in 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.439
 our stores from 9 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:47.620
 September this game will be available 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:49.900
 to put it to be able to buy it 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.729
 I also take the opportunity to say a little 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.400
 how good the game has reminded me so much 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.639
 to hello the world hey parrots that you have 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.520
 had the opportunity to play it on xbox 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:03.460
 Well, you know what I mean, those who do not 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.040
 you have the opportunity to play a 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.560
 very emblematic saga of microsoft and that 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.790
 the users of sony it has not been 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.850
 could play 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.940
 I tell you that also good has not 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.330
 Surprised 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.560
 and I see again more or less for me is 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.390
 a what he froze then good 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.360
 I guess there are also different a 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:31.050
 little bit more updated but it has not 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.050
 contributed 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.560
 something that I really wanted to see them 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.230
 let's give it a little time is a 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.070
 dam version 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.650
 has undoubtedly good things 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.930
 with the theme of multiplayer campaign me 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.020
 we like we'll see how it looks 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.990
 behaves both online 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.100
 the game looks good has good 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.750
 pint but good 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.810
 I had the feeling that it would be something 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.480
 different more innovative I think more or 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:06.200
 least I can continue in the line of so many 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.000
 years created with it but good we have 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.370
 an opportunity for you to really have 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.930
 I have doing also we will perform it and 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.730
 especially if nothing happens then 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.610
 I will upload also to my channel I will put it 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:21.220
 green or red us or upload a game
