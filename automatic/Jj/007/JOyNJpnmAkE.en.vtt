hey everyone so this week we're doing

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.670 
hey everyone so this week we're doing
the<00:02:09.340> main<00:02:09.729> theme<00:02:10.060> from<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.780> fireman<00:02:11.350> games

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the main theme from the fireman games

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.220 
the main theme from the fireman games
which<00:02:12.010> features<00:02:12.760> across<00:02:13.270> quite<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> few<00:02:14.140> of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
which features across quite a few of

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.530 
which features across quite a few of
them<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.500> different<00:02:14.680> forms<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.330> very

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
them in different forms it's a very

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.010 
them in different forms it's a very
simple<00:02:16.870> orchestral<00:02:17.680> piece<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
simple orchestral piece and I think the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.230 
simple orchestral piece and I think the
key<00:02:20.470> elements<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.070> are<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.460> has<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.820> great

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
key elements to it are it has a great

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.780 
key elements to it are it has a great
melody<00:02:22.660> which<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.130> very<00:02:24.370> sort<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
melody which is it's very sort of a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.270 
melody which is it's very sort of a
royal<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.630> grand<00:02:25.900> which<00:02:26.200> complements<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
royal and grand which complements the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.199 
royal and grand which complements the
the<00:02:27.580> series<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.240> well<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.860> main<00:02:30.700> part<00:02:31.090> of

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
the series really well the main part of

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
the series really well the main part of
this<00:02:31.450> track<00:02:31.959> was<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.560> violin<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.100> really

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
this track was the violin so I really

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.680 
this track was the violin so I really
focused<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.730> them<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:33.970> did<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> lot<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.540> them

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
focused in them I did a lot of them

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.460 
focused in them I did a lot of them
there's<00:02:35.590> kaitlin's<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.090> which<00:02:37.720> was<00:02:37.959> an

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
there's kaitlin's this one which was an

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
there's kaitlin's this one which was an
octave<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.010> then<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.550> didn't<00:02:39.760> octave<00:02:40.060> down<00:02:40.209> on

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
octave up then we didn't octave down on

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.559 
octave up then we didn't octave down on
that<00:02:40.540> one

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
that one

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.600 
that one
and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.019> used<00:02:43.200> some<00:02:43.260> orchestral<00:02:44.189> sort<00:02:44.519> of

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and then I used some orchestral sort of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.990 
and then I used some orchestral sort of
violins<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> big<00:02:46.170> section<00:02:46.379> here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
violins like a big section here

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.220 
violins like a big section here
and<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.690> section<00:02:48.930> another

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and then in this section another

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.500 
and then in this section another
fire<00:02:51.410> off<00:02:51.680> sort<00:02:52.069> of<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.550> those<00:02:52.670> together

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.850 

for<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.780> rest<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.349> just<00:02:59.440> like

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
for the rest of it it's just like

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.440 
for the rest of it it's just like
filling<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.340> up<00:03:00.400> with<00:03:00.459> orchestral<00:03:01.239> lines

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
filling it up with orchestral lines

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.000 
filling it up with orchestral lines
there's<00:03:01.810> some<00:03:01.930> homes

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.250 

some<00:03:06.790> woodwinds

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.610 

over<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.520> some<00:03:13.700> flutes<00:03:13.970> come<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.620> with

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
over here that some flutes come in with

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.890 
over here that some flutes come in with
a<00:03:15.800> couple<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.310> bowls<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.790> background

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
a couple of bowls in the background

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.770 
a couple of bowls in the background
and<00:03:19.019> obviously<00:03:20.299> orchestral<00:03:21.299> percussion<00:03:21.420> is

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
and obviously orchestral percussion is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.229 
and obviously orchestral percussion is
usually<00:03:22.080> quiet<00:03:22.349> symbol<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.239> cinematic

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
usually quiet symbol and this cinematic

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.100 
usually quiet symbol and this cinematic

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
so I used just a simple display to give

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.710
