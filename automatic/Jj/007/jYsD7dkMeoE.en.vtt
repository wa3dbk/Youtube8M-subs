00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 we go between here 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.830
 frame but who said what phil 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.740
 about putting you on fire 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 we would be living the knicks is true 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 marcus something has failed is concise 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.460
 if I'm put it seems that those 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.929
 we could be one of them 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 I hope to see that the middle one does not 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's on fire it seems that it carries one thing 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.989
 of those like the one that takes place in the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.989
 head look I need you to get a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.329
 color that I do not know how he is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 special performances are you going to believe what 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.739
 we have found sea knife a lot 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.519
 you have to give him the cap sharpened 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 right now give you my cap filis that 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.570
 joke the jmas well that skeleton 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.549
 there are not flames because he wears a hat 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.049
 and that's a damn stupidity can 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:05.909
 there are several reasons why that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.220
 skeleton is not point we are to try 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.569
 try on the hat and we will look for a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.399
 hat because this is mine 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.409
 I'm not going anywhere because they could 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.819
 call means I am a cap 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.890
 and you will not have a good hat 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.200
 we could probably when you see me 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.119
 with mine you will begin to appreciate how handsome 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 I 'm so good that I'm left alone 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.020
 just want to try and try me how 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 I seriously is so cool 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.679
 more handsome and well thank you very much you know 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 that would not be funny with that hat 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.450
 like a monkey would look like a monkey and 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.810
 It would be ridiculous with this hat go 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.469
 the truth if it would seem to know it would be 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469
 very funny 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:01.740
 look, it looks like a money, it looks like a monkey 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:06.300

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 stairs and we can all now I go back 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.740
 we have to go 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.489
 what the hell seems stupid that you weigh 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.260
 the head this protects you from fire 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.459
