00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello very good morning to all this 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:08.320
 tutorial I 've done to learn in 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.870
 is setting the command of the beach in 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.120
 your pc 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.360
 to be able to play games like fifa 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.700
 with what I'm seeing what there is to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.770
 to do is download is a program that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.020
 it's called ds3 ds3 tour or motion and today 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.610
 and leave a good description clean 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.700
 macro we have downloaded we can 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.630
 connect our command for the usb and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.750
 open the program as soon as you have to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.640
 do now is 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.059
 we get 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.059
 in 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.250
 control or driver administrator and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 the hardware will appear in the port 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.420
 in which we have connected the command not what 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.040
 we mark and we give the drivers it's going to 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.010
 be a time like this and once you 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.190
 have installed probably ask you or 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.070
 if you do not do it, you will start 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.310
 the computer not well once restarted 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.060
 and all that we come to fast start 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.119
 and what controls connected dual shock 3 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.640
 6 to 6 fire is seen if we put 2 us 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.649
 two will appear well and now here we 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 appears the digital control that would be 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.149
 like that of the play or do not control something 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.689
 that it would be like the coat but with 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.520
 the joystick control the two 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.200
 would be a mold the upl and three for that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 like the fingers and the control 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.149
 analog 3 that would be the free and 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.340
 an xbox 360 control simulator here 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.960
 is the one that I recommend to use because 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.179
 there are many games that do not recognize in 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.360
 the controls of vultures but yes those of 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.819
 xbox and here we also get a profile 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.459
 personalized yes to you all these 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:58.540
 appear English you mark language and 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.420
 selections in the Spanish language 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.160
 and good once we have marked the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.200
 kind of control we want we give to 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.540
 enable and you're done this is all 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.540
 happened a greeting and up
