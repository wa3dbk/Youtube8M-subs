 under today we end up on a 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.270
 new title the datas times 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.340
 so as I mentioned them in the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.529
 last video I did I do 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.449
 several videos on both texts 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.670
 as for the chicken first 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.610
 video what I'm doing right now 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.540
 will be on the sliding panels as 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.080
 you want then first of all we 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.920
 let's go I'll do a little gaffe 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:56.799
 circus situation amar to cope 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.409
 provides a canoe because with the idea 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.110
 the idea the name of the jokes in minecraft 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.729
 I noticed that the tarn where he is a 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.590
 little alone to hold then what is there 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.630
 know that there are two types of 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.760
 channels there are peoples and handing over 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.930
 tanuki it was the wild thing as we 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.180
 can see it here that he is the one 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.240
 sludge is a little less interesting because 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.869
 as golf &amp; spa but cuckolds 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.090
 is like something next to the bed and 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.960
 that there is an updated blake to 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:40.060
 next to him he wants to put them because 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 so even if there is a wall you can 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.219
 put that breezy time to see that he 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.249
 must still fall even if it will 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.649
 Malian wall behind the second shot that 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:54.999
 is a lot more a little know these 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:58.689
 listings standing and standing stein 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:02:02.770
 yes I olds to launch and his 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:06.159
 minions is ours who on foot and who 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:12.000
 not catch a wall and unlike 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:17.630
 a wall5 alas we do not do it himself 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.010
 it will not break even if 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.460
 even if m blocking on him then for 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.530
 these it was for the names of the five 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.190
 now we are going to enter the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.240
 technical part with datas taggs 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.970
 so I was I could on this button here 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.860
 you will see that this is the naughty he 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.370
 not spawn that is a canoe with 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.810
 written text that as always it's a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:57.230
 example and let's see a little at the khl 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:01.220
 the command that there is in so the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.280
 orders these seven breaks to place 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.980
 relatively relative relative block this 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.770
 to put the faces fanny the panel 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.340
 above the orders blick 60 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.110
 euros 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.290
 it's double the standing singh 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.810
 concludes the father support us if I 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.150
 could say it's 6 0 this is the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.370
 of orientation at all to our that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:35.480
 since it is different you are 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:39.260
 observant ferrante orientation ranging from 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 0 to 15 I like it is the way to place 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.790
 the blacks 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.840
 the principle is composed it will be yes 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.959
 planes so what's going easy it's going 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.450
 replace the blacks who are already there by 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.520
 the block we want and rhinestones etc know 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:02.450
 not that it's okay in addition to replay 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.590
 it's going to remind him to call each 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.790
 block when the destroy then the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.530
 dates and ex it so what for the blow for 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.540
 those who doubt us there are four 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.100
 and the text a text extracted and ex cat 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.170
 and to show you how that 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.900
 works I'm going to do an example 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.320
 so what I do again game I put myself 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.530
 in the cat and I will lead the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.110
 order 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.670
 the cowardly importance cédric i'm going to the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.530
 shape to where I am 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.420
 now 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:43.540
 then we can put minecraft and 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:48.580
 ndinga standing signs important 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:51.930
 cheekbone spurs then the orientation 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.990
 we want for the example we will put quickly 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.250
 who poses it from the orientation that I have 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.170
 put for others 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.830
 to us then we want to put the ip milk 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.900
 for debts and ex- dolphin 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.090
 very important brace the column for 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.610
 for those who do not know where the anthem 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.570
 is on canadian serge keyboards 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.660
 defalet key al character plus 7 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.920
 as for the French keyboard I 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.610
 have no idea 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.440
 because I've never used so 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.460
 solid for the French who looks 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:34.350
 this video has found her head to 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:38.290
 head text a very important to put 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.280
 an uppercase a capital t this name it 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:47.470
 not work and we will do for 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.750
 the example remarry hello then 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.940
 locked to kayad for those for the 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:58.450
 Canadian keyboard is zé seat quarrata 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:04.330
 faster one there normally if I read 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:06.450
 well done again the pernaut it is in 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.440
 the opposite direction to this ring one 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.950
 since this one there is an orientation 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.350
 as you see an orientation 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.669
 2 0 cells there is an orientation 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:22.480
 empty donkey upside down 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.749
 so I think that having said everything about 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.150
 attack dates 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:28.770
 on the panels success it was gold 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.860
 commander I tell you called all the 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.860
 world
