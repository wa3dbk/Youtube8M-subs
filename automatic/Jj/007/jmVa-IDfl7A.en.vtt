until<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:57.000> four<00:00:57.420> years<00:00:57.660> ago<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:58.170> they

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
until about four years ago when they

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
until about four years ago when they
came<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> Optima<00:00:59.280> everything

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
came out with the Optima everything

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.830 
came out with the Optima everything
seemed<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> fall<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.329> place

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
seemed to fall into place

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
seemed to fall into place
for<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:01.859> they've<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> big<00:01:02.520> guarantee

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
for them they've got the big guarantee

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.530 
for them they've got the big guarantee
and<00:01:03.860> here<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and here it is I like I just think this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
and here it is I like I just think this
car<00:01:06.840> looks<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.439> car<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.830> aimed<00:01:08.040> directly<00:01:08.130> at

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
car looks this car is aimed directly at

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
car looks this car is aimed directly at
the<00:01:08.729> Honda<00:01:08.880> Civic<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> looks

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the Honda Civic and I think it looks

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.320 
the Honda Civic and I think it looks
better<00:01:10.140> than<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> Honda<00:01:10.740> Civic<00:01:11.070> Coupe<00:01:11.610> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
better than the Honda Civic Coupe that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
better than the Honda Civic Coupe that
is<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.400> has<00:01:15.110> cleaner<00:01:16.110> styling<00:01:16.740> cues

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
is it really has cleaner styling cues

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.910 
is it really has cleaner styling cues

inside<00:02:03.210> we're<00:02:03.390> gonna<00:02:03.479> look<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.810> front<00:02:04.049> now

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
inside we're gonna look in front now

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.649 
inside we're gonna look in front now
look<00:02:05.219> under<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> hood<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> high

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
look under the hood there's that high

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.499 
look under the hood there's that high
level<00:02:07.110> insulation<00:02:07.799> too<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.970> permeates

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
level insulation too and that permeates

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.730 
level insulation too and that permeates
itself<00:02:09.959> through

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
itself through

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.130

the<00:02:10.920> cabin<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.970> engine<00:02:12.210> is<00:02:12.300> strong<00:02:12.510> makes<00:02:12.990> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the cabin the engine is strong makes a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.350 
the cabin the engine is strong makes a
nice<00:02:13.620> conservative<00:02:14.310> noise<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.000> there's<00:02:15.120> even

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
nice conservative noise and there's even

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.660 
nice conservative noise and there's even
some<00:02:15.390> insulation<00:02:15.960> against<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> firewall<00:02:16.670> so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
some insulation against the firewall so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.240 
some insulation against the firewall so
we<00:02:18.570> can't<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.380> Ross<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> I

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
we can't see it here but Ross and I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.800 
we can't see it here but Ross and I
checked<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.820> was<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:20.940> oh<00:02:21.210> my<00:02:21.390> god<00:02:21.600> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
checked it on it was like oh my god this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.320 
checked it on it was like oh my god this
is<00:02:21.990> very<00:02:22.020> high<00:02:22.470> level<00:02:22.860> D<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.820> consequently

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
is very high level D so consequently

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.580 
is very high level D so consequently
when<00:02:24.630> you're<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> highway<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> road

when you're on the highway the road

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
when you're on the highway the road
noise<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> tire<00:02:26.460> noise<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.000> every<00:02:27.180> all

noise and the tire noise and every all
exterior<00:02:28.530> noises<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.190> very<00:02:29.430> muted<00:02:29.670> inside

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
exterior noises is very muted inside

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.800 
exterior noises is very muted inside
it's<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.170> Class<00:02:31.620> C<00:02:31.890> Kia<00:02:32.820> styling<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> we're

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
it's the Class C Kia styling that we're

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.570 
it's the Class C Kia styling that we're
beginning<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.140> get<00:02:34.350> used<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> seeing<00:02:34.860> big

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
beginning to get used to seeing big

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.890 
beginning to get used to seeing big
round<00:02:35.820> clear<00:02:36.030> gauges<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.680> think<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.900> level

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
round clear gauges and I think the level

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.630 
round clear gauges and I think the level
of<00:02:40.110> standard<00:02:40.560> equipment<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.040> always<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.520> little

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
of standard equipment is always a little

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.070 
of standard equipment is always a little
bit<00:02:41.790> higher<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.300> Koreans<00:02:42.660> that's<00:02:42.900> their

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
bit higher with the Koreans that's their

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.000 
bit higher with the Koreans that's their
value<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.540> fit<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.930> finish<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.440> fit<00:02:46.650> and

value and the fit and finish the fit and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.510 
value and the fit and finish the fit and
finish<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:47.820> high-level<00:02:49.160> those<00:02:50.160> seams

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
finish is very high-level those seams

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.310 
finish is very high-level those seams
there's<00:02:50.970> hardly<00:02:51.270> any<00:02:51.480> seams<00:02:51.810> between<00:02:52.020> the

the<00:03:02.070> air-conditioned<00:03:02.760> seat<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.120> tried<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
the air-conditioned seat I tried it and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.420 
the air-conditioned seat I tried it and
it<00:03:03.810> works<00:03:04.610> very<00:03:05.610> nice<00:03:05.910> screen<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
it works very nice screen the the the

it works very nice screen the the the
screen<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.910> just<00:03:09.020> very<00:03:10.020> good-looking

you have the backup camera you have push

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.540 
you have the backup camera you have push
start/stop<00:03:13.530> once<00:03:14.040> again<00:03:14.250> look<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.430> the

seamless gaps of the of the fit and
finish<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.310> mean<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.700> very<00:03:18.060> high<00:03:18.600> level

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020

another thing that I noticed is that a
lot<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.640> people<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.390> fake<00:03:21.600> carbon

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
lot of people have like the fake carbon

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.900 
lot of people have like the fake carbon

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
fiber trim this one is fake but it's

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.430 
fiber trim this one is fake but it's
very<00:03:24.270> high<00:03:24.510> level<00:03:24.840> has<00:03:24.990> a<00:03:25.020> nice<00:03:25.260> little

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.630 

the<00:05:46.030> engine<00:05:46.420> is<00:05:47.070> relatively<00:05:48.070> smooth<00:05:48.400> for<00:05:48.610> a

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
the engine is relatively smooth for a

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.790 
the engine is relatively smooth for a
1.6<00:05:49.120> liter<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.600> doesn't<00:05:50.200> sound<00:05:50.380> like<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.560> tin

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
1.6 liter it doesn't sound like a tin

1.6 liter it doesn't sound like a tin

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
and that turbo gives it plenty of push

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.800 
and that turbo gives it plenty of push
to<00:05:55.020> pass<00:05:55.200> people<00:05:55.790> and<00:05:56.790> if<00:05:57.090> ever<00:05:57.270> once<00:05:57.600> in<00:05:57.690> a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.200 

downshifted<00:06:03.080> pretty<00:06:03.530> fast

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
downshifted pretty fast

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.549 
downshifted pretty fast
it's<00:06:05.660> bullying

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:07.559 
it's bullying

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.339 
it's bullying
it's<00:06:08.069> not<00:06:08.189> making<00:06:08.399> that<00:06:08.639> much<00:06:08.879> noise<00:06:09.349> here

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
it's not making that much noise here

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.839 
it's not making that much noise here
we're<00:06:10.529> doing<00:06:10.619> 16<00:06:11.039> kilometers<00:06:11.459> an<00:06:11.549> hour<00:06:11.609> we're

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
we're doing 16 kilometers an hour we're

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:12.519 
we're doing 16 kilometers an hour we're
doing<00:06:12.029> great

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
doing great

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.009 
doing great
let's<00:06:13.529> slow<00:06:13.679> down<00:06:13.709> right<00:06:14.099> now<00:06:14.279> and<00:06:14.899> that<00:06:15.899> was

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:16.019 
let's slow down right now and that was

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:18.139 
let's slow down right now and that was
pretty<00:06:16.229> effortless<00:06:16.799> I<00:06:17.069> think<00:06:17.459> the<00:06:17.669> engine

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:18.149 
pretty effortless I think the engine

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:20.179 
pretty effortless I think the engine
could<00:06:18.449> do<00:06:18.569> that<00:06:18.689> all<00:06:18.899> day<00:06:18.929> long

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
could do that all day long

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.279 
could do that all day long
he<00:06:20.999> says<00:06:21.179> there's<00:06:21.389> nothing<00:06:21.689> about<00:06:21.899> this<00:06:22.109> car

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
he says there's nothing about this car

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:23.599 
he says there's nothing about this car
that<00:06:22.439> makes<00:06:22.589> you<00:06:22.709> want<00:06:22.889> to<00:06:22.979> go<00:06:23.069> fast<00:06:23.369> once

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:23.609 
that makes you want to go fast once

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:26.269 
that makes you want to go fast once
again<00:06:23.879> I<00:06:24.119> was<00:06:24.839> speaking<00:06:25.109> to<00:06:25.349> Ross<00:06:25.529> and<00:06:25.949> he<00:06:26.099> was

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
again I was speaking to Ross and he was

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.949 
again I was speaking to Ross and he was
saying<00:06:26.489> that<00:06:26.759> the<00:06:26.939> car<00:06:27.179> it's<00:06:27.689> a<00:06:27.779> very

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:27.959 
saying that the car it's a very

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.499 
saying that the car it's a very
homogeneous<00:06:28.289> car<00:06:28.859> meaning<00:06:29.129> that<00:06:29.429> nothing<00:06:30.389> is

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
homogeneous car meaning that nothing is

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.449 
homogeneous car meaning that nothing is
out<00:06:30.719> of<00:06:30.749> place<00:06:31.109> everything<00:06:31.649> fits<00:06:32.189> together

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:32.459 
out of place everything fits together

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.609 
out of place everything fits together
and<00:06:32.909> I<00:06:32.999> have<00:06:33.479> to<00:06:33.629> agree<00:06:33.869> with<00:06:33.899> them<00:06:34.169> that's<00:06:34.439> the

00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:34.619 
and I have to agree with them that's the

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.859 
and I have to agree with them that's the
impression<00:06:34.829> I'm<00:06:35.159> getting<00:06:35.189> also<00:06:35.689> so<00:06:36.689> although

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:36.869 
impression I'm getting also so although

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:38.959 
impression I'm getting also so although
the<00:06:37.139> handling<00:06:37.769> of<00:06:37.889> this<00:06:37.979> car<00:06:38.249> sucks

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
the handling of this car sucks

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.549 
the handling of this car sucks
despite<00:06:39.389> its<00:06:39.539> looks<00:06:39.809> that<00:06:39.989> it<00:06:40.109> could<00:06:40.319> handle

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559 
despite its looks that it could handle

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.879 
despite its looks that it could handle
the<00:06:41.339> Civic<00:06:41.699> Si<00:06:41.939> does<00:06:42.119> that<00:06:42.269> much<00:06:42.449> better

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
the Civic Si does that much better

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.559 
the Civic Si does that much better
everything<00:06:43.889> else<00:06:44.219> it<00:06:44.549> does<00:06:44.969> better<00:06:45.329> than<00:06:45.449> the

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
everything else it does better than the

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.189 
everything else it does better than the
Civic<00:06:45.929> Si<00:06:46.259> including<00:06:46.949> comfort<00:06:47.429> and<00:06:47.609> looks<00:06:47.939> so

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
Civic Si including comfort and looks so

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.289 
Civic Si including comfort and looks so
you're<00:06:49.199> the<00:06:49.469> trade-off<00:06:49.799> is<00:06:49.979> good<00:06:50.189> if<00:06:50.459> comfort

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:51.299 
you're the trade-off is good if comfort
