00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the last pistol you unlock in black ops

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.960 
the last pistol you unlock in black ops
2

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
2

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.340 
2
I<00:01:15.000> love<00:01:15.390> people<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.110> probably

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I love people think that's probably

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
I love people think that's probably
because<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> best<00:01:17.040> pistol<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> backups

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
because it's the best pistol and backups

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
because it's the best pistol and backups
but<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.689> into<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> layer<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
but you know get into that layer so the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
but you know get into that layer so the
catfight<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> fully<00:01:20.970> automatic

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
catfight is actually a fully automatic

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.820 
catfight is actually a fully automatic
pistol<00:01:21.750> nasta<00:01:22.080> actually<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> main<00:01:22.560> reason<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
pistol nasta actually the main reason I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
pistol nasta actually the main reason I
think<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.189> unlocked<00:01:23.460> last<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
think it's unlocked last because it's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.090 
think it's unlocked last because it's
the<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.600> fully<00:01:25.020> automatic<00:01:25.530> pistol<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.950> black

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the only fully automatic pistol in black

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.289 
the only fully automatic pistol in black
ops<00:01:26.280> 2<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.430> anyway<00:01:26.700> let's<00:01:26.880> take<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> look<00:01:27.180> at

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
ops 2 but anyway let's take a look at

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.580 
ops 2 but anyway let's take a look at
some<00:01:27.390> stats<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.200> obviously<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
some stats for it so obviously the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.929 
some stats for it so obviously the
firing<00:01:29.009> fire<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.280> gonna<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.520> quite<00:01:29.729> high

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
firing fire it's gonna be quite high

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.069 
firing fire it's gonna be quite high
because<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> said<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> fully

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
because like I said it's a fully

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.960 
because like I said it's a fully
automatic<00:01:31.409> pistol<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> never<00:01:32.520> bulleted

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
automatic pistol and never bulleted

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.130 
automatic pistol and never bulleted
who's<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.479> racing<00:01:33.840> through<00:01:33.990> it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
who's gonna come racing through it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
who's gonna come racing through it's
actually<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> decent<00:01:34.590> pistol<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> said<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
actually a decent pistol like I said I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.640 
actually a decent pistol like I said I
actually<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.630> using<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.110> from<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
actually do like using it from time to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.910 
actually do like using it from time to
time

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
time

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.289 
time
that's<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.490> damage<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> damage<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that's a damage the damage for the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
that's a damage the damage for the
pistols<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:39.990> quite<00:01:40.290> high<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.040> the

stats don't show it that high but you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.179 
stats don't show it that high but you
think<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.290> quite<00:01:43.470> high<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.100> way

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
think it's quite high because the way

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that let is now a lot Akko it's not a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.219 
that let is now a lot Akko it's not a
cuisine<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.330> weapons<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.840> decent

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
cuisine for this weapons actually decent

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.020 
cuisine for this weapons actually decent
it<00:02:10.440> doesn't<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.770> too<00:02:11.009> much<00:02:11.160> recoil<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.760> know

it doesn't have too much recoil you know

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.000 
it doesn't have too much recoil you know
you<00:02:12.090> expect<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> pistol<00:02:13.260> which<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.560> full

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you expect the pistol which is full

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.040 
you expect the pistol which is full
automatic<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.819> have<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.150> lot<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> Rico<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:15.989> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
automatic to have a lot of Rico but you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.449 
automatic to have a lot of Rico but you
know<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> recon<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.800> quite<00:02:17.040> sure<00:02:17.310> it's

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
know the recon for is quite sure it's

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.100 
know the recon for is quite sure it's
quite<00:02:17.640> as<00:02:17.730> low<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.120> well<00:02:18.269> not<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.900> why<00:02:19.080> I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
quite as low as well not to you why I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.930 
quite as low as well not to you why I
like<00:02:19.319> about<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.769> doesn't<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.489> recon

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
like about it doesn't have to but recon

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.369 
like about it doesn't have to but recon
therefore<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> accuracy<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.930> quite<00:02:22.170> decent

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
therefore the accuracy is quite decent

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.199 
therefore the accuracy is quite decent
you<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.069> actually<00:02:23.190> spray<00:02:23.670> at<00:02:23.760> people<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.120> you

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
you can actually spray at people and you

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.729 
you can actually spray at people and you
can<00:02:24.360> get<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.629> kill<00:02:24.810> because<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.319> lock<00:02:25.530> on

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.930 
as you guys would see many times in its
gameplay<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.370> guys<00:03:35.489> will<00:03:35.639> actually

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
gameplay but you guys will actually

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.099 
gameplay but you guys will actually
think<00:03:36.120> extended<00:03:36.510> clip<00:03:36.690> would<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> lot

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
think extended clip would be a lot

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.539 
think extended clip would be a lot
better<00:03:37.139> but<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.739> trust<00:03:38.040> me<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.400> gonna

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
better but I trust me that it's gonna

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.890 
better but I trust me that it's gonna
clip<00:03:38.760> doesn't<00:03:39.060> work<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.450> well<00:03:39.599> mainly

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
clip doesn't work that well mainly

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.690 
clip doesn't work that well mainly
because<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.650> only<00:03:40.769> get<00:03:40.950> about<00:03:40.980> five<00:03:41.340> extra

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
because you only get about five extra

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.099 
because you only get about five extra
bullets<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.569> that's<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.840> Moshe

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
bullets I think that's the Moshe

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.569 
bullets I think that's the Moshe
actually<00:03:43.530> get<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.919> therefore<00:03:44.190> doesn't

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
actually get and therefore doesn't

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.979 
actually get and therefore doesn't
really<00:03:44.790> do<00:03:45.000> much<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.540> guys<00:03:45.720> will<00:03:45.900> actually

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
really do much so you guys will actually

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.870 
really do much so you guys will actually
want<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.500> go<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.769> fast<00:03:46.980> mag<00:03:47.160> cuz<00:03:47.549> then<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:47.700> can

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
want to go for fast mag cuz then you can

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.009 
want to go for fast mag cuz then you can
reload<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> lot<00:03:48.359> faster<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.720> therefore<00:03:48.870> you

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
reload a lot faster and therefore you

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.659 
reload a lot faster and therefore you
can<00:03:49.139> pick<00:03:49.349> up<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.590> kill<00:03:49.859> cuz<00:03:50.250> if<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.370> go<00:03:50.519> for

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
can pick up that kill cuz if you go for

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.909 
can pick up that kill cuz if you go for
it<00:03:50.730> then<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> clip<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.450> no<00:03:51.690> fast<00:03:51.989> mag<00:03:52.200> therefore

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
it then a clip and no fast mag therefore

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.199 
it then a clip and no fast mag therefore
you<00:03:53.040> actually<00:03:53.489> won't<00:03:53.609> leave<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:53.970> reload

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
you actually won't leave to reload

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.520 
you actually won't leave to reload
faster<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.599> therefore<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.930> match<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.319> die

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
faster and therefore you match the die

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.349 
faster and therefore you match the die
but<00:03:55.980> if<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.220> guys<00:03:56.340> want<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.790> can<00:03:56.940> actually<00:03:57.030> go

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
but if you guys want you can actually go

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.659 
but if you guys want you can actually go
for<00:03:57.599> fast<00:03:58.109> mag<00:03:58.410> an<00:03:58.590> extended<00:03:59.310> clip<00:03:59.489> but

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
for fast mag an extended clip but

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.190 
for fast mag an extended clip but
actually<00:03:59.940> think<00:04:00.180> long<00:04:00.419> barrel<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.810> very<00:04:01.019> very

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
actually think long barrel is very very

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.509 
actually think long barrel is very very
important<00:04:01.590> because<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.129> range<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.430> this

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
important because the range of this

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.009 
important because the range of this
weapon<00:04:02.700> if<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.150> don't<00:04:03.359> think<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.750> would<00:04:03.840> need

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
weapon if you don't think you would need

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.479 
weapon if you don't think you would need
the<00:04:04.139> long<00:04:04.290> barrel<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.889> why<00:04:04.980> don't<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.160> go<00:04:05.310> for

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
the long barrel and why don't you go for

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.280 
the long barrel and why don't you go for
fast<00:04:05.700> mag<00:04:05.849> an<00:04:05.940> extended<00:04:06.359> clip<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.810> therefore

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
fast mag an extended clip and therefore

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.509 
fast mag an extended clip and therefore
you<00:04:07.349> can<00:04:07.500> use<00:04:07.650> those<00:04:07.799> three<00:04:08.010> together<00:04:08.160> enough

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
you can use those three together enough

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.400 
you can use those three together enough
you<00:04:08.609> can<00:04:08.760> have<00:04:08.849> more<00:04:09.180> ammo<00:04:09.419> in<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.930> clip<00:04:10.230> to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
you can have more ammo in one clip to

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.960 
you can have more ammo in one clip to
pick<00:04:10.769> up<00:04:10.889> those<00:04:11.010> skills<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.430> also<00:04:11.579> be<00:04:11.790> able<00:04:11.910> to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
pick up those skills and also be able to

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.580 
pick up those skills and also be able to
reload<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.299> lot<00:04:12.449> faster<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.079> dangerous

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
reload a lot faster in dangerous

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.390 
reload a lot faster in dangerous
situations

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
situations

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.890 
situations
now<00:04:14.639> for<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.879> lethal<00:04:15.150> members<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.569> go<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:15.870> a

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
now for the lethal members I go for a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.420 
now for the lethal members I go for a
lethal<00:04:16.049> because<00:04:16.470> obviously<00:04:16.680> using<00:04:17.130> second

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
lethal because obviously using second

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.219 
lethal because obviously using second
weapon<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.940> therefore<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.630> will<00:04:18.750> come<00:04:19.079> in

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
weapon and therefore you will come in

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.479 
weapon and therefore you will come in
times<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.590> danger<00:04:19.769> where<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> would<00:04:20.340> need

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
times of danger where you would need

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.949 
times of danger where you would need
that<00:04:20.609> lethal<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.060> pick<00:04:21.209> up<00:04:21.329> not<00:04:21.449> kill<00:04:21.720> really

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that lethal to pick up not kill really

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.750 
that lethal to pick up not kill really
quickly<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.500> therefore<00:04:23.130> doesn't<00:04:23.370> memories

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
quickly and therefore doesn't memories

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.530 
quickly and therefore doesn't memories
now<00:04:23.909> going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.270> c4

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
now going to c4

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.510 
now going to c4
let<00:04:26.080> us<00:04:26.260> move<00:04:26.410> until<00:04:26.680> I've<00:04:26.800> gone<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.100> place<00:04:27.310> of

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
let us move until I've gone the place of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.190 
let us move until I've gone the place of
personal<00:04:27.940> lightweight<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.900> obviously

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
personal lightweight like is obviously

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.840 
personal lightweight like is obviously
using<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.470> second<00:04:29.800> weapon<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.250> would<00:04:30.550> want<00:04:30.760> to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
using a second weapon you would want to

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.550 
using a second weapon you would want to
move<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.030> lot<00:04:31.240> faster<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.810> was<00:04:32.140> gonna<00:04:32.320> go<00:04:32.530> for

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
move a lot faster I was gonna go for

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.110 
move a lot faster I was gonna go for
ghosts<00:04:32.950> but<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.250> thought<00:04:33.490> didn't<00:04:33.820> make<00:04:33.970> me

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
ghosts but I thought didn't make me

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.730 
ghosts but I thought didn't make me
sound<00:04:34.240> like<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.480> ghost<00:04:34.810> because<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.350> wasn't

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
sound like a ghost because I wasn't

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.710 
sound like a ghost because I wasn't
using<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.130> second<00:04:36.430> weapon<00:04:36.610> speed<00:04:37.390> is<00:04:37.510> really

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
using the second weapon speed is really

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.970 
using the second weapon speed is really
really<00:04:37.870> important<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.380> therefore<00:04:38.620> if<00:04:38.890> you

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
really important and therefore if you

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.140 
really important and therefore if you
haven't<00:04:39.250> got<00:04:39.340> extreme<00:04:39.640> conditioning

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
haven't got extreme conditioning

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.820 
haven't got extreme conditioning
Speedy's<00:04:40.780> were<00:04:41.020> your<00:04:41.290> main<00:04:41.500> thing<00:04:41.710> and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
Speedy's were your main thing and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.930 
Speedy's were your main thing and
therefore<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.100> can<00:04:42.220> spray<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.460> lot<00:04:42.640> faster<00:04:42.910> and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
therefore you can spray a lot faster and

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.400 
therefore you can spray a lot faster and
pick<00:04:43.180> up<00:04:43.300> kills<00:04:43.540> get<00:04:43.990> out<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.170> dangerous

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
pick up kills get out of dangerous

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.630 
pick up kills get out of dangerous
situations<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:45.010> lot<00:04:45.160> quicker<00:04:45.340> as<00:04:45.610> well

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
situations a lot quicker as well

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.580 
situations a lot quicker as well
scavengers<00:04:46.630> come<00:04:46.810> just<00:04:47.020> because<00:04:47.230> like<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.530> said

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
scavengers come just because like I said

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.260 
scavengers come just because like I said
it's<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.950> second<00:04:48.250> weapon<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.640> don't<00:04:48.880> have<00:04:49.030> that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
it's a second weapon you don't have that

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.180 
it's a second weapon you don't have that
much<00:04:49.420> I'm<00:04:49.540> on<00:04:49.660> one<00:04:49.900> clip<00:04:50.170> neither<00:04:50.680> do<00:04:50.920> you<00:04:51.010> have

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
much I'm on one clip neither do you have

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.830 
much I'm on one clip neither do you have
damage<00:04:51.550> I'm<00:04:51.700> wearing<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.000> whole<00:04:52.210> gun<00:04:52.510> itself

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
damage I'm wearing the whole gun itself

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.450 
damage I'm wearing the whole gun itself
so<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.380> will<00:04:53.590> need<00:04:53.770> scuffing<00:04:54.100> just<00:04:54.220> to<00:04:54.280> pick

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
so you will need scuffing just to pick

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.250 
so you will need scuffing just to pick
up<00:04:54.580> more<00:04:54.790> ammo<00:04:55.090> on<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.300> floor<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.870> therefore

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
up more ammo on the floor and therefore

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.660 
up more ammo on the floor and therefore
you<00:04:56.560> can<00:04:56.770> go<00:04:56.920> on<00:04:57.040> those<00:04:57.160> belong<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.400> kill

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
you can go on those belong to kill

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.280 
you can go on those belong to kill
streaks<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.030> lot<00:04:58.180> longer<00:04:58.330> dexterity<00:04:59.080> mean

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
streaks a lot longer dexterity mean

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.080 
streaks a lot longer dexterity mean
event<00:04:59.530> dexterity<00:05:00.010> is<00:05:00.070> because<00:05:00.310> another<00:05:00.790> girl

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
event dexterity is because another girl

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.730 
event dexterity is because another girl
who<00:05:01.210> is<00:05:01.330> setting<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.690> up<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:01.930> as<00:05:02.020> well<00:05:02.200> the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
who is setting you up and as well the

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.170 
who is setting you up and as well the
exertion<00:05:02.920> allows<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:03.580> bounce<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.970> lot

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
exertion allows you to in bounce a lot

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.700 
exertion allows you to in bounce a lot
faster<00:05:04.510> after<00:05:04.570> sprinting<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:05.260> will<00:05:05.470> be<00:05:05.590> doing

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
faster after sprinting you will be doing

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.200 
faster after sprinting you will be doing
a<00:05:05.800> lot<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:06.010> sprinting<00:05:06.400> mainly<00:05:06.940> because<00:05:07.030> we

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
a lot of sprinting mainly because we

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.490 
a lot of sprinting mainly because we
have<00:05:07.330> light<00:05:07.540> weight<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:07.870> therefore<00:05:08.110> it's<00:05:08.440> a

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
have light weight and therefore it's a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.690 
have light weight and therefore it's a
second<00:05:08.770> drop<00:05:08.920> and<00:05:09.040> you'll<00:05:09.160> be<00:05:09.310> wearing<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.580> lot

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
second drop and you'll be wearing a lot

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.580 
second drop and you'll be wearing a lot
faster<00:05:10.120> so<00:05:10.450> aim<00:05:10.630> down<00:05:10.810> sight<00:05:11.020> really<00:05:11.170> quickly

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
faster so aim down sight really quickly

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.230 
faster so aim down sight really quickly
it's<00:05:11.680> quite<00:05:11.920> important<00:05:12.340> as<00:05:12.430> well<00:05:12.670> let's<00:05:13.120> go

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
it's quite important as well let's go

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.030 
it's quite important as well let's go

do I have another idea for the best

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.820 
do I have another idea for the best
class<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:49.510> for<00:05:49.630> this<00:05:49.720> weapon<00:05:49.900> and<00:05:50.290> it's<00:05:50.530> using

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
class so for this weapon and it's using

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.740 
class so for this weapon and it's using
dual<00:05:51.190> wield<00:05:51.490> with<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.850> cup<00:05:52.060> for<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.270> lot<00:05:52.480> I<00:05:52.510> see<00:05:52.720> a

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
dual wield with a cup for a lot I see a

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.240 
dual wield with a cup for a lot I see a
lot<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:52.930> people<00:05:53.200> doing<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.530> but<00:05:53.860> as<00:05:53.950> I<00:05:53.980> haven't

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
lot of people doing it but as I haven't

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.280 
lot of people doing it but as I haven't
unlocked<00:05:54.820> it<00:05:55.060> yet<00:05:55.210> because<00:05:55.330> more<00:05:55.600> rock<00:05:55.870> 9<00:05:56.110> with

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
unlocked it yet because more rock 9 with

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.730 
unlocked it yet because more rock 9 with
this<00:05:56.410> weapon

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
this weapon

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.380 
this weapon
I<00:05:56.860> actually<00:05:57.190> think<00:05:57.490> doing<00:05:57.730> would<00:05:57.850> work<00:05:58.120> really

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
I actually think doing would work really

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.670

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
comment section below and I think the

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.680 
comment section below and I think the
scholarships<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:18.970> guys<00:06:19.120> are<00:06:19.270> trying<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.570> do

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
scholarships you guys are trying to do

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.840 
scholarships you guys are trying to do
this<00:06:19.930> like<00:06:20.140> the<00:06:20.290> UAV<00:06:20.680> car<00:06:20.920> UAV<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.670> maybe

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
this like the UAV car UAV and maybe

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.550 
this like the UAV car UAV and maybe
lightning<00:06:22.240> strike<00:06:22.450> something<00:06:22.810> small<00:06:23.140> now<00:06:23.500> you

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
lightning strike something small now you

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.440 
lightning strike something small now you
can<00:06:23.770> get<00:06:23.950> you<00:06:24.100> unseen<00:06:24.730> around<00:06:25.030> them<00:06:25.150> up<00:06:25.270> and

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
can get you unseen around them up and

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.940 
can get you unseen around them up and
also<00:06:25.600> get<00:06:25.960> you<00:06:26.080> killed<00:06:26.350> because<00:06:26.650> you<00:06:26.740> guys

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
also get you killed because you guys

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.260 
also get you killed because you guys
know<00:06:27.100> you<00:06:27.160> don't<00:06:27.460> have<00:06:27.610> ghosts<00:06:27.910> on<00:06:28.120> and

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
know you don't have ghosts on and

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.430 
know you don't have ghosts on and
therefore<00:06:28.420> you<00:06:28.630> might<00:06:28.780> get<00:06:28.930> seen<00:06:29.110> around<00:06:29.350> them

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
therefore you might get seen around them

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.170 
therefore you might get seen around them
up<00:06:29.530> a<00:06:29.620> little<00:06:29.770> bit<00:06:29.890> more<00:06:30.220> but<00:06:30.610> if<00:06:30.670> you<00:06:30.760> have<00:06:30.880> car

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
up a little bit more but if you have car

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.640 
up a little bit more but if you have car
you<00:06:31.420> if<00:06:31.540> you're<00:06:31.720> on<00:06:31.780> therefore<00:06:31.960> you<00:06:32.140> can<00:06:32.320> no

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
you if you're on therefore you can no

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.900 
you if you're on therefore you can no
but<00:06:32.890> enemies<00:06:33.190> mean<00:06:33.370> them<00:06:33.490> up<00:06:33.580> and<00:06:33.730> therefore

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
but enemies mean them up and therefore

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.910 
but enemies mean them up and therefore
you<00:06:34.090> don't<00:06:34.150> get<00:06:34.360> seen<00:06:34.570> me

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920

I'm picking up kills you know like I

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.880 
I'm picking up kills you know like I
said<00:06:36.840> this<00:06:36.960> weapon<00:06:37.230> doesn't<00:06:37.470> have<00:06:37.560> damage

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
said this weapon doesn't have damage

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.530 
said this weapon doesn't have damage
Rico<00:06:38.220> so<00:06:38.370> getting<00:06:38.550> kills<00:06:38.820> with<00:06:39.030> it<00:06:39.150> should

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
Rico so getting kills with it should

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.850 
Rico so getting kills with it should
have<00:06:39.630> been<00:06:39.690> too<00:06:39.930> hard<00:06:40.200> if<00:06:40.350> you<00:06:40.470> weren't<00:06:40.740> trying

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
have been too hard if you weren't trying

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.470 
have been too hard if you weren't trying
to<00:06:40.980> get<00:06:41.070> long<00:06:41.340> shots<00:06:41.580> you<00:06:41.880> should<00:06:41.910> be<00:06:42.150> too<00:06:42.300> hot

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
to get long shots you should be too hot

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.600 
to get long shots you should be too hot
because<00:06:42.510> the<00:06:42.870> recoil<00:06:43.080> is<00:06:43.380> quite<00:06:43.440> low<00:06:43.950> see<00:06:44.520> I

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
because the recoil is quite low see I

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.920 
because the recoil is quite low see I
