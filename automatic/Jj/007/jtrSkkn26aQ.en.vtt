00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and how very good I am packard myself 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.429
 we are in a new video so that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.290
 to make a trap for whatever 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.910
 for me in this case not 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.910
 and it's very simple though 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.869
 there are some people who told him and not the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.380
 they know how to do but it's very easy you have to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.610
 catch 4 is worth these 4 here in the middle and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.960
 draw a circle around 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 so it should be like this then in each 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.090
 corner do one more down 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:48.790
 and you put reston torches here 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.680
 another one here here and another one here I'm going 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.829
 to see what life is a bit that has 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.280
 to be loading the map 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.500
 that charges a little worth 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 once we have this opposite we put 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 here 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.230
 in the spaces that remain like this for 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.700
 above 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.370
 so these we give to the east block and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.060
 climb to a block a piston mahle the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.060
 activated piston 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.310
 well in the four corners 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.229
 ok and here in the middle only makes us 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.229
 missing the four people plate 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.640
 as you see if he tried to leave I can not 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.040
 go out 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 because before now because it's high 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.390
 but these will not be able to leave 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.980
 but just in case I recommend taking 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.360
 stone and do 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.150
 well two tall 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.890
 and trace is the same square that you have 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.890
 done but up here 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.810
 OK 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.460
 and now I will not be able to leave 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.320
 because if they jump they stick here but there's a 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.130
 trick for us that if we go 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 jumping 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.000
 you have to go trying 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 over here you see now you have to give to 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.220
 jump and every time go more to one side and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.220
 at the end you are out look 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.409
 we give him 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 you do not see it now we have already left this way 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.909
 easy and good this has been everything I hope 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.430
 that you liked to like 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.780
