sycamore<00:00:14.870> you<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:16.020> notice<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
sycamore you can notice that the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.200 
sycamore you can notice that the
heartwood<00:00:16.980> area<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.460> tree<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> completely

heartwood area that tree is completely

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
heartwood area that tree is completely
decayed<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> gone<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.740> pretty<00:00:19.980> much<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
decayed and gone it's pretty much a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.960 
decayed and gone it's pretty much a
fossil<00:00:20.699> wood<00:00:20.869> just<00:00:21.869> nothing<00:00:22.320> left<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.039> this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
fossil wood just nothing left to it this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.720 
fossil wood just nothing left to it this
is<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.300> dead<00:00:24.570> tissue<00:00:24.869> anyway<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> tree

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
is all dead tissue anyway where the tree

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.240 
is all dead tissue anyway where the tree
actually<00:00:26.939> grows<00:00:27.720> new<00:00:28.019> wood<00:00:28.230> around<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.769> then

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
actually grows new wood around it then

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.130 
actually grows new wood around it then
you<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.550> into<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> sapwood<00:00:30.150> area<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.929> which

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
you get into the sapwood area here which

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
you get into the sapwood area here which
was<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.800> two-thirds<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.669> gone<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.120> well

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
was is two-thirds the way gone as well

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
was is two-thirds the way gone as well
and<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.590> these<00:00:34.710> areas<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.280> here

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and you get into these areas out here

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.100 
and you get into these areas out here
where<00:00:35.670> you're<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.940> your<00:00:36.149> bark<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:36.960> your

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
where you're at your bark and then your

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.619 
where you're at your bark and then your
vascular<00:00:37.530> system<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.129> your<00:00:38.250> cambian<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
vascular system of your cambian now you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
vascular system of your cambian now you
can<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:39.960> whats<00:00:40.170> app<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.620> area<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.950> left<00:00:41.219> in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
can see whats app what area is left in

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.229 
can see whats app what area is left in
the<00:00:41.489> tree<00:00:41.730> less<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.809> two<00:00:43.020> inches<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:45.090> can

the tree less than two inches you can

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
the tree less than two inches you can
see<00:00:45.450> how<00:00:46.969> parting<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.180> topping<00:00:48.899> trees<00:00:49.399> causes

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
see how parting or topping trees causes

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.939 
see how parting or topping trees causes
internal<00:00:50.760> damage<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> cavity<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
internal damage and like a cavity in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.029 
internal damage and like a cavity in
your<00:00:53.190> tooth<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.820> decays<00:00:54.510> downward<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> this

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
your tooth it decays downward and this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.380 
your tooth it decays downward and this
is<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.340> happens<00:00:56.670> over<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> period<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.449> time

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
is what happens over a period of time

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.970 
is what happens over a period of time
and<00:00:58.840> you<00:00:58.960> end<00:00:59.079> up<00:00:59.230> with<00:00:59.380> a<00:00:59.410> structurally

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
and you end up with a structurally

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.790 
and you end up with a structurally
unsafe<00:01:00.340> tree<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.630> to<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.930> naked<00:01:02.110> eye<00:01:02.380> because

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
unsafe tree and to the naked eye because

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.619 
unsafe tree and to the naked eye because
there's<00:01:03.010> leaves<00:01:03.250> still<00:01:03.550> left<00:01:03.760> on<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.059> tree<00:01:04.360> it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
there's leaves still left on the tree it

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.530 
there's leaves still left on the tree it
looks<00:01:05.530> like<00:01:05.680> it's<00:01:05.860> fine<00:01:06.159> but<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.180> be<00:01:07.210> able<00:01:07.330> to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
looks like it's fine but to be able to

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.560 
looks like it's fine but to be able to
identify<00:01:07.690> this<00:01:08.310> by<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> visual<00:01:09.820> inspection<00:01:09.970> on

identify this by a visual inspection on

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.960 
identify this by a visual inspection on
the<00:01:10.780> exterior<00:01:11.320> portion<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.070> tree<00:01:12.310> you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
the exterior portion of the tree you

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.719 
the exterior portion of the tree you
have<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.330> know<00:01:13.360> what<00:01:13.930> you're<00:01:13.960> looking<00:01:14.380> for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have to know what you're looking for

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.920 
have to know what you're looking for
some<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.910> loss<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.180> came<00:01:16.570> out<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
some of the loss that came out of the

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.200 
some of the loss that came out of the
lower<00:01:17.110> section<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.830> tree<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.820> can<00:01:19.000> see

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
lower section of the tree you can see

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.700 
lower section of the tree you can see
that<00:01:19.240> there's<00:01:19.660> nothing<00:01:19.810> left<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> world

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
that there's nothing left to the world

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
that there's nothing left to the world
of<00:01:20.950> what<00:01:21.220> has<00:01:21.340> just<00:01:21.369> clearly<00:01:22.360> rotted<00:01:22.780> away

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 

and<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.130> looked<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and this is what it looked like on the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.999 
and this is what it looked like on the
outside<00:01:26.850> nice<00:01:27.570> clean<00:01:27.840> white<00:01:28.140> smooth<00:01:28.560> bark<00:01:28.829> as

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
outside nice clean white smooth bark as

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
outside nice clean white smooth bark as
a<00:01:29.040> California<00:01:29.610> signal<00:01:29.939> more<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.450> but

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
a California signal more would be but

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.880 
a California signal more would be but
the<00:01:31.259> center<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> tree<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.520 

but<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.640> left<00:01:40.909> here<00:01:41.150> is<00:01:41.300> about<00:01:41.540> inches

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
but you have left here is about inches

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.300 
but you have left here is about inches
mass<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:43.460> South<00:01:43.940> wood<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.420> ass

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
mass of South wood and ass

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.820 
mass of South wood and ass
and<00:01:45.460> why<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.939> tree<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.420> still

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
and why the tree is still

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.010 
and why the tree is still
college<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.390> no<00:01:48.540> structural

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
support to the tree over here we have

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
support to the tree over here we have
another<00:01:52.290> log<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.220> bit

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
another log that was a little bit

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.210 
another log that was a little bit
further<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.330> tree<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.010> see

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
further up in the tree and you can see

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.040 
further up in the tree and you can see
this<00:01:56.430> section<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.970> here<00:01:57.270> looks<00:01:57.660> like<00:01:57.870> its

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
this section in here looks like its

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.820 
this section in here looks like its
decay<00:01:58.700> actually<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:01.530> runs

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
decay actually what this is is a runs

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.580

what<00:03:12.060> makes<00:03:12.330> these<00:03:12.540> trees<00:03:13.050> dangerous<00:03:13.890> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
what makes these trees dangerous and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.020 
what makes these trees dangerous and
hazardous<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.290> get<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.280> lot<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
hazardous is that a you get a lot of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.570 
hazardous is that a you get a lot of
moisture<00:03:18.240> you<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.900> bees<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:20.160> rodents

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
moisture you have bees and rodents

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.210 
moisture you have bees and rodents
nesting<00:03:21.270> in<00:03:21.390> them<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:22.830> get<00:03:22.980> closer

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
nesting in them but as we get closer

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.480 
nesting in them but as we get closer
into<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.580> warmer<00:03:24.000> seasons<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
into the warmer seasons and we have a

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.940 
into the warmer seasons and we have a
lot<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.880> heat<00:03:27.300> these<00:03:27.720> trees<00:03:28.080> suck<00:03:28.350> in<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.590> lot<00:03:28.800> of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
lot of heat these trees suck in a lot of

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.770 
lot of heat these trees suck in a lot of
water<00:03:29.160> which<00:03:29.520> creates<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.120> canopy<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> foliage

water which creates a canopy of foliage
and<00:03:31.410> they<00:03:31.950> need<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.430> moisture<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.910> cool

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and they need that moisture to cool

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.140 
and they need that moisture to cool
themselves<00:03:33.450> down<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.200> desiccation
