00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
the sixth minute going into this game I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.740

thought<00:03:22.100> Milan<00:03:22.430> we're<00:03:22.580> gonna<00:03:22.700> really<00:03:23.390> put<00:03:23.660> up

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
thought Milan we're gonna really put up

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.440 
thought Milan we're gonna really put up
a<00:03:23.900> hell<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.739> challenge<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.310> back<00:03:25.549> but

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
a hell of a challenge at the back but

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.210 
a hell of a challenge at the back but
obviously<00:03:26.630> not<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:27.200> we<00:03:27.320> score<00:03:27.650> in<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.950> sixth

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
obviously not as we score in the sixth

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.120 
obviously not as we score in the sixth
minute<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.640> they<00:03:29.000> look<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.420> make<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.840> 1-1<00:03:30.440> so

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
minute and they look to make it 1-1 so

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.920 
minute and they look to make it 1-1 so
close<00:03:31.430> i<00:03:31.640> was<00:03:31.670> really<00:03:32.000> risking<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.600> there<00:03:32.750> as

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
close i was really risking it there as
