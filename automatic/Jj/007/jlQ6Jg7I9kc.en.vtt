 Mustard hyogo cream in four 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 minutes to do then our pelÃ© 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.570
 of chicken 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.010

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:34.290
 yogurtes natural parsley 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 in the refrigerator to make it easier to 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:44.600
 little beating salt pepper our mustards 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:51.570
 smooth and our oil 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:57.500
 Let's start, so ball was an oil. 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.500
 it's already in the chicken here salt 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:09.450
 this one is already the salt of the recipe then 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:15.860
 Look, we'll use theft. 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.860
 one in which 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:30.760
 and this here gives us a good mix 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.210
 and you're going to get away from it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.990
 I'll leave it gilding three minutes of each 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.600
 side 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.369
 we've already worked chicken the three 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.310
 minutes on each side of a golden boa 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.619
 on both sides and that we do 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 when it is not ready there is a danger 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.190
 Like chile for cam and we'll leave it 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.259
 them the pot with water because I do not 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.440
 I put here neither lemon nor saw anything like 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.220
 Grandpa yo-yo likes me working lemon or 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:18.410
 vinegar 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:21.130
 I'm going to bathe the yogurt so water 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.980
 throw the same pan 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.470
 we did a process of creating all 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.709
 the flavors here of the pan do not let go 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.880
 the water gets blurred immediately 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.880
 There we come short. 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.930
 the mustard 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:03:02.500
 gives a stirred O able to get that 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:08.920
 beautiful color and what is going to happen 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:11.099
 cook the chicken here on this wall of a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.150
 motel with mustard 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.659
 it will give a reduced go 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.969
 intensify color for about 10 minutes 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.010
 our chicken then already cooked and one 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.169
 sauce reduced that won the itabom by 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.510

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.579
 beauty best is standing on top of the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.010
 chicken and is by him the second white is 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:35.069
 also the chicken stayed that time 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.069
 Then everything's going to be okay. 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.870
 the chicken in the dish 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.170

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.790
