00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
where some editors perhaps didn't worry

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.080 
where some editors perhaps didn't worry
quite<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.130> whether<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.909> true

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
quite so much about whether it was true

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.560 
quite so much about whether it was true
