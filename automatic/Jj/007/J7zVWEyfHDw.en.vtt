well<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.090> mean<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:55.710> don't<00:02:55.890> see<00:02:56.130> mid-engine

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
well I mean you don't see mid-engine

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.610 
well I mean you don't see mid-engine
drift<00:02:56.880> cars<00:02:57.120> very<00:02:57.300> much<00:02:57.540> obviously<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.380> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
drift cars very much obviously so I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.260 
drift cars very much obviously so I
wanted<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.130> give<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.400> one<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.640> shot<00:02:59.700> because<00:03:00.240> I

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
wanted to give this one a shot because I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.020 
wanted to give this one a shot because I
love<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.020> Audi<00:03:01.200> r8<00:03:01.440> specifically<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.460> v8<00:03:02.850> I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
love the Audi r8 specifically the v8 I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.660 
love the Audi r8 specifically the v8 I
mean<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.360> I've<00:03:04.140> always<00:03:04.590> thought<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.130> v10

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
mean I I've always thought that the v10

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.970 
mean I I've always thought that the v10
since<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.570> similar<00:03:07.050> since<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.650> that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
since it's so similar since that that

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.830 
since it's so similar since that that
since<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.250> engine<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.910> pretty<00:03:09.150> much<00:03:09.300> since

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
since that engine is pretty much since

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.200 
since that engine is pretty much since
the<00:03:09.930> v10<00:03:10.470> engine<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:10.950> pretty<00:03:11.550> much<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.820> Guyardo

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
the v10 engine is pretty much a Guyardo

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.570 
the v10 engine is pretty much a Guyardo
engine<00:03:12.720> why<00:03:13.530> not<00:03:13.710> get<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.920> Guyardo

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
engine why not get a Guyardo

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.280 
engine why not get a Guyardo
