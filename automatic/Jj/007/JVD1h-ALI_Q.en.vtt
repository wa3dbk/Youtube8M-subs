00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.010
 i 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.520
 in ancient times the magicians 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.370
 dominated their spells only with the power 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.400
 from the memory to cast a spell 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.310
 it was necessary technology or 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.350
 any difficult beyond the mind of the magician 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.330
 at that time the greatest magicians were 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.970
 those who are awarded the best 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.029
 minds but even marked a moment 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.250
 superior was required to specialize 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.920
 in just one magic school 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.500
 the most dedicated magicians could remember 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.680
 throughout his life of at most 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.229
 four spells but it was like the magicians 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.989
 normal dominate in two or even 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.510
 only one spell and yet this one 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.909
 mage needed to consult early 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.760
 or take to help you remember 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.010
 their spells but within these ancient 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.769
 practicing magic was an exception. 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.619
 a genius intellect and memory that some 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.360
 said to be unlimited that challenged until 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.820
 even the master more than one school 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.210
 magic known at that time as 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 claw when young bottle already dominated 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.400
 spells that even sages could not 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.440
 understands them completely and with 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.320
 mind so extraordinary he got tired 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.590
 of ancient spells and entered the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.300
 magic academy place where magic 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.310
 was taught to anyone who was 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.430
 willing to follow his strict 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.430
 training on the first day of class one 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.020
 former head of admissions 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.860
 understood his name wrong and finished 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.210
 putting calm in the bottle place 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.180
 as he was undergoing a change 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.909
 of life at that moment he decided to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.670
 keep silent and accept your new name 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.220
 the time spent in the gym left the car 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.290
 I was even disappointed to learn new 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 spells he wanted more and more 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.370
 improve both your knowledge and your 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.990
 your spells 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.750
 until one day, one more day 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.580
 Evening at the academy library. 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.370
 he discovered the spell called 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.950
 always not having delivered a spell 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.140
 far from so powerful that say 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.459
 those who used them would have power 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.340
 immortality 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.860
 unless atoms were reduced 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.530
 several of these near-mortals live in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.290
 but secret place or was not already the magician 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.209
 used to hide his gifts in little 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.640
 academy council time all 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.700
 learned what cause he had gotten 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.440
 something that no magician achieved a thousand years ago 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.680
 he had learned spell from 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.959
 immortality betting act council 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.080
 was unanimous and everyone agreed 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.450
 to grant the title of means but with the ego 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.170
 gigantic he still decided to change his 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.690
 name being known as arsenal 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.700
 the magician who contains the greatest sign of magic 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.130
 in your mind all over the world 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.080
 but after an event in which car is not 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.920
 recalls involving the society of 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.319
 members 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.410
 he had to change his name one more time 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.780
 being known until now as an invocation 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.970
 after so long he believes that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.110
 only you are not able to learn more 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.060
 spells 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.500
 but how does he love to show his 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.870
 superiority 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 he goes around looking for battles that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.980
 test in your power
