00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.170
 How about friends of people from Venezuela and 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.170
 Mexico 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.900
 today they 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.900
 I want to share 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.890
 what is ph 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.840
 the ph 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.570
 is the hydrogen potential 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.770
 is a measure of acidity or alkalinity 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.770
 of a dissolution 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 to measure the ph a scale is used 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.630
 from 0 to 14 being the number 7 the ph 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630
 neutral 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.710
 for our beta fish in their aquariums 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.990
 they need 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.530
 a slightly acid ph 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:01.410
 Acid values 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.410
 they are from number 0 to number 6 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.440
 or 7 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:12.520
 the 7 is the neutral 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:17.320
 and the alkaline or basic values are 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.320
 7.5 onwards 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.400
 in the natural habitat of our fish 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 they 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.260
 The proper ph is from 6.8 to 7.2 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.760
 and then this ph must be constant 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.920
 Our fish have better metabolism 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.100
 A better 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.910
 quality of life at these levels of 6.8 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.910
 to 7.2 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.700
 the way to check the ph 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.429
 There are different methods 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.340
 which I have 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.770
 this box of ribbons 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.900
 ph meters 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.250
 as we can see here is on the scale 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.280
 from 0 to 7 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.280
 this is the scale for 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.490
 the acid level 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.490
 and from 7 to 14 that is the alkaline 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.849
 well then 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.970
 we take a 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.970
 a strip 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.970
 indicator 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.950
 we put it here to the aquarium and 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.950
 we wait a moment 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.970
 about five more seconds 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 Then let out 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.970
 the phd to undo this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.240
 between 7 and 8 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.130
 we leave it at 7.5 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.130
 our sales times adapt 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.640
 ph 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.780
 it's slightly a little 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.940
 Well, it 's so normal, but for 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.050
 download it what we can use is a 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.160
 piece of wood 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.160
 this serves to 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.270
 which is said to get a little acidic 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.020
 other fish that he deals with 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.660
 the basic ph what can be done is 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.870
 add 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.550
 this 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.290
 a skeleton of 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.290
 of some coral this 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.530
 to see some hedgehog for example are 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.540
 made of calcium carbonate which is a 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.390
 skeleton of a hedgehog 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:19.420
 this we could use it for 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:22.030
 the fish that occupy the most alkaline ph 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.660
 Well, this is all and I hope 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.980
 serve 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.680
 if you see that the ph is slightly 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.530
 alkaline with a piece of wood 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.830
 also with our almond leaves 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.410
 of guava or banana also helps anything 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.790
 to balance the ph keep it a bit 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.860
 empty 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.030
 well this is all and I hope you like it 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.030
 come thank you
