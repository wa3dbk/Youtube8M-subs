00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.779
 The first thing we are going to do is go to 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.380
 download link that I will leave in the 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.380
 description 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.170
 here we wait for 5 seconds and we give 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.170
 in jumping advertising 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.810
 here we find the files to download 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.779
 are 5 parts of the installer and one of the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.310
 cayenne let's select all the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.760
 boxes and we give right click 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.160
 to download 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.460
 I canceled because I already have all the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.050
 parts once you finish downloading 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.960
 we will have the five parts of the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.400
 installer and one of the key in let's 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.400
 select the five parts 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.930
 we right click on one of the parts 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.930
 and extract here 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.490
 and as you can see we will have the installer of the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.190
 program we go to the program we give 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.970
 right click and we execute it as 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.560
 administrator we give you yes and how 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 can see the window will open 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.140
 installation we will expect it to be 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.240
 download the important files and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.800
 we will begin to install we give in 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.910
 next accept the following terms 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.910
 Typical installation 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580
 following 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.610
 uncheck this box next 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:40.230
 next next next continue 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.930
 Now the only thing we expect is 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.520
 that finished installing is that they 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.620
 I will say the characteristics of this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.750
 workstations program serves to 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.210
 virtualize an operating system within 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.700
 of another virtualize means 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.250
 run in a simulated environment another 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.500
 operating system for example if only 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.630
 you are a windows user and you want 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 learn or practice Linux without spoiling 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.160
 your windows and avoid problems as if 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.720
 formatting is spoiled everything you create a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.570
 virtual machine with vmware workstation 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.480
 you give the path linux dvd and follow 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.430
 the steps on the screen which makes dies 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.290
 workstation is simulate in a window 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.350
 that you have a complete team now with 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 linux during the configuration of the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.640
 virtual machine you have to assign 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.640
 hard disk amount memory if it's going to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.470
 have a DVD reader network and so on 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 requirements to have a machine 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.600
 virtual the most important is to have a 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.180
 good computer with many resources 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.000
 for example if you have a windows 7 with 4 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.520
 gigabytes of ram 500 gigabytes of disk 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 Hard DVD reader and network card and 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840
 you want to virtualize a ubuntu linux to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 create the virtual machine you assign by 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 example 100 gigabytes of the 500 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.110
 gigabytes you have 1 gigabyte of ram 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.300
 of what you have and that you share the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.090
 network card and dvd reader with your 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.160
 machine to virtualize as you could 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.020
 Noticing a good team is required because 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.910
 when allocating resources to a machine 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.460
 these will not be available 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.130
 for the physical machine until you turn off 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.110
 the virtual machine is also compatible 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.540
 with windows and linux operating systems 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.340
 your virtual machines can be 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.410
 covers to any other program 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.270
 virtualization also has a version 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.130
 of vmware for more call water 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.040
 fusion in which we can virtualize 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.900
 Windows operating systems is also 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.000
 highly compatible with machines 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.890
 virtual created in other software 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.190
 virtualization as virtual box or 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.500
 virtual 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.960
 The advantages of vmware workstation is 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 that we can create virtual machines the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.190
 variety of operating systems is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.770
 incredible 600 operating systems 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.840
 different from a windows going through 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.240
 mac doing some virguerÃ­a until all 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.740
 Linux systems the variety of their ubuntu 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.390
 cedh now owed broccoli and so on 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.640
 ability to virtualize up to 2 tm of 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.890
 virtual disks assign up to 8 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 virtual processors per machine u 8 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.170
 cores per machine 64 gigabytes of 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.330
 ram by machine we also have 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.040
 the possibility of connecting in a 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.050
 remote from another computer west map 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.960
 puts without having to access first to 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.820
 the host machine we can connect 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.850
 peripherals directly to the machine 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.250
 virtual as pendrives hard drives cd s 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.350
 wifi antennas and a long etcetera also 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.690
 we have the option to transfer files 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.040
 between the virtual machine and the host 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.040
 clicking and dragging 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.169
 as we can see it is one of the best 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.530
 options to create virtual machines 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.349
 highly recommended this program as we see 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.470
 already finished installing now we 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.120
 will ask for the registration key and for 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.150
 continue let's deactivate our 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.120
 antivirus since some antivirus 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.060
 they detect which gene as virus and not 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.240
 which allow you to start and gene but not 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 worry that there is no virus just what 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.630
 we will use to generate a serial for 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.630
 continue with the installation 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.410
 once the antivirus was disabled 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.870
 we go to the folder where we have 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.450
 downloaded the key gen 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.620
 we are going to decompress it, we click on it 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.620
 right extract here 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.249
 to the extracted file we will execute it as 

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.249
 administrator 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.759
 the key gen will open 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.780
 once here we click on generate 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.490
 then we copy the code we go to the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.490
 installation window and we paste it 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.210
 we click on enter and finalize 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.910
 very well we can close the gene and 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.130
 activate our antivirus if we want the 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.400
 mine will be automatically activated in about 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.400
 minutes
