00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello welcome to the choice of exponents this time we are going to 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:05.970
 work with firefighters 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.270
 that ekin in 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.489
 a smaller rival merit 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.179
 what we call exponents 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879
 this number 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.800
 let's start with a 3 squared 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.919
 this number 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.919
 it was called that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 the number eight and removed that is up 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 it's called an exponent 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.820
 these numbers 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.129
 they indicate us 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.710
 an operation that we have to do 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.050
 It's very common 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.590
 that when we have these numbers 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.350
 let's say 3 compliments 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.460
 It does not matter 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.020
 dare everyone 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.130
 and that is equal to 6 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.270
 this 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 correct spin 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.570
 instead of that when we have 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.890
 3 squared 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.190
 what we have is 3 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.820
 another number 3 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.189
 and that three times three results in a 9 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.130
 let's see some examples that put here 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 to say it if we deal with this 3 to 2 is the example we had before 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 but those voices 3 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 by another number 3 and the result is a 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.650
 observe this number 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.009
 two at 6 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.790
 we could think these portals but not 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.580
 two to six months 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.950
 once 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.010
 two 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.140
 three times 4 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 5 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 six months 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.430
 that is 2 at 6 is 2 multiplied by itself six months 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.490
 how is this a little bit long I'm going to do it 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240
 in three different strict parts first numbers two give us the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.050
 numbers 4 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.700
 here I have two more 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.470
 of the other room 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.200
 I have two others in the other 4 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.519
 when multiplied now it is four times this 4 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.519
 -16 put four miles 64 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.549
 I have 64 there 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.719
 let's see let's do it one by one 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.680
 two 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.639
 by two is a four 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.510
 by two is an 8 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.499
 borgos 13 and 16 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.449
 by dose 32 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.489
 for 12 64 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.409
 then two of the six venues 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.079
 64 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.549
 let's do now is that 50 3 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.450
 5 3 without which it appears without confusion as per 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.329
 5 for 5 nothing 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.629
 25 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.779
 on the other without eating at 125 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.839
 let's do three other examples that put here 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.309
 now I have is from 4 to 3 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.489
 4 to 3 6 4 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.889
 for four 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.359
 for four 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.719
 the base is 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.159
 4 three times the base three months 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.200
 Estevez four times four 16 times four 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.099
 64 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.200
 the base of this number moves 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.670
 how many times twice because I sign up 9 times 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.969
 nine by majorities 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.999
 81 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.449
 let's see this 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.819
 we will work on this example 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.009
 same 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.749
 days cubed is 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.299
 goods 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.109
 for goods 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.469
 for goods 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.879
 Remind yourself that every time there are multiply the number by cheerful diego 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.089
 won 0 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.489
 10 for 10 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.899
 essien 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:45.319
 if the per day the fmi 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.679
 so 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:49.009
 DÃ­ez to the cube is a 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.319
 thousand 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.719
 for now 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.909
 The only thing we are doing is identifying how many times I am going to 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.609
 multiply the base 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.239
 by the exponent 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.389
 I hope the idea already 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.559
 been of use of this election 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.589
 see you in the next thanks
