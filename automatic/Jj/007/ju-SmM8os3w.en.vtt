00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
bed it's okay to make the sand bed stack

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.630 
bed it's okay to make the sand bed stack
like<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.380> rocks<00:01:43.829> themselves<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like that but the rocks themselves it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.330 
like that but the rocks themselves it
just<00:01:44.820> looks<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.479> purposeful<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> every<00:01:47.130> tank

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
just looks so purposeful and every tank

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
just looks so purposeful and every tank
looks<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:47.820> when<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> stack<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> rocks

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
looks the same when you stack the rocks

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
looks the same when you stack the rocks
like<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> lot<00:01:50.220> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like that so you want to have a lot of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.670 
like that so you want to have a lot of
nooks<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.090> crannies<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.780> caves<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.500> want

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
nooks and crannies and caves you want

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.319 
nooks and crannies and caves you want
the<00:01:52.770> fish<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.950> feel<00:01:53.280> secure<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> also

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the fish to feel secure but you also

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.030 
the fish to feel secure but you also
want<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> create<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.079> much<00:01:55.229> open<00:01:55.649> space<00:01:55.680> as

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
want to create as much open space as

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
want to create as much open space as
possible<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.000> reason<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
possible and the reason for this is to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
possible and the reason for this is to
allow<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> water<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> move<00:01:59.130> freely<00:01:59.369> through

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
allow the water to move freely through

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.819 
allow the water to move freely through
the<00:01:59.759> tank<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.630> keep<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> waste<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the tank and keep a lot of the waste in

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.070 
the tank and keep a lot of the waste in
suspension<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> filter<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.329> at<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
suspension so the filter can get at it

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.810 
suspension so the filter can get at it
if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.710> too<00:02:04.920> much<00:02:05.040> decorations<00:02:05.700> in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
if you have too much decorations in

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
if you have too much decorations in
there<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.300> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.510> really<00:02:06.810> impede<00:02:07.260> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
there it's going to really impede the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.300 
there it's going to really impede the
water<00:02:07.590> flow<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.570> have<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.800> relying<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.010> more

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
water flow and have you relying on more

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
water flow and have you relying on more
pumps<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:12.300> equipment<00:02:12.600> more<00:02:12.780> electricity<00:02:13.320> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
pumps more equipment more electricity to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
pumps more equipment more electricity to
move<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.950> water<00:02:14.130> around<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.450> doesn't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
move that water around and it doesn't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.120 
move that water around and it doesn't
really<00:02:15.810> serve<00:02:16.050> much<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.410> purpose<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.920> don't

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
really serve much of a purpose you don't

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.260 
really serve much of a purpose you don't
want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> put<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.550> lot<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> rocks<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.150> there

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
want to put a lot of rocks in there

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.060 
want to put a lot of rocks in there
there's<00:02:18.870> such<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> thing<00:02:19.200> called<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.650> golden

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
there's such a thing called a golden

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.750 
there's such a thing called a golden
ratio

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
ratio

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.450 
ratio
where<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.960> like<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> 4/3<00:02:22.740> proportion

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
where you have like a 4/3 proportion

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.010 
where you have like a 4/3 proportion
where<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.820> rocks<00:02:24.060> are<00:02:24.240> stacked<00:02:24.480> higher<00:02:24.810> on

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
where the rocks are stacked higher on

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.660 
where the rocks are stacked higher on
one<00:02:25.200> side<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.800> they<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> other<00:02:26.370> side

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
one side and they are on the other side

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.150 
one side and they are on the other side
and<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:26.940> ratio<00:02:27.450> works<00:02:27.900> well<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.500> lot<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and that ratio works well for a lot of a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.680 
and that ratio works well for a lot of a
lot<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.520> people<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.600> actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
lot of people you can you can actually

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.080 
lot of people you can you can actually
google<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.460> sand<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
google that and then the sand or the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
google that and then the sand or the
gravel<00:02:33.570> substrate<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> nice<00:02:34.860> fine<00:02:35.220> sand

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
gravel substrate I like a nice fine sand

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.430 
gravel substrate I like a nice fine sand
but<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.330> too<00:02:36.570> fine<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.320> get

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
but if it's too fine it's going to get

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.200 
but if it's too fine it's going to get
blown<00:02:37.680> around<00:02:37.860> by<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> current<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> want

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
blown around by the current so you want

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.510 
blown around by the current so you want
to<00:02:39.300> sand<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:39.750> got<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> granular<00:02:40.920> size<00:02:41.190> large

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
to sand that's got a granular size large

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.190 
to sand that's got a granular size large
enough<00:02:41.610> where<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> doesn't<00:02:42.330> blow<00:02:42.480> around<00:02:42.600> but

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
enough where it doesn't blow around but

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.720 
enough where it doesn't blow around but
not<00:02:43.290> too<00:02:43.590> big<00:02:43.800> where<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.100> looks<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.340> rocks

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
not too big where it looks like rocks

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610 
not too big where it looks like rocks
and<00:02:44.970> salt<00:02:45.270> water<00:02:45.360> chlorine<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.170> days<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and salt water chlorine the days of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.010 
and salt water chlorine the days of
using<00:02:46.770> crushed<00:02:47.130> coral<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:47.970> are<00:02:48.090> gone<00:02:48.270> it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
using crushed coral I think are gone it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.390 
using crushed coral I think are gone it
just<00:02:49.080> doesn't<00:02:49.530> look<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.800> good<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> nice

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
just doesn't look as good as a nice

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.570 
just doesn't look as good as a nice
