I got both of them and the MSF's are
really<00:03:02.459> really<00:03:02.669> nice<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> only<00:03:03.239> problem

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
really really nice but the only problem

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.490 
really really nice but the only problem
is<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.620> collection<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.069> super-sized<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
is this collection is super-sized so the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.479 
is this collection is super-sized so the
MSF's<00:03:08.069> are<00:03:08.389> huge<00:03:09.389> but<00:03:09.750> they're<00:03:09.989> expensive<00:03:10.489> one

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
MSF's are huge but they're expensive one

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.140 
MSF's are huge but they're expensive one
msf<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.200> $42<00:03:13.200> Canadian<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:14.430> cannot<00:03:14.669> justify

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
msf is $42 Canadian and I cannot justify

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.719 
msf is $42 Canadian and I cannot justify
spending<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.659> much<00:03:15.870> money<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.229> powder

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:16.729 
spending that much money on a powder

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.219 
spending that much money on a powder
they're<00:03:17.729> really<00:03:18.000> pretty<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.109> the
