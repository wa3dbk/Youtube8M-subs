00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 it would be boys drinking wine in the new 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.700
 video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 today we are pathetic tired and we say that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.490
 a new inaugural let's play ie more 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.769
 that the expenses was a tutorial that precisely 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.440
 naural cats because from now on the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.529
 video is the video the channel will not be 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 more mine alone but also vg andria with 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.180
 which I am working more on 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 this tutorial is not this point 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 tutorial will talk about let's say dribbles 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.210
 barbs and even rabbons in a new one 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.989
 move is welcome we will tell you later 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.379
 even the bicycle 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.559
 now that it's time to remember it well 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.539
 let's start right away with dribbles i 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.170
 dribbles are made by pressing lt prb is there 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.170
 these keys 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 let's see how to go, here's where 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.409
 always press that if you have to keep it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.299
 pressed to over depress rb with one 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.369
 a certain constancy, that is, a nanny- type, like this 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.650
 now putting ls down like this 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:25.310
 always holding we will have some t 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 you can pretty upside it here it is or 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.610
 sforbiciano sforbiciano in fact of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.350
 this I want you to see some i 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.350
 replay but the sisters will be fine 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.189
 here is that new session 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.210
 no this is the right scissor that has 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:56.259
 made the kitchens as you can 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.009
 see what you put the ball up at all times 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.659
 doing the dribbles the ball is raised there 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.689
 takes with the knee and again 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:10.629
 continues to dribble and then if there 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:17.230
 get up and do a half a cut here 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:20.440
 coming out around taking a projector 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.860
 an effect at 0 for a spin effect e 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.569
 then marking in the left corner 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.360
 bass 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.810
 ok here quo a dinner upside down I have 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.430
 personally called kakÃ  that I did 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.220
 I 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.019
 do neither cousins vincenzo which is one 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:45.640
 reversed that if it is good that there is that 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:49.780
 what happens is that messes do juggles if 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.470
 the evening as always at home and if one 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.000
 more crusade that is upturned straight to 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.030
 one does not get around 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.269
 no today the type with a lob and a stick e 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.299
 al par has held up and therefore possesses 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:11.769
 displaced can do nothing 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:16.120
 now you have to give up training you are now 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.989
 we want to see the bicycle 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.209
 then the bike is very easy 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:31.569
 these buttons must be pressed ltd 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:33.910
 these pool sartini e lt e adele when 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.639
 if you want to do the bicycle for example 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.079
 normal is the normal bicycle 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.020
 you have to make a top 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.710
 you have to make a nice touch 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.840
 long, that is, at this point as logical 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.510
 fast remember one down and two in 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.430
 as high as when in this case that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.530
 they make fallen here is this 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.090
 normal bicycle then there was the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.040
 be it bicycle television 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.550
 advanced bicycle 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.400
 but this gem these bicycles 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.630
 advanced it is a little bit more difficult 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.540
 normal and is done by always pressing a 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.270
 button once at the bottom found in the car 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:23.489
 but with more slowly and see is so 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.489
 one no so and the thermal pool 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.640
 here I will understand should come out that 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.180
 instead of doing they are a touch of raco 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.150
 he does two things, however, where he must 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.640
 do you have to press down once and 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.640
 after one second in art after another 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:48.160
 Seconds known is easy there is more difficult 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.460
 bad navigator but ok now we would like 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.550
 see a true love that we leap of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.280
 penguin move the nib which consists 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.290
 in pressing letters and click 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.990
 click and click to press that 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.160
 house in which the pall is raised 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.010
 the ball and you can not so I do it 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.560
 also to say to the register I don't work or 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:18.210
 you can pull an ace of his land 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.210
 as much as you want 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.430
 and then then we will have a lot of trickery 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.970
 difficult to ip phone that you do not do the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.259
 first shot but it takes a wind you know 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.729
 which consists of the good one from the bona 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:40.800
 It would be a little expensive all the truant 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:45.030
 however it is not a good one does not consist in 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.000
 pull consists in the plus and the crosses that 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.479
 in pulling just ass go he managed to 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.909
 Mark 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:06:01.770
 yes just by luck and you have to do this 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:06:07.470
 perfect understanding how to do it by receiving lt 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:13.819
 and the most lb which then for which l tpl 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:17.340
 b then if you have a classic joystick 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:20.610
 you have to press hicks which consists of 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:29.370
 cross and if you have an alternative one like 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:35.430
 mine you have to click on then and then 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:37.349
 take the right diagonal hill 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:43.320
 Chinese are in art in the upper left 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:46.540
 always if you're going left where 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:52.830
 of pointing right is so 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:58.060
 and vice versa so in this way as 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:07:01.420
 so it's out there, it's very easy there 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.150
 here for example now has not come out because 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:13.500
 I went too fast ahead and 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:17.380
 so you are not press mode is output 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:20.860
 out the most basic keys 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:23.740
 important and fundamental to make i 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.870
 tricks and tricks would be lt da 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.070
 always press because otherwise these 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:35.950
 tricks wouldn't come out not 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:38.740
 would succeed and therefore indeed if you and 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:44.920
 if you want you can only use elf of long 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:47.470
 of the ball here is there will be long e 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.540
 therefore they do not come out by pressing 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:59.830
 elective hi fi see here we create ourselves 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:08:03.100
 only that it is so and bovid so it is finished 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.820
 the first episode of the tutorial will come out 

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:11.410
 of course other tutorials on veroli 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:14.380
 which is so so nothing is over and there 

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:17.310
 salute and a next episode 

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.310
 hello everyone hello
