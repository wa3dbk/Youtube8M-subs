 I know it's a little boring to 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.840
 You who are accustomed to watching video 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.209

 continuity to a video just to not 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.360
 to ignore what is good for us already 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:07.310
 It's over here, we 're going to 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:09.650
 folder from where the game was extracted beauty 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.269

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.579

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.680

 Do you want a guy who is very wise and 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.740
 smart are you going to do it that way 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.389
 because I know if you want to save time and with 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.220
 This ends up getting an error back. 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.580

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:39.400

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.540
 we can repair it until the icon that 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.150
 changed but before restarting the game 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.070
 People are going to come here, configuration 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.070

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.070
 OK 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.200
 Pretty good there, you do not have to do it. 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.080
 in no way automatically or automatically 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:15.870
 be a play a game a pot that 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:18.920
 it seems easy and intuitive only 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.920
 wait for the game 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:32.800
 let's click play on line it's garbage 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.140
 the arrow list and notice that the servers 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.280
 They are all here but I've received here 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.280
 to show you 're working 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:46.290
 particularly these new files 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.970
 They are better than the current right 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.460
 earlier saying that in the way 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.990
 which was a bit heavier it looks like 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.240
 the loading screen a delay a 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.770
 little until game start 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.770
 in my view it's a case 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:16.330
 motonline ee servers mbr a good 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.810

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.960

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.550
 night and Delhi 6 they did is 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.340

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:44.530
 to be released that is ultimately what 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.539
 want to download dlc to play feel me 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.919
