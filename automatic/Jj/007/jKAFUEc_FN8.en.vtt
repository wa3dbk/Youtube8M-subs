00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
these and you adjust so that the water

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.069 
these and you adjust so that the water
goes<00:00:41.270> into<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.940> certain<00:00:44.940> location<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.899> in

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
goes into on a certain location and I in

to get into Japan now you have to get 25

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.880 
to get into Japan now you have to get 25
of<00:00:51.570> these<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.870> water<00:00:52.050> droplets<00:00:52.140> inside<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
of these little water droplets inside of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
of these little water droplets inside of
a<00:00:52.949> pot<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.460> win<00:00:53.910> ink<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.270> very<00:00:54.449> complex<00:00:54.809> they

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
a pot to win ink it's very complex they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.250 
a pot to win ink it's very complex they
had<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.379> many<00:00:55.500> different<00:00:55.770> features<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.460> use

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
had so many different features to use

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.510 
had so many different features to use
some<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> these<00:00:58.410> puzzles<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.920> other<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
some of these puzzles that other really

complex and it takes a really good

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.139 
complex and it takes a really good
graphics<00:01:01.710> processor<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> because

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
graphics processor to do this because

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
graphics processor to do this because
each<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> these<00:01:03.660> old<00:01:03.899> things<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> know

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
each of these old things like you know

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.859 
each of these old things like you know
how<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.430> bouncing<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.150> each<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
how you see I was bouncing off each of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
how you see I was bouncing off each of
those<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.229> add<00:01:07.380> separate<00:01:08.070> math<00:01:08.250> equations

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
those just add separate math equations

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.580 
those just add separate math equations
calculated<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.570> none<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> bounce<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
calculated and none of the bounce of the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
calculated and none of the bounce of the
same<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> preacher<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> animations

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
same it's not a preacher on animations

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
same it's not a preacher on animations
based<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> tilt<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
based on the way you tilt it that's the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800 
based on the way you tilt it that's the
way<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> droplets<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
way that the droplets will go like if it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.940 
way that the droplets will go like if it
hits<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> ground<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> go

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
hits the ground so I just going to go

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
hits the ground so I just going to go
straight<00:01:16.979> down<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> bounce<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
straight down kind of bounce and like I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
straight down kind of bounce and like I
said<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:25.020> add<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.680> these<00:01:25.950> really

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
said they add these really these really

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.319 
said they add these really these really
um<00:01:26.549> complex<00:01:27.479> parts<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.049> these<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:29.240> don't<00:01:30.240> even

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
um complex parts like these I don't even

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.950 
um complex parts like these I don't even
know<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:32.150> I'm<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.689> there

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
know what this is I'm like see if there

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.120 
know what this is I'm like see if there
were<00:01:34.049> different<00:01:34.409> ways<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> tilt<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
were different ways that you tilt it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.740 
were different ways that you tilt it
affect<00:01:36.710> how<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.610> water<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> react

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.060 

you<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.110> close<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> reactive

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
you put it up close is going to reactive

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
you put it up close is going to reactive
when<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.880> particles<00:01:45.509> occur<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
when you see a little particles occur in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
when you see a little particles occur in
different<00:01:45.840> ways<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.770> takes<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.340> good

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
