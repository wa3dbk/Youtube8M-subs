00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.470
 what is the right base machine for the n-ergie harvesting 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.140
 Albrecht Eichholz Forstunternehmer has been phased out for the 4 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.219
 decided 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 his ponies are Bachelot Ural he rests with during the summer months 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.659
 Energy harvesting wood 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:25.659
 In order to keep the investment costs low, he has against an expensive how 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.829
 best aggregate with rich function decided 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.910
 his choice fell on the cost-effective energy Holzwickede 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.690
 Typical uses for the fund Entrepreneurs are the free cutting of 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.790
 overgrown backstreets 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.790
 Machines because of and from forest roads 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 in the hallways backstreets and various because 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 SID old wood the preface completely off 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.030
 Ruhnke on extension third pair and forehead spotted must divert 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.420
 The view of the crane and the unit is now much better 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.340
 on the way back first use Eichholz also takes stalls left and right 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 to make the machine easier to work with 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.450
 In the dense stands is also the crane is important and the aggregate 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.410
 to be able to do through the stock 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.700
 the frost businessman removes the stalls from top to bottom 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.440
 This increases the amount of light and the visibility on the ground is better 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.700
 with the Dual Krades Bachelot Cannell higher crowns than any Stahr hood 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.560
 suffice 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.180
 recessed streets and machines because of reprocessing oppression 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 separated 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.520
 the folk song Eichholz from the side 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.030
 on forest roads rather prefers the direct loading and hangs frame 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 Extension and third, Rome a few 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.360
 here the space conditions allow the filing in Rome in the basket 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.190
 to unload the federal army leg unit as a grapple 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.330
 the movable suspension of the cutting edge is uniform DIHK 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.230
 Eichholz withstands pure energy wood so that for the next hacker and 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.259
 container truck is enough material available 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.929
 the wood chips quality must be votes 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 therefore stronger sections should not be missing 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.989
 at Eichwald, the n-ergie wood inserts with the concert Forwarder 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.089
 adds 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:35.379
 last year to 400 out of a total of 2,300 operating hours
