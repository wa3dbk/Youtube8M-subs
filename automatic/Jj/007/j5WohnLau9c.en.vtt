and we have a little play plastic hammer
here<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:51.580> he<00:04:51.849> pushed<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:52.840> taught<00:04:53.830> him<00:04:53.979> to

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
here and he pushed it I taught him to

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.629 
here and he pushed it I taught him to
hold<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.759> straight<00:04:55.389> very<00:04:55.840> straight<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:57.430> it's

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
hold it straight very straight if it's

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.749 
hold it straight very straight if it's
crooked<00:04:57.849> it<00:04:58.240> doesn't<00:04:58.599> work<00:04:58.750> as<00:04:59.139> you<00:04:59.259> can<00:04:59.440> see

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
crooked it doesn't work as you can see

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.490 
crooked it doesn't work as you can see
he<00:05:00.759> has<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.180> hold<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.449> very<00:05:01.630> straight<00:05:02.169> so<00:05:02.199> this

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
he has to hold it very straight so this

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.200 
he has to hold it very straight so this
is<00:05:02.680> again<00:05:02.919> good<00:05:03.250> pinching<00:05:03.819> practice<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:06.210> at

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
is again good pinching practice and at

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.899 
is again good pinching practice and at
the<00:05:07.360> same<00:05:07.630> time<00:05:07.930> coordination<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.610> hammer

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
the same time coordination the hammer

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.649 
the same time coordination the hammer
has<00:05:10.419> to<00:05:10.569> hit<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.930> top<00:05:11.319> of<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.889> toothpick<00:05:12.789> then

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
has to hit the top of the toothpick then

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.140 
has to hit the top of the toothpick then
once<00:05:13.900> it's<00:05:14.110> like<00:05:14.319> this<00:05:14.560> he<00:05:15.340> can<00:05:15.550> continue<00:05:15.849> and

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
once it's like this he can continue and

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.800 
once it's like this he can continue and
down<00:05:16.930> he<00:05:17.080> goes<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:18.009> the<00:05:18.130> bottom<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.610> cup<00:05:18.810> so

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
down he goes to the bottom of the cup so

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.740 
down he goes to the bottom of the cup so
he'll<00:05:20.020> do<00:05:20.229> like<00:05:20.500> five<00:05:20.770> or<00:05:21.009> six<00:05:21.039> toothpicks<00:05:21.750> and

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
he'll do like five or six toothpicks and

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.909 
he'll do like five or six toothpicks and
then<00:05:23.349> he<00:05:23.710> gets<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.069> see<00:05:24.520> how<00:05:24.759> many<00:05:24.819> he's<00:05:25.210> done

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
then he gets to see how many he's done

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.350 
then he gets to see how many he's done
so<00:05:26.919> he<00:05:27.099> really<00:05:27.340> enjoys<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:27.669> that's<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.180> nice

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:32.649 
rather than switching every cut so he'll

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:35.309
