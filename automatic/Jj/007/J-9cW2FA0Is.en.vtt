00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.589
 space as it is used we are with the 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.589
 very talented 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.560
 let's continue let's do the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 second step of the project we had 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.250
 started last Tuesday we said that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 we are going to do during these four 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.050
 programs the same project that is going to be 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.030
 a wall clock 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 we had done in the first step 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 decoupage and we had prepared the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.540
 basis to continue what it would be in 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.010
 this case 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.980
 the decoupage we had made in the hoop already 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 the seal and we had left prepared 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.740
 with the universal sticker now what 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.680
 What are we going to do? 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.680
 for this as always we are going to take 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.909
 the two white pieces of paper exactly 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.420
 the napkin we are going to make a little bun 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.420
 with this 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.910
 existing in the oil juanita and if 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.140
 learn a lot the juanita also look 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.520
 that there are people who will not have any idea of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.520
 what are you talking about does not matter 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.710
 well let's be mayor 'squat' 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.610
 we support the nylon napkin 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 let's move on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.220
 on nylon a paper cup for 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 fix the napkin and to prevent 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.310
 there are wrinkles and once we did 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.829
 this we are going to give a protective hand 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.530
 with the mode box to leave it ready 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.229
 to continue with the work this is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.820
 so we have to wait for it to dry by 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.080
 I do not give that little chicken love hand 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.679
 now because it has to be very dry 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.350
 Once it is dry , it remains like this if 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.149
 it is dry and has its hand of protection 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.500
 so what we are going to do now is going to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.000
 be apply 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.590
 with a little bit of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.929
 magenta or with the color you like 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.400
 let's make application of successes 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:19.200
 I have these rubber stamps we're going to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.370
 support on the acrylic and we're going to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 go applying 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.480
 on the surface and look regard 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.840
 I had almost stained the advantage of 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.269
 the sealant is just that that is going 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.239
 to prevent the project from getting dirty 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.579
 once we finish with this we are going to 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.470
 apply another coat of the local sealer 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.670
 to put another one 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.450
 that belong perfect 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.540
 here and I raise if after the eyes the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.760
 we wash with water so that it does not dry 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.810
 acrylic once we finish this what 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.530
 what we are going to do is apply dimensional 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.300
 about decoupage and that gives you much more 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.069
 then with this volume clear what 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.170
 we are going to achieve is to give volume to 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.260
 some sections of the flowers we're going 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.540
 to fill and I do it over here so you have left 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.000
 in a I do not see anymore in this sense time that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.100
 cute girl came in when this dried up 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.350
 to give details we are not going to fill 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.680
 all dimensional simply in some 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 sectors is good grace and this step and 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.830
 this step continues in March of which 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.140
 let's put it back next Tuesday 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.280
 see you and continue with the third step 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.560
 let's see if we can finish it 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.560
 within the four programs and good
