games used to be where it's a lot about
the<00:01:36.969> spectacle<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.899> what's<00:01:38.350> going<00:01:38.619> on<00:01:38.890> and

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the spectacle of what's going on and

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.800 
the spectacle of what's going on and
then<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.640> mechanics<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.329> stuff<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:40.630> that

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
then the mechanics and stuff like that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.149 
then the mechanics and stuff like that
you<00:01:40.929> learn<00:01:41.140> as<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.439> game<00:01:41.590> gets<00:01:41.799> deeper<00:01:42.130> and

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
you learn as the game gets deeper and

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.190 
you learn as the game gets deeper and
deeper<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.579> deeper<00:01:42.640> but<00:01:43.360> but<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> art<00:01:43.899> style

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
deeper and deeper but but the art style

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.839 
deeper and deeper but but the art style
is<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.590> one<00:01:44.709> that<00:01:44.860> really<00:01:45.310> catches<00:01:45.489> my<00:01:45.819> eye

fighting<00:03:42.830> games<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.640> pretty<00:03:43.910> good

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
fighting games this is a pretty good

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.150 
fighting games this is a pretty good
opportunity<00:03:44.300> to<00:03:44.630> do<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.110> especially<00:03:45.470> for<00:03:45.890> one

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
opportunity to do so especially for one

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.500 
opportunity to do so especially for one
that<00:03:46.310> looks<00:03:46.459> as<00:03:46.610> good<00:03:46.760> as<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.030> game<00:03:47.239> could

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
that looks as good as this game could

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.360 
that looks as good as this game could
possibly<00:03:47.930> look<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:48.620> coming<00:03:48.890> out<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.010> ps4

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
possibly look and it's coming out on ps4

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.339 
possibly look and it's coming out on ps4
and<00:03:49.610> PlayStation<00:03:50.299> Vita<00:03:50.330> potentially<00:03:51.049> as<00:03:51.170> well

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
and PlayStation Vita potentially as well

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.839 
and PlayStation Vita potentially as well
I<00:03:51.379> think<00:03:51.590> they<00:03:51.890> even<00:03:51.980> have<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.250> stretch<00:03:52.580> goal

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
I think they even have a stretch goal

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.750 
I think they even have a stretch goal
for<00:03:53.180> Xbox<00:03:53.930> systems<00:03:54.349> -<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.860> if<00:03:55.220> chainsaw

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760
